23121062	[AII antagonists (candesartan and irbesartan) in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases]. Treatment of hypertension with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIA) was first limited to diabetics and patients with microalbuminuria. So far, results of several large clinical trials with AIIAs were published, confirming significant renoprotective effect of these agents compared to placebo (RENAAL and IRMA), amlodipin (MARVAL and IDNT) and a combination of ACEI and AIIA (CALM). In 2002, results of 2 large comparator studies in hypertension were published: LIFE - Losartan Intervention For Endpoints and SCOPE - the Study on COgnition and Prognosis in Elderly hypertensives. In 2003, a series of the CHARM studies involving patients with heart failure were published and, from than, AIIA have been used as an alternative to ACEI or in a combination with ACEI. MOSES study - Morbidity and mortality after stroke, eprosartan compared with nitrendipine for secondary prevention - results were published in 2005 and ONTARGET study, focusing on secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease, was published in 2008. The CORD study - Comparison of recommended doses - and the ACTIVE I study (AF Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for prevention of Vascular Events) were published in 2009. Candesartan was used in the CALM, SCOPE, RESOLVED and CHARM studies, irbesartan in the IRMA, IDNT and ACTIVE I.	0

20970556	De novo anti-HLA antibodies in renal allograft recipients: a cross-section study. BACKGROUND: The occurrence of anti-HLA antibodies plays a well established role in solid organ rejection. The development of x-MAP multiple bead technology (Luminex) has enabled more accurate detection and definition of these alloantibodies. METHODS: In 267 kidney transplant patients with stable allograft function for >= 3 years, we analyzed the presence of anti-HLA antibodies by Luminex technology. These patients had no alloantibodies before transplantation, and the immunosuppression treatment was: tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, everolimus, and/or sirolimus. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 267 patients showed anti-HLA class I antibodies and 12 showed anti-HLA class II antibodies, Seven patients had donor-specific antibodies (DSA): 1 anti-HLA class I, 5 anti-HLA class II, and 1 with both classes. No differences were found between DSA and the use or not of any specific therapy. However, in the retrospective review, we found a higher incidence of acute rejection episodes in the immediate posttransplant period among patients who developed class II DSA than those without DSA. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of patients with normal renal function who develop DSA beyond 3 years after transplantation was relatively low. Steroid or withdrawal replacement of calcineurin inhibitors with inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin seem to not be risk factors to increase the development of DSA. The finding that patients who developed DSA showed a higher rate of previous acute rejection episodes suggested that they should be monitored more frequently for HLA antibodies.	0

22010351	[Chemical constituents from Salvia przewalskii Maxim]. The investigation on Salvia przewalskii Maxim was carried out to find the relationship of the constituents and their pharmacological activities. The isolation and purification were performed by various chromatographies such as silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, RP-C18 column chromatography, etc. Further investigation on the fraction of the 95% ethanol extract of Salvia przewalskii Maxim yielded przewalskin Y-1 (1), anhydride of tanshinone-II A (2), sugiol (3), epicryptoacetalide (4), cryptoacetalide (5), arucadiol (6), 1-dehydromiltirone (7), miltirone (8), cryptotanshinone (9), tanshinone II A (10) and isotanshinone-I (11). Their structures were elucidated by the spectral analysis such as NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and MS (Mass Spectrometry). Compound 1 is a new compound. Compounds 4 and 5 are mirror isomers (1 : 3). Compounds 4, 5, 6, 8, 11 were isolated from Salvia przewalskii Maxim for the first time.	0
19544104	Metrics for comparing three word-based software programs used for augmentative and alternative communication. The purpose of this investigation was to conduct an analysis of a set of metrics developed for comparing features of software used in speech generating devices (SGD) for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). These metrics - measures of speed, efficiency, and accuracy - were employed during a sentence reconstruction task. Twenty two participants without disabilities reconstructed nine sentences using each of three SGD software programs, counterbalanced to remove order effects. Results revealed differences in the metrics across the software programs that were supported by a social validation survey completed by the participants. These results provide benchmark data about relative speed, accuracy, and efficiency of these software programs in structured use, and can inform professionals in matching potential AAC users with specific features of word-based software.	0
11113861	Validation of a model of colon cancer progression. A unique feature of SW480 and SW620 colon carcinoma cell lines is that they are derived from primary and secondary tumours resected from a single patient. As such, they may represent a valuable resource for examining genetic changes late in colon cancer progression. In order to verify this, both cell lines have been characterized to determine whether phenotypic differences have been retained despite long-term cell culture in vitro. The primary tumour-derived SW480 cells have an epithelioid morphology in vitro, while metastasis-derived SW620 cells have a fibroblast-like appearance. Xenografts of SW480 cells form gland-like structures in vivo, while SW620 xenografts form solid sheets of tumour cells. SW620 cells have a higher BrdU labelling index than SW480 cells, and are more highly tumourigenic and metastatic. Furthermore, SW620 cells show less susceptibility to apoptosis induction by TNFalpha and anti-Fas monoclonal. Findings from these investigations therefore indicate that SW480 and SW620 cell lines do show appropriate phenotypic differences and represent an interesting model for studying the genetic events in the late stages of colon cancer progression.	0
21837534	Tamsulosin and doxazosin as adjunctive therapy following shock-wave lithotripsy of renal calculi: randomized controlled trial. Alpha-blockers have been established as medical expulsive therapy for urolithiasis. We aimed to assess the effect of tamsulosin and doxazosin as adjunctive therapy following SWL for renal calculi. We prospectively included 150 patients who underwent up to four SWL sessions for renal stones from June 2008 to 2009. Patients were randomized into three groups of 50 patients each, group A (phloroglucinol 240 mg daily), group B (tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily plus phloroglucinol), and group C (doxazosin 4 mg plus phloroglucinol). The treatment continued up to maximum 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated for stone expulsion, colic attacks, amount of analgesics and side-effects of alpha-blockers. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding stone expulsion rates (84; 92 and 90%, respectively). The mean expulsion time of tamsulosin was significantly shorter than both control group (p = 0.002) and doxazosin (p = 0.026). Both number of colic episodes and analgesic dosage were significantly lower with tamsulosin as compared to control and doxazosin. Steinstrasse was encountered in 10 (6.7%) patients with no significant difference between the groups. 16 patients on tamsulosin and 21 on doxazosin experienced adverse effects related to postural hypotension. Moreover, 2 (4%) patients in the tamsulosin group reported ejaculatory complaints. In conclusion, adjunction of tamsulosin or doxazosin after SWL for renal calculi decreases the time for stone expulsion, amount of the analgesics and number colic episodes. There was no benefit regarding the overall stone expulsion rate. The side-effects of these agents are common and should be weighted against the benefits of their usage.	0
10892439	[Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 infection]. The isolation of a second retrovirus, HIV-2, led to fears that a second AIDS pandemic, similar in scope and magnitude to that caused by HIV-1, might ensue. However, the peculiar biologic properties of HIV-2, namely the lower transmissibility of this virus through both sexual and vertical routes, contributed to a more regionalized distribution of the virus, which became endemic in West Africa. HIV-2 is genetically more closely related to SIV than to HIV-1. When it comes to clinical disease, the spectrum of opportunistic infections and tumors (except for Kaposi sarcoma) are similar to that observed with HIV-1. Controlled longitudinal studies suggest that the rate of progression to advanced HIV related disease and mortality are far lower for HIV-2 than for HIV-1. Understanding how, immunologically and virologically, HIV-2 behaves differently from HIV-1 may provide some insight into the mechanisms governing HIV-1 pathogenesis.	0
15824932	The role of pre-operative templating in primary total knee replacement. Templating of preoperative X-rays is routinely performed before a total knee replacement. We performed this retrospective study on preoperative templating in primary total knee replacement to assess its accuracy and reproducibility. Preoperative radiographs of 47 patients were templated twice by two observers separately after a gap of 3 months. The size of actual implant used was compared to the size predicted by templating. Data were analysed to assess inter and intra-observer variation. Templating was accurate for both tibial and femoral components in only 53.2% of observations. This study also revealed that templating is a highly-subjective and observer-dependent technique. Inter-observer and intra-observer mismatch was present in 46.8% and 43.6% of readings respectively. We conclude from this study that preoperative templating is neither accurate nor reproducible.	0
18968047	Radiosensitivity study of cefazolin sodium. The extent of physico-chemical changes induced by irradiation of cefazolin sodium was investigated. The methods used were potency determination, impurity profile, colour measurements and pH measurements. The potency of irradiated samples at 25 kGy was 4+/-2% lower than that of the non irradiated ones. The total amount of related substances increased from 0.72+/-0.01% in the non irradiated samples to 4.9+/-0.7% in the samples irradiated at 25 kGy. Most of the peaks showed trace amounts (<0.01%), the largest one represented 1.2+/-0.5% of the total related substances. Only two peaks were identified by chromatography: the methyl-1,2,3-thiazol-2 thiol-5 and the 7-aminocephalosporanic acid. The latter related substance is only produced by the irradiation of cefazolin sodium. The pH values of the samples were within the specifications of the European Pharmacopoeia. The colour of the cefazolin sodium powder changed from white to yellow upon irradiation. The yellow colour persisted after the dissolution of the powder. Most of the tests carried out met the Pharmacopoeia's specifications, except the one concerning the colour of the solution.	0
23481098	Characterization of the sialic acid synthase from Aliivibrio salmonicida suggests a novel pathway for bacterial synthesis of 7-O-acetylated sialic acids. Resolving the enzymatic pathways leading to sialic acids (Sias) in bacteria are vitally important for understanding their roles in pathogenesis and for subsequent development of tools to combat infections. A detailed characterization of the involved enzymes is also essential due to the highly applicable properties of Sias, i.e., as used in a wide range of medical applications and human nutrition. Bacterial strains that produce Sias display them mainly on their cell surface to mimic animal cells thereby evading the host's immune system. Despite several studies, little is known about the virulence mechanisms of the fish pathogen Aliivibrio salmonicida. The genome of A. salmonicida LFI1238 contains a gene cluster homologous to the Escherichia coli neuraminic acid (Neu) gene cluster involved in biosynthesis of Sias found in the E. coli capsule. This cluster is probably responsible for the biosynthesis of Neu found in A. salmonicida. In this work, we have produced and characterized the sialic acid (Sia) synthase NeuB1, the key enzyme in the pathway. The Sia synthase is an enzyme producing N-acetylneuraminic acid by the condensation of N-acetylmannosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate. Genome content, kinetic data obtained, together with structural considerations, have led us to the prediction that the substrate for NeuB1 from A. salmonicida, E. coli and Streptococcus agalactiae among others, is 4-O-acetyl-N-acetylmannosamine. This means that the product of its enzymatic reaction is 7-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid. We propose a pathway for production of this Sia in A. salmonicida, and present evidence for the presence of diacetylated Neu in the bacterium.	0
20588209	The clinician's view of cardiac diagnostic imaging. In the last 30 years, non-invasive cardiac imaging was employed for the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease. Nuclear myocardial perfusion scintigraphy or stress echocardiography provide a high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of functionally significant coronary artery disease (CAD) and demonstrated incremental diagnostic and prognostic value over exercise electrocardiography and clinical variables. Recently, cardiac computed tomography has been increasingly used a non-invasive tool for the detection and quantification of coronary artery stenoses and calcifications. The increase in this technical \"offer\" induces a significant increase in the \"demand\" for non-invasive imaging assessment, with a rise in the number of imaging studies performed in the last years, which appropriateness, however, is often questionable. A critical evaluation of the use of imaging techniques in different clinical scenarios is briefly discussed.	0
11428893	E. coli Rep oligomers are required to initiate DNA unwinding in vitro. E. coli Rep protein is a 3' to 5' SF1 superfamily DNA helicase which is monomeric in the absence of DNA, but can dimerize upon binding either single-stranded or duplex DNA. A variety of biochemical studies have led to proposals that Rep dimerization is important for its helicase activity; however, recent structural studies of Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA have led to suggestions that SF1 helicases, such as E. coli Rep and E. coli UvrD, function as monomeric helicases. We have examined the question of whether Rep oligomerization is important for its DNA helicase activity using pre-steady state stopped-flow and chemical quenched-flow kinetic studies of Rep-catalyzed DNA unwinding. The results from four independent experiments demonstrate that Rep oligomerization is required for initiation of DNA helicase activity in vitro. No DNA unwinding is observed when only a Rep monomer is bound to the DNA substrate, even when fluorescent DNA substrates are used that can detect partial unwinding of the first few base-pairs at the ss-ds-DNA junction. In fact, under these conditions, ATP hydrolysis causes dissociation of the Rep monomer from the DNA, rather than DNA unwinding. These studies demonstrate that wild-type Rep monomers are unable to initiate DNA unwinding in vitro, and that oligomerization is required.	0
18314581	Bioinformatics tools for modeling transcription factor target genes and epigenetic changes. The combinatorial control of gene regulatory switches involves both transcription factor (TF) complexes and associated epigenetic modifications to the chromatin template. The novel high-throughput technologies, such as Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation ChIP-chip, have enabled genome-wide in vivo identification of TF target regulatory regions and related epigenetic modifications, which led to the view of highly dynamic TF-DNA interactions in activated or repressed promoters. Consequently, modeling and elucidating the combinatorial interaction of TFs and corresponding cis-regulatory modules in target promoters is of paramount interest. An estimated 5% of the genes in mammalian genomes code for TF proteins, and computational modeling of cis-regulatory logic would rapidly increase the pace of experimental confirmation of TF target promoters at the bench. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the use of different bioinformatics tools for predicting the target genes of TFs of interest in mammalian genomes, and the application of these methods in the analysis of ChIP-chip experimental data. The author describes most commonly used databases and prediction programs that are available on the World Wide Web and demonstrate the use of some of these programs by an example. A list of these programs is provided along with their web Uniform Resource Locator (URLs) and guidelines for successful application are suggested.	0
19234473	Highly conserved non-coding elements on either side of SOX9 associated with Pierre Robin sequence. Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is an important subgroup of cleft palate. We report several lines of evidence for the existence of a 17q24 locus underlying PRS, including linkage analysis results, a clustering of translocation breakpoints 1.06-1.23 Mb upstream of SOX9, and microdeletions both approximately 1.5 Mb centromeric and approximately 1.5 Mb telomeric of SOX9. We have also identified a heterozygous point mutation in an evolutionarily conserved region of DNA with in vitro and in vivo features of a developmental enhancer. This enhancer is centromeric to the breakpoint cluster and maps within one of the microdeletion regions. The mutation abrogates the in vitro enhancer function and alters binding of the transcription factor MSX1 as compared to the wild-type sequence. In the developing mouse mandible, the 3-Mb region bounded by the microdeletions shows a regionally specific chromatin decompaction in cells expressing Sox9. Some cases of PRS may thus result from developmental misexpression of SOX9 due to disruption of very-long-range cis-regulatory elements.	0
19563906	A novel approach for assessing protein synthesis in channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. A comprehensive understanding of animal growth requires adequate knowledge of protein synthesis (PS), which in fish, has traditionally been determined by the flooding dose method. However, this procedure is limited to short-term assessments and may not accurately describe fish growth over extended periods of time. Since deuterium oxide ((2)H(2)O) has been used to non-invasively quantify PS in mammals over short- and long-term periods, we aimed at determining if (2)H(2)O could also be used to measure PS in channel catfish. Fish were stocked in a 40-L aquarium with approximately 4% (2)H(2)O and sampled at 4, 8 and 24h (n=6 at each time period) to determine (2)H-labeling of body water (plasma), as well as protein-free and protein-bound (2)H-labeled alanine. The labeling of body water reflected that of aquarium water and the labeling of protein-free alanine remained constant over 24h and was approximately 3.8 times greater than that of body water. By measuring (2)H-labeled alanine incorporation after 24h of (2)H(2)O exposure we were able to calculate a rate of PS: 0.04+/-0.01% h(-1). These results demonstrate that PS in fish can be effectively measured using (2)H(2)O and, because this method yields integrative measures of PS, is relatively inexpensive and accounts for perturbations such as feeding, it is a novel and practical assessment option.	0
16458596	The effects of auditory attention measured from human electrocorticograms. OBJECTIVE: A central question in auditory electrophysiology has been whether selective attention can modulate exogenous components of the scalp-recorded N1 (the 'N1 effect'). Intracranial electrocorticograms were used in the current work to investigate this issue in greater anatomical detail. METHODS: Data were recorded from subdural electrodes placed across temporal cortex in 6 patient-volunteers undergoing diagnostic procedures for medically intractable epilepsy. Patients performed a dichotic listening task in which they alternately attended to a series of tones presented to both ears (mean ISI 800 ms) by responding to rare frequency deviants. RESULTS: Effects of attention were measured on the largest negative and positive waveform deflections observed between 70 and 220 ms post-stimulus for stimuli presented contralateral to grid location. Peak deflections were most often recorded from the upper bank of the posterior superior temporal gyrus at approximately 89 and 173 ms on average (labeled N90stg and P170stg, respectively). Selective attention had little effect on peak latencies but significantly increased the N90stg for 3 subjects, increased the P170stg for two subjects, and decreased the P170stg for two other subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Selective auditory attention can modulate neural response in auditory cortex. SIGNIFICANCE: The effects of attention on the scalp-recorded N1 component may arise in part from the enhancement of exogenous responses in temporal cortex.	0
22362945	Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. from horses: a retrospective study (2000-2010). The goal of this retrospective study was to have a comprehensive picture of the b-hemolytic streptococci of horses including tissue/organ distributions and susceptibility patterns against specific antimicrobials between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010. A total of 2,497 b-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from 2,391 cases, of which Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus was the most frequent isolate (72.0%). Other species isolated were Streptococcus dysgalactia subsp. equisimilis (21.3%), Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (5.8%), and unidentified b-hemolytic streptococci (0.9%). As expected, S. equi was mostly isolated from lymph node abscesses and the respiratory tract in foals and adult horses. Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus and S. equisimilis were mostly isolated from placenta, fetal tissues, and genital tract of horses; S. zooepidemicus and S. equisimilis were also recovered in significant numbers from a number of other organs including lung, liver, brain, kidney, and joints, indicating a much broader tissue tropism than S. equi. In addition, more than 1 Streptococcus spp. was recovered in 106 cases, indicating the co-existence of these bacteria in some horses. This data also suggested that S. equisimilis is a major bacterial agent of horses, contrary to present knowledge. Based on Kirby-Bauer antimicrobial susceptibility data, streptococci were found to be generally susceptible to cephalothin, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, penicillin, and ticarcillin and clavulanate. Resistance to antimicrobials has not developed over the years, except for gentamicin and tetracycline against S. equisimilis.	0
24312781	Determination of aflatoxins in nuts of Tabriz confectionaries by ELISA and HPLC methods. PURPOSE: Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of mycotoxins and secondary metabolites of various species of Aspergillus. There are various forms of aflatoxins including B1, B2, G1, G2, M1 and M2 types. Aflatoxins cause important health problems and have high potential effect on liver cancer. Therefore, numerous investigations have been conducted during last three decades. The aim of this work is to determine the contamination levels of nuts used by the confectionaries in Tabriz. METHOD: A total of 142 samples including 35 almond , 26 walnut, 4 seeds of apricot, 6 sunflower seeds kernel, 6 sesame seed, 6 peanuts , 32 pistachio,13 hazelnuts and 14 cashews samples were collected from Tabriz confectionaries. The ELISA method was employed for the screening of total aflatoxins. RESULT: In 13 cases (28.1% of pistachios, 5.1% of walnuts and 7.1% of cashews) contamination rate of higher than 15 ppb were observed. The HPLC method was applied for the confirmation of ELISA results. Aflatoxin B1 was the highest detected AFs. CONCLUSION: The overall results of the tested samples indicated that the rate of contamination of pistachios is higher than the other tested samples.	0
22345185	Surgical technique for aortic regurgitation attributable to Behcet's disease: modified aortic valve replacement with reinforcement of the aortic wall. Aortic regurgitation is a severe cardiovascular complication of Behcet's disease, resulting in high mortality rates within the Asian population. Standard surgical interventions have resulted in poor results in the long term. We herein report on a modified aortic valve replacement technique coupled with reinforcement of the aortic wall. During this procedure, Teflon felts and continuous mattress stitches were used to reinforce the aortic wall in order to prevent prosthetic valve detachment and formation of an aortic pseudoaneurysm. Postoperative examinations revealed that this procedure had satisfactory mid-term results.	0
23806931	One-stage procedure using spinal accessory nerve (XI)-innervated free muscle for facial paralysis reconstruction. BACKGROUND: For the treatment of facial paralysis, functioning free muscle transplantation has become accepted standard treatment. Choice of donor nerve and number of surgery stages, however, are still matters of great debate. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2011, 36 patients (out of 329; 11 percent) with 42 functioning free muscle transplantations were treated using spinal accessory nerve (XI)-innervated muscle for facial reanimation as a one-stage procedure. Indications included bilateral or unilateral M  bius syndrome, severe postparetic facial synkinesis, and patient preference. Postoperative smile training was required to achieve spontaneous smile. For outcome assessment, patients were evaluated using multidisciplinary methods, including objective smile excursion score (range, 0 to 4), cortical adaptation stage (range, I to V), tickle test, and subjective patient questionnaire and satisfaction score (range, 1 to 5). RESULTS: Mean smile excursion score improved from 0.5 preoperatively to 3.4 postoperatively. Eighty-three percent of patients were able to perform independent and even spontaneous smile after 1 year of follow-up. Ninety percent of patients had a mean satisfaction score of 3.4 out of 5. However, 50 percent expressed more concern with aesthetic appearance than functional status. There was no functional morbidity of the donor shoulder in daily life. CONCLUSIONS: The classic two-stage procedure is still the first choice for facial paralysis reconstruction. However, the effectiveness of XI-innervated free muscle for facial reanimation in a one-stage procedure has proven it to be a good alternative treatment. It has become second in popularity for facial paralysis reconstruction in the authors' center. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.	0

14585185	trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid reduces insulin-like growth factor-II secretion in HT-29 human colon cancer cells. We previously demonstrated that a mixture of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers decreases colon cancer incidence in rats treated with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Our in vitro studies have also shown that CLA inhibits the growth of HT-29 cells, a human colon cancer cell line. When we compared the individual potencies of the two main isomers found in the mixture of CLA isomers (e.g., cis-9, trans-11 [c9t11] and trans-10, cis-12 [t10c12]), t10c12 CLA decreased viable cell numbers in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, c9t11 CLA had no effect. Therefore, the present study examined whether the decreased cell growth is related to changes in secretion of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II and/or IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that have been shown to regulate HT-29 cell proliferation. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium with various concentrations of the individual CLA isomers, and immunoblot analysis of 24-hour, serum-free, conditioned media using a monoclonal anti-IGF-II antibody was performed. HT-29 cells secreted both mature 7,500 apparent molecular weight (M(r)) and higher-M(r) forms of IGF-II. t10c12 CLA decreased the levels of the higher-M(r) and the mature form of IGF-II in a dose-dependent manner, whereas c9t11 CLA had no effect. Ligand blot analysis of conditioned medium using (125)I-IGF-II revealed that the production of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4 was also decreased by t10c12 CLA, whereas c9t11 CLA had no effect. Exogenous IGF-II abrogated the growth inhibition induced by t10c12 CLA. These results indicate that inhibition of HT-29 cell growth by t10c12 CLA may be mediated by decreasing IGF-II secretion in these cells.	0
20028353	Phosphatidylethanol and alcohol consumption in reproductive age women. BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol disorders are preventable, but self-reported alcohol consumption can be misleading and impede effective treatment. Biomarkers represent an alternative method for assessing alcohol use, and this study evaluated the relationship between blood phosphatidylethanol (PEth) and alcohol use in a sample of reproductive age women. METHODS: Alcohol use was estimated by validated self-report methods in 80 nonpregnant women ages 18 to 35. PEth was measured by a contracted laboratory using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Regression methods appropriate for the distribution of PEth were used to define its relationship to alcohol consumption during the prior 2 weeks and explore the effects of drinking patterns on this association. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity of PEth for various drinking levels at 95% specific cutoffs. RESULTS: PEth had a positive linear association with grams of alcohol consumed (p < 0.001), and was detectable in 93% of subjects consuming an average of 2 or more drinks per day. The relationship between total alcohol consumption and PEth may be stronger in women with recent heavy drinking days. The relationship between drinking and PEth varied considerably between individuals, and sensitivity for a certain amount of drinking was low at a highly specific cutoff concentration. CONCLUSIONS: PEth is a highly sensitive indicator of moderate and heavy alcohol consumption in reproductive age women and may complement the use of self-report alcohol screens when additional objective markers of alcohol use are desirable. However, choosing a highly valid cutoff concentration for PEth to differentiate various levels of alcohol consumption may not be feasible.	0
11810531	Influence of macrolides on guanosine diphospho-D-mannose dehydrogenase activity in Pseudomonas biofilm. The formation of biofilm is regarded as a major cause of intractable infectious disease. Our studies were done to elucidate the action of a 14-membered-ring macrolide (erythromycin; EM) and a 16-membered-ring macrolide (midecamycin; MDM) on guanosine diphospho-d-mannose dehydrogenase (GDP-mannose dehydrogenase; GMD), one of the constituents of bacterial biofilm that is known to produce alginate. The mucoid type of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PT-1578 and the non-mucoid type of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were grown with nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor media. Comparative measurements were made of their GMD enzyme activities, with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), a cell membrane enzyme, used as a control. It was found that the GMD enzyme activity of mucoid type of Pseudomonas bacteria increased when they were grown on nutrient-poor media. Measurements were also made to determine the effects of EM and MDM against GMD and G6PDH enzyme activities. In media with either EM or MDM added, the production of G6PDH was not inhibited, irrespective of the concentration of EM or MDM. However, EM was effective against the production of GMD, showing a concentration-dependent effect. Scanning electron microscopy studies were also carried out to determine the effects of both macrolides on bacterial alginate production. It was found that reduction of alginate content occurred after the addition of EM. When environmental conditions for bacteria deteriorate, GMD enzyme is activated, production of alginate is initiated, and then biofilm is formed. Our results suggest that EM may have an inhibitory effect on the GMD production cycle, hence inhibiting the formation of biofilm. This may explain the differences in the clinical usefulness of 14-membered-and 16-membered-ring macrolides against biofilm disease.	0
8926278	Transcriptional repression of the prointerleukin 1beta gene by heat shock factor 1. Heat shock factor 1 activates the promoters of heat shock genes at elevated temperatures through its interaction with heat shock elements. We have examined a new role for heat shock factor 1 in the repression of the prointerleukin 1beta gene in human monocytes responding to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Both exposure to elevated temperatures and heat-independent heat shock factor 1 expression repressed the transcription of the prointerleukin 1beta gene, and repression was strictly dependent on an intact consensus heat shock element in the prointerleukin 1beta promoter to which heat shock factor 1 bound. This is the first demonstration of heat shock factor 1 as a transcriptional repressor and suggests a role for the factor in the counter-regulation of cytokine gene transcription.	1

12356582	Autoantibodies against granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor are diagnostic for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by the accumulation of phospholipids and surfactant proteins in the lung. The central role for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in surfactant homeostasis has been established in mice lacking the GM-CSF gene, which results in murine pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. No GM-CSF gene defect has been defined in adult patients with idiopathic PAP. Previous studies indicated that the human disease differs from the murine model by the presence of circulating, neutralizing autoantibodies against GM-CSF. Therefore, the final common pathway between the GM-CSF knockout and human PAP appears to be the deficiency of functionally active GM-CSF. In the present study, all patients with idiopathic PAP were found to have systemic and localized antibodies against GM-CSF. Anti-GM-CSF titers were a specific and sensitive marker for PAP. In addition, we present data showing that the absence of active GM-CSF is associated with enhanced levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-8. These studies confirm and strengthen previous studies and support the concept that adult idiopathic PAP is an autoimmune disease defined by the presence of anti-GM-CSF. Further, using anti-GM-CSF as an indicator of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis may avoid the use of more invasive means of evaluating patients with pulmonary disease characterized by alveolar infiltrates.	0
10572007	Identification of essential histidine residues in 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid 8-phosphate synthase: analysis by chemical modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate and site-directed mutagenesis. The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid 8-phosphate (KDO 8-P) synthase from Escherichia coli that catalyzes the aldol-type condensation of D-arabinose 5-phosphate (A 5-P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to give KDO 8-P and inorganic phosphate (P(i)) is inactivated by diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). The inactivation is first-order in enzyme and DEPC. A second-order rate constant of 340 M(-1) min(-1) is obtained at pH 7.6 and 4 degrees C. The rate of inactivation is dependent on pH and the pH-inactivation rate data imply the involvement of an amino acid residue with a pK(a) value of 7.3. KDO 8-P synthase activity is not restored to the DEPC-inactivated enzyme following treatment with hydroxylamine. Complete loss of KDO 8-P synthase activity correlates with the ethoxyformylation of three histidine residues by DEPC. KDO 8-P synthase is protected against DEPC inactivation by PEP and partially protected against inactivation by A 5-P. To provide further evidence for the involvement or role of the histidine residues in the aldol-type condensation catalyzed by KDO 8-P synthase, all six histidines were individually mutated to either glycine or alanine. The kinetic constants for the three mutants H40A, H67G, and H246G were unaffected as compared to the wild type enzyme. In contrast, H241G demonstrates a >10-fold increase in K(M) for both PEP and A 5-P and a 4-fold reduction in k(cat), while H97G demonstrates an increase in K(M) for only A 5-P and a 2-fold reduction in k(cat). The activity of the H202G mutant was too low to be measured accurately but the data obtained indicated an approximate 400-fold reduction in k(cat). Circular dichroism measurements of the wild-type and mutant enzymes indicate modest structural changes in only the fully active H67G and H246G mutants. The H241G mutant is protected against DEPC inactivation by PEP and A 5-P to the same extent as the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the functionally important H241 may not be located in the vicinity of the substrate binding sites. The H97G mutant is protected by PEP against DEPC inactivation to the same degree as the wild-type enzyme but is no longer protected by A 5-P. In the case of the H202G mutant, both A 5-P and PEP protect the mutant against DEPC inactivation but to different extents from those observed for the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic activity of the H97G mutant is partially restored (20% --> 60% of wild-type activity) in the presence of imidazole, while a minor amount of activity is restored to the H202G mutant (<1% --> 4% of wild-type activity) in the presence of imidazole.	0

9243429	Pathways to orthodontic care. BACKGROUND: The research described in this paper arose out of the need to address the growing waiting list for orthodontic treatment in Northamptonshire. Although the prevalence of dento-facial anomalies is the same across time, sex, race and socio-economic class, studies in the United States and this country suggest that certain groups are over-represented among patients who receive orthodontic treatment. The introduction of valid and reliable indices of therapeutic need such as the index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) will allow improved focusing of services. The aim of the study was to determine the variables affecting access to orthodontic care, and the extent to which services were delivered according to objective measures of need. METHODS: Analyses were undertaken for speed, appropriateness, timing of referral, duration and complexity of the pathway for new referrals to specialist orthodontic care. possible explanations for the length of pathway were examined, including socio-demographic factors, location of residence and the IOTN. RESULTS: A total of 405 patients were approached, of whom 400 (99 per cent) agreed to participate. There was an over-representation among socio-economic groups I and V among patients referred to orthodontic treatment. By contrast, those of male sex and from socio-economic class IV were under-represented. This appeared to be the case irrespective of treatment setting. There was also a wide range of waiting times to treatment and complexity of pathway. Over a quarter of the sample had been inappropriately referred, and objective need as measured by the IOTN was not a determinant in the speed of access to specialist treatment. Adult patients waited longer for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the delivery of care is neither based on objective need nor equitably distributed. More appropriate directing of resources is required, using the IOTN and agreed protocols, so that referrals are made to the most suitable provider.	0
11833933	Ovulation in the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) induced by gonadotrophins. The induction of ovulation by exogenous gonadotrophins is an important approach for recovering oocytes used for studies on the reproductive biology of some mammals. In the present study, pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) were used to induce ovulation in the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) using the following regimens. Groups A1-A3, multiple injections of PMSG (30-60 IU) followed by a single dose of hCG (30-60 IU); B1, combination of a single injection of PMSG (60 IU) with a single dose of hCG (60 IU); E1, combination of a single injection of PMSG (60 IU) with a single dose of hCG (30 IU) plus PMSG (30 IU); and administration of either PMSG (C1 and C2) or hCG (D1). The ovulation rate of animals producing oocytes with either first polar body or distinct perivitelline space, and the mean number of oocytes per animal were considered the most important criteria in each regimen. The most effective induction of ovulation was achieved in groups B1 and E1, with ovulation rates of 4/4 and 4/4, respectively, and mean numbers of ovulated oocytes per animal of 3.25 +/- 0.48 and 4.00 +/- 0.71 respectively. No ovulation was observed in the control group or in group D1. Therefore, regimes B1 and E1 were considered as the simplest and most effective for the induction of ovulation in the tree shrew.	0
9117462	Eliminating access to anonymous HIV antibody testing in North Carolina: effects on HIV testing and partner notification. Anonymous HIV testing may attract persons who might otherwise not be tested but may hinder partner notification. We evaluated the effects on North Carolina's HIV testing and partner notification programs of policy changes that eliminated and later restored anonymous testing in 82 counties. We used an interrupted time-series design to compare counties eliminating with counties retaining anonymous testing. We analyzed HIV testing and partner notification data from before, during, and after elimination of anonymous testing. After elimination of anonymous testing in 82 counties, the mean monthly level of testing (+/- SE) increased by 45%, or 548 (+/- 123) tests per month, while in 18 counties that retained anonymous testing, there was a 63% increase, or 802 (+/- 162) tests per month (p > .05). Among men of all races, testing increased by 16%, or 155 (+/- 35) tests per month, in counties that eliminated anonymous testing; and by 51%, or 305 (+/- 42) tests per month (p < .05), in counties that retained anonymous testing. After elimination of anonymous testing, both county types experienced similar increases in the rate of partners notified. However, partner notification was more successful if the index patient was tested confidentially; 2.7 times as many partners per index patient were notified and counseled. There was no effect on testing or on partner notification rates following restoration of anonymous testing. Substantial community opposition to eliminating anonymous testing was encountered. The policy change appeared to result in a slight decrease in testing among men and a slight increase in partners notified. Programs considering the elimination of anonymous testing should weigh these potential gains and losses, as well as the impact on relationships between the public health and advocacy communities	0
9205671	Diabetic nephropathy: an observational study on patients attending a joint diabetes renal clinic. Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of renal failure, accounting for 20% of patients starting dialysis. In clinical trials, effective blood-pressure control, especially by angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), retards the rate of progression of renal failure substantially. We examined these effects in clinical practice by surveying patients at a joint diabetes renal clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary from 1989 to 1995. We examined the relationship between progression of diabetic nephropathy, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and the use of ACEIs. The average MAP of the whole group of patients fell by 7%, the urine albumin:creatinine ratio fell by 29%, and the rate of progression as measured by the slope of reciprocal of serum creatinine with time (l/mumol/day) was slowed, from -4.59 to -2.76. This is equal to delaying the necessity for dialysis by about 2 years. The joint clinic met its aim and was cost-effective.	0

A wavelength-tuned Fizeau interferometer is applied to the problem of flatness testing of transparent plates. When the plate is positioned at a specific distance from the reference surface and an integer-math 13-frame phase-shifting algorithm is applied, the system directly filters out unwanted interference arising from backsurface reflections. The resulting front-surface profile exhibits less than 2 nm of residual error attributable to spurious reflections from within the plate.	0

7529458	The survival of cultured mouse cerebellar granule cells is not dependent on elevated potassium-ion concentration. The effects of K(+)-induced membrane depolarization were studied on the survival and biochemical parameters in mouse and rat cerebellar granule cells grown in micro-well cultures. Cell numbers were determined by estimating DNA content using the Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome binding assay. DNA from degenerated cells was removed by prior DNAase treatment. These DNA estimates of cell numbers were comparable with values obtained by direct counting of fluorescein diacetate-stained viable cells. In agreement with previous studies, the survival of rat granule cells was promoted by increasing the concentration of K+ in the medium from 5 to 25 mM throughout a 7-day culture period. In contrast, mouse granule cells survived in culture containing 'low' K+ (5 or 10 mM), as well as in the presence of 'high' K+ (25 mM). On the other hand, several biochemical parameters in mouse granule cells were markedly increased by cultivation in 'high' as compared with 'low' K(+)-containing media, demonstrated by increased fluorescein diacetate esterase activity, enhanced rate of NADPH-dependent tetrazolium reduction, augmented 2-deoxy-D-glucose accumulation and increased N-methyl-D-aspartate-evoked 45Ca2+ influx. It was concluded that although cultivation in 'high' K+ promotes biochemical differentiation in mouse cerebellar granule cells, these cells differ from their rat counterparts in that they do not develop a survival requirement for K(+)-induced membrane depolarization.	0
19670117	Surgical management of chylothorax. BACKGROUND: Chylothorax remains an uncommon but challenging clinical problem. Thoracic duct ligation is the treatment of choice for postsurgical patients. However, the optimal treatment for traumatic patients is unclear. We wanted to examine the outcomes of patients with high output or recurrent chylothorax who were treated by surgical means. METHODS: From December 1992 to April 2008, 29 patients underwent surgical procedures for high output (> 1 L/day) (16) or recurrent chylothorax (13). We analyzed these patients to determine the surgical approach, perioperative complications, and outcomes of the treatment approach. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, 12 patients developed chylothorax following esophagectomy, in 5 patients it resulted from lymphoproliferative disorders, in 2 patients following ascending aneurysm repair, in 2 after trauma, in 3 following lung resection, and in 1 patient respectively from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), thymectomy for thymoma, vasculitis, and metastatic lung cancer, while 1 patient had no clear etiology. The median age of patients was 61 (range 20-79) years. 22 patients initially underwent thoracic duct ligation, 6 had talc pleurodesis, and one underwent bilateral pleuroperitoneal shunt placement. Approaches for thoracic duct ligation included: right thoracotomy (16), left thoracotomy (3), VATS (2), and right thoracotomy together with laparotomy (1). There were no intraoperative complications or deaths within 30 days or during postoperative hospitalization. The success rate after initial thoracic duct ligation was 95 % (21/22). One patient needed re-exploration after ligation with resolution of chylothorax after the second operation. The success rate after pleurodesis was 83 % (5/6). One patient after pleurodesis needed subsequent thoracic duct ligation for resolution of bilateral chylothoraces. All patients in this series had resolution of chylothorax. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic duct ligation is the treatment of choice for high output or recurrent chylothorax with a 96 % success rate. Surgical pleurodesis is effective in some cases and may be an option for marginal patients.	0

The computed tomographic (CT) and sonographic appearances of the late stages of pancreatic damage in three patients with cystic fibrosis are illustrated. All three had severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with steatorrhea. In two patients CT revealed complete fatty replacement of the entire pancreas. In the third, increased echogenicity of the pancreas on sonography and the inhomogeneous attenuation on CT were interpreted as being the result of a combination of fibrosis, fatty replacement, calcification, and probable cyst formation.	0
15508054	[Haemolytic disease of the newborn--from a mother with anti-Kell, anti-E and anti-Vel anti-erythrocyte alloantibodies]. A grave form of HDN (haemolytic disease of the new-born) is described in female twins, caused by Kell, E and Vel isoimmunisation. The weakly vital and anaemic new-born babies were hospitalised with signs of respiratory distress on the first day of their life after the delivery by Caesarean section in the 38 (th) week of pregnancy in the General Hospital Dubrovnik. Already during the first hours of their life jaundice developed with a high bilirubin level for their age. The direct Coombs' test on the twins and the indirect Coombs' test on the mother were positive. Immuno-haematological analysis proved the presence of anti-Kell, anti-E and the very rare anti-Vel antibodies in the mother's serum and in the plasma of both twins. We had no possibility to obtain appropriate blood for the indicated exsanguine transfusion because cross-probes with the accessible blood samples were positive. Up to the fourteenth day of life the anaemia deepened and was aggravated in one twin, the Kell positive one (phenotype CcDEe,Kk) in relation to the other, the Kell negative (phenotype CcDEe,kk) twin. The recovery of the female twins started on the 15 (th) day of life, after the transfusion of blood (phenotype: 0,ccddee, Vel negative, Kel negative), received from the bank of rare blood groups in London. This is the first described case of haemolytic disease of the new-born caused by antibodies on the antigen Kell, E and Vel. The low frequency of immunisation with rare antigens such as Kell, E and Vel, does not exclude the possibility of the occurrence of grave forms of haemolytic disease. All pregnant women with a positive indirect Coombs' test should be further immuno-haematologically tested in order to identify the antibodies type so that the treatment of the new-borns could be commenced in time.	0
23864536	Healthy feeding habits: efficacy results from a cluster-randomized, controlled exploratory trial of a novel, habit-based intervention with parents. BACKGROUND: As dietary gatekeepers for young children, parents are often the proximal target of family-based dietary interventions. Habit theory offers a novel approach to modifying parental feeding, based on \"context-dependent repetition\" to promote automatic responding and to reduce decisional conflict. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory trial evaluated an intervention promoting habit formation for 3 parental feeding behaviors: serving fruit/vegetables, serving healthy snacks, and serving nonsweetened drinks. The primary outcome was parental habit strength for each behavior. The secondary outcome was children's food intake. DESIGN: Parents of children aged 2-6 y (n = 126) were recruited from 6 children's centers in London and cluster-randomized to intervention (n = 3) or no-treatment control (n = 3) conditions. Parents in the intervention group (n = 58) received training on habit formation for 3 feeding behaviors; control participants (n = 68) were asked only to complete the measures. At baseline and after treatment, parents completed validated measures of subjective \"automaticity\" for feeding behaviors and a brief child food-frequency measure. Parents in the intervention group were interviewed about the program. The change between groups, after clustering was controlled for, was analyzed. RESULTS: For all parental feeding behaviors, automaticity increased more in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.01 for all). Significant intervention effects on children's intake of vegetables (P = 0.003), healthy snacks (P = 0.009), and water (P = 0.032) were observed. Changes in children's food intake correlated with changes in parental automaticity of feeding behaviors, and program acceptability was high. CONCLUSIONS: A habit-based intervention successfully modified parental feeding behaviors, affected children's diets positively, and was well received by parents. Habit theory provides a promising new tool to support family-based obesity prevention. This trial was registered as ISRCTN09910187.	0

7058764	Diltiazem for long-term therapy of coronary arterial spasm. The first 36 patients with coronary arterial spasm treated with diltiazem and followed up at the Stanford University Coronary Artery Spasm Clinic for 6 months or longer are described. There were 13 men and 23 women with a mean age of 50.2 years; the mean duration of angina was 36.1 months. All patients had angina at rest with a good or fail response to sublingual nitroglycerin. During a mean of 17.5 months of diltiazem therapy, the frequency of angina was reduced from a mean of 21.5 to 1.3 attacks/week. This 94 percent reduction in pain frequency occurred when either 240 or 360 mg of diltiazem was administered daily. Sixteen patients required the addition of isosorbide dinitrate to achieve a painfree state. Pain breakthrough occurred a mean of 1.7 times during the 17.5 month follow-up period but tended to be of short duration. Six patients had trace to 1+ pedal edema and no other adverse effects occurred. It is concluded that diltiazem is highly effective and well tolerated for the long-term prophylaxis and treatment of angina in patients with coronary spasm.	0

7738524	Was Julius Caesar's epilepsy due to a brain tumor? Two thousand thirty-eight years later, in the setting of a similar care presentation, a physician would take a detailed history and perform a clinical and neurological examination. A preliminary diagnosis would be entertained and followed by electroencephalography and magnetic resonance of the brain with and without paramagnetic contrast for diagnostic confirmation. The proper medical or surgical treatment would then be instituted. A reconstruction of the clinical history of Julius Caesar (100-44 B.C.) has been attempted from available information from literature. Although a definite conclusion obviously cannot be made, a differential diagnosis provided with a tentative hypothesis is presented. The patient had late onset of seizures in the last two years of his life, headaches, personality changes. Upon reexamination of existing Julius Caesar iconography, busts, statues and minted coins no skull deformities have been noted. Identification of a skull deformity as described by Suetonius would have confirmed the suspicion of meningioma involving the convexity of the cerebral hemispheres. Meningioma or slow-growing supratentorial glioma may well have been responsible for this man's illness. Who knows how the course of history might have been changed... Probably not at all.	0
21970650	Mental representations of arithmetic facts: evidence from eye movement recordings supports the preferred operand-order-specific representation hypothesis. There are three main hypotheses about mental representations of arithmetic facts: the independent representation hypothesis, the operand-order-free single-representation hypothesis, and the operand-order-specific single-representation hypothesis. The current study used electrical recordings of eye movements to examine the organization of arithmetic facts in long-term memory. Subjects were presented single-digit addition and multiplication problems and were asked to report the solutions. Analyses of the horizontal electrooculograph (HEOG) showed an operand order effect for multiplication in the time windows 150-300  ms (larger negative potentials for smaller operand first problems than for larger operand first ones). The operand order effect was reversed in the time windows from 400 to 1,000  ms (i.e., larger operand first problems had larger negative potentials than smaller operand first problems). For addition, larger operand first problems had larger negative potentials than smaller operand first in the series of time windows from 300 to 1,000  ms, but the effect was smaller than that for multiplication. These results confirmed the dissociated representation of addition and multiplication facts and were consistent with the prediction of the preferred operand-order-specific representation hypothesis.	0

15954545	Inherited congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in Cairn terriers. The pathogenesis of congenital portosystemic shunt (CPSS) in dogs still is incompletely understood. In Irish Wolfhounds and Yorkshire Terriers, CPSS is reported to be hereditary. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible genetic basis and the mode of inheritance of CPSS in Cairn Terriers. Between July 1990 and July 2001, 6-week-old pups of the Dutch Cairn Terrier population were screened by measuring venous ammonia concentrations and in the presence of hyperammonemia by ultrasonography, autopsy, portal vein angiography, or exploratory celiotomy. The same successfully operated female was used 3 times in test matings with an unrelated affected male, her unaffected sire, and an affected offspring. The prevalence of CPSS in the general Cairn Terrier population, the direct progeny of frequently used males, and the offspring of the test matings were tested for significant differences. In total, 6,367 Cairn Terriers were screened; 32 males and 26 females had CPSS. In 3 large family groups, significantly higher prevalences were found compared with the general population (P < .0001, P < .0001, and P < .044). The prevalence of CPSS in the offspring of the test matings was significantly higher (P < .002) than in the general population. No sex predisposition occurred among the affected dogs. The higher prevalence of CPSS in the test matings and the 3 family groups compared with the general population indicates that CPSS in Cairn Terriers is a genetic disease. The inheritance is autosomal and most likely polygenic or monogenic with variable expression.	0
16833033	Early poststroke seizures. We define as early seizure (ES) those occurring within 7 days after stroke and late seizures those developing beyond 1 week after stroke. Seizures are well known to occur at the onset of intracerebral hemorrhage and serve as a clinical marker. Onset seizures may be focal or generalized, are usually brief and are associated with loss of consciousness in the setting of hemorrhage. A similar concept of immediate seizure occurs in traumatic brain injury. Predictive factors of ES can be classified of general and neurologic origin. An important question is whether ES per se worsen prognosis and outcome. The viability of the penumbral region in animal models of focal ischemia is influenced by the peri-infarct depolarization waves. If this also is true in humans, seizures in the immediate poststroke period might worsen outcome. Recently, hypercholesterolemia has been associated with better functional outcome at 1 month after a first-ever stroke, and multivariate analysis studies have shown that mean cholesterol values were lower in patients with ES compared with controls.	0

21344284	The biosynthesis of n-[(2)H (7)] fatty acids byArthrobacter globiformis from [U-(2)H (15)] octanoic acid. The principal fatty acids present whenArthrobacter globiformis is grown on a glycine medium free of normal fatty acids were found to be the C15 and C16 anteiso fatty acids; only a small amount of the normal fatty acids (C14 and C16) were present. Cells grown on the same medium but supplemented mented with 0.1 mg/ml [U-(2)H(15)]octanoic acid were found to contain an increased amount of the normal fatty acids and these fatty acids were found to be labeled with 7 deuteriums. I concluded that the octanoic acid is degraded by b-oxidation in these cells to [U-(2)H(7)] butyryl-CoA, which then competes with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA for the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis.	0

10833033	Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry with supersonic molecular beams A new approach for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is described, based on achieving soft thermal vaporization followed by supersonic expansion and direct sample compound ionization, while in a supersonic molecular beam (SMB). The soft molecular vaporization step utilizes spray formation that is continued by fast thermal vaporization inside a channel supersonic nozzle, followed by ultrafast supercooling in a supersonic expansion. The short time (several microseconds) spent by the vaporized compound in the heated nozzle prior to its expansion cooling may result in incomplete vibrational equilibrium and thus reduced degree of dissociation. In addition, even if vibrational equilibrium at the nozzle temperature is obtained, the sample compounds have significantly reduced time for their dissociation, which is thus further minimized (kinetic consideration). As soon as the molecules expand and form a SMB, they are supercooled and any further dissociation is avoided. While in the SMB, the sample molecules can be ionized either by electron ionization as described in this paper or by hyperthermal surface ionization. The major goal of this method is to obtain high quality library searchable electron ionization mass spectra, for a broad range of thermally labile compounds, with higher sensitivity than that achievable by particle beam LC-MS. The soft thermal vaporization nozzle is described and mass spectral results with corticosterone are demonstrated. The potential advantageous features of this new method are discussed.	0
16627645	Psychromonas ingrahamii sp. nov., a novel gas vacuolate, psychrophilic bacterium isolated from Arctic polar sea ice. A gas vacuolate bacterium, designated strain 37T, was isolated from a sea ice core collected from Point Barrow, Alaska, USA. Cells of strain 37T were large (6-14 microm in length), rod-shaped, contained gas vacuoles of two distinct morphologies, and grew well at NaCl concentrations of 1-10 % and at temperatures of -12 to 10 degrees C. The DNA G+C content was 40 mol%. Whole-cell fatty acid analysis showed that 16 : 1omega7c comprised 67 % of the total fatty acid content. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that this bacterium was closely related to members of the genus Psychromonas, with highest sequence similarity (96.8 %) to Psychromonas antarctica. Phenotypic analysis differentiated strain 37T from P. antarctica on the basis of several characteristics, including cell morphology, growth temperature range and the ability to hydrolyse polymers. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed a level of relatedness of 37 % between strain 37T and P. antarctica, providing further support that it represents a distinct species. The name Psychromonas ingrahamii sp. nov. is proposed for this novel species. The type strain is 37T (=CCUG 51855T=CIP 108865T).	0
23556822	An active one-particle microrheometer: incorporating magnetic tweezers to total internal reflection microscopy. We present a novel microrheometer by incorporating magnetic tweezers in the total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) that enables measuring of viscoelastic properties of materials near solid surface. An evanescent wave generated by a solid   liquid interface in the TIRM is used as the incident light source in the microrheometer. When a probe particle (of a few micrometers diameter) moves near the interface, it can interact with the evanescent field and reflect its position with respect to the interface by the scattered light intensity. The exponential distance dependence of the evanescent field, on the one hand, makes this technique extremely sensitive to small changes from z-fluctuations of the probe (with a resolution of several nanometers), and on the other, it does not require imaging of the probe with high lateral resolution. Another distinct advantage is the high sensitivity in determining the z position of the probe in the absence of any labeling. The incorporated magnetic tweezers enable us to effectively manipulate the distance of the embedded particle from the interface either by a constant or an oscillatory force. The force ramp is easy to implement through a coil current ramp. In this way, the local viscous and elastic properties of a given system under different confinements can therefore be measured by resolving the near-surface particle motion. To test the feasibility of applying this microrheology to soft materials, we measured the viscoelastic properties of sucrose and poly(ethylene glycol) solutions and compared the results to bulk rheometry. In addition, we applied this technique in monitoring the structure and properties of deformable microgel particles near the flat surface.	0

Oral oxymorphone is a new formulation of an existing parenteral opioid that has become available for the treatment of significant pain: acute postoperative, chronic arthritis, chronic low back, and chronic cancer pain. Oxymorphone is a typical mu-opioid agonist that is effective in both immediate- and extended-release (IR and ER) formulations. Oxymorphone is more lipid soluble than morphine, resulting in a rapid onset of action when given in tablet formulation, with a duration of action of approximately 4-6 hours in IR and 12 hours in ER preparations. Oxymorphone provides excellent pain relief for significant pain, with typical opioid side effects that are usually mild or moderate in intensity. Multiple double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of this new oral opioid preparation. Oral oxymorphone is an effective opioid that provides a new therapeutic option for the physician.	0
10359586	Evolution of antigen-specific T cell receptors in vivo: preimmune and antigen-driven selection of preferred complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) motifs. Antigen (Ag)-driven selection of helper T cells (Th) in normal animals has been difficult to study and remains poorly understood. Using the major histocompatibility complex class II- restricted murine response to pigeon cytochrome c (PCC), we provide evidence for both preimmune and Ag-driven selection in the evolution of Ag-specific immunity in vivo. Before antigenic challenge, most Valpha11(+)Vbeta3(+) Th (70%) express a critical complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) residue (glutamic acid at TCR-alpha93) associated with PCC peptide contact. Over the first 5 d of the primary response, PCC-responsive Valpha11(+)Vbeta3(+) Th expressing eight preferred CDR3 features are rapidly selected in vivo. Clonal dominance is further propagated through selective expansion of the PCC-specific cells with T cell receptor (TCR) of the \"best fit.\" Ag-driven selection is complete before significant emergence of the germinal center reaction. These data argue that thymic selection shapes TCR-alpha V region bias in the preimmune repertoire; however, Ag itself and the nongerminal center microenvironment drive the selective expansion of clones with preferred TCR that dominate the response to Ag in vivo.	0
12089885	[Usefulness of Uro-Vaxom in complex treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in girls]. Uro-Vaxom was used in the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in 35 girls. Most of them (34/35) tolerated the drug very well, no side effect were observed. We stopped administration of the Uro-Vaxom in one girl, during the first month of treatment because of vomiting. This way efficiency of Uro-Vaxom was evaluated in the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in 34 girls. Uro-Vaxom was found to be a valuable drug, supporting antibiotic therapy in recurrent urinary tract infections caused by E. coli.	0

8075158	A novel type of peroxidase gene from the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor. The wood-decaying fungus Trametes versicolor secretes a large number of peroxidase isozymes, presumed to partake in the degradation of lignin. From enzymic studies, two types of peroxidases have been distinguished: lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases. We here report the finding of a T. versicolor peroxidase gene, PG V, which displays several features not observed in previously studied peroxidase genes from white-rot fungi, such as a high number of introns (12). Eight of the 12 introns have positions equivalent to introns of peroxidase genes from another white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The gene structure of PG V appears to be primarily related to known lignin peroxidase genes, while the encoded mature 339-residue protein has several characteristics in common with manganese peroxidases. Analyses further indicate that PG V encodes a Ser instead of an Asn at a position regarded as invariant within the enzyme superfamily, with the side chain involved in hydrogen bonding with the distal His.	0
18165167	The ImageStream System: a key step to a new era in imaging. The aim of this article is to provide a brief review about the ImageStream system a novel tool for multiparameter cell analysis in flow. The instrument integrates the features of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy combined with a modern methodology for image analysis. Similar to flow cytometry, ImageStream allows analysis of a large number of cells based on their fluorescence features and provides statistical analysis of these features. Additionally, ImageStream allows detailed morphometric cellular analysis based on acquired cellular images integrating various morphometric and photometric features of the examined cells. Simply stated, ImageStream system is an advanced flow cytometer acquiring both integrated fluorescence signals as well as high quality fluorescence images and allowing muliparameter analysis. The innovative features of the instrument offer new analytical capabilities and allow for a multitude of possible applications beyond the current means of flow cytometry. While this article summarizes basic information about the features of ImageStream and its applications based on the available literature and it also describes our own experience.	0
12606093	An update on immunodiagnosis of cystic echinococcosis. Immunological parameters are increasingly investigated as possible markers for the development of cystic echinococcosis. Among the newer immunologic tests for assessing the host-parasite relationship, assay of immunoglobulin isotypes with the use of distinct parasite antigens and detection of Th1/Th2 cytokine expression are an interesting new approach. The findings upon which we have constructed our immunological hypothesis of the host-parasite relationship are: (1) immunoglobulin isotype profiles differ in patients with distinct clinical outcomes of the disease; in particular, antigen B is the antigen of choice to detect specific IgG4, which is the immunoglobulin isotype most clearly associated with the progression of the disease; (2) the isolation and characterisation of recombinant parasite proteins that behave as molecular markers of allergic reactions associated with cystic echinococcosis; (3) Th1/Th2 cell activation is involved in the clinical outcome of Echinococcus granulosus infection and, in particular Th2 response, is associated with susceptibility to the disease, whereas a Th1 response is associated with protective immunity.	0
22233591	Detection of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in patients with obstructive lung disease using exhaled breath profiling. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) has been implicated in the worsening of several respiratory disorders. Current methods of diagnosis lack accuracy, are invasive and can be costly. Recently, novel methods of analysing lung pathophysiology have been developed including the use of an electronic nose and analysis of components of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). We hypothesised that these methods would distinguish patients with GORD from those without GORD in the common obstructive lung diseases and healthy controls. In a cross-sectional study, exhaled breath was analysed using the Cyranose 320 electronic nose, using principal components and canonical discriminant analyses. EBC pH and pepsin were quantified using a pH meter and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. A standardized reflux disease questionnaire (RDQ) was used to assess reflux symptoms. The Cyranose 320 distinguished exhaled breath profiles of obstructive lung disease patients without GORD from obstructive lung disease patients with GORD (p = 0.023, accuracy 67.6%), asthmatic patients with reflux from asthmatics without GORD (85%, p = < 0.015, interclass M distance > 2.8), but did not produce as robust a profile for patients with COPD and COPD with GORD (p = 0.047, accuracy 64%). Patients with obstructive lung disease and GORD had significantly higher levels of EBC pepsin (9.81    interquartile range (IQR) 4.38 ng ml(-1)) than those without GORD (4.6    IQR 6.95 ng ml(-1)), as well as healthy controls (3.44    IQR 7.87 ng ml(-1); p = < 0.013). EBC pH was not significantly related to the presence of GORD in any group. The RDQ results correlated significantly with the presence of EBC pepsin. This pilot study has shown that exhaled breath profiling can be used for detecting GORD in obstructive lung diseases. While the electronic nose was useful in asthma, EBC pepsin was more helpful in COPD. In this study, several different confounders could potentially have affected results and larger prospective interventional studies are needed.	0

19259676	Two distinct patterns of ankylosing spondylitis in Moroccan patients. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is characterised by a geographic differences in terms of prevalence and clinical expression of the disease. The aim of our study was to describe the actual features of AS in Morocco and we wanted to examine a large population of patients for evidence of phenotypic clustering that could suggest the presence of distinct clinical entities. We investigated 117 patients with a diagnosis of primary AS according to the modified New York criteria. All patients were evaluated according to a standardised data collection form, including demographic variables and disease history with clinical and radiological features. To analyse our data and try to individualise clinical subsets, we applied a two-step cluster analysis using log-likelihood distance measures. Patient's mean age at onset was 25.51 +/- 10.8 year. The mean BASDAI and BASFI score was 33.5 +/- 20.3 and 38.9 +/- 27.5, respectively. Radiographic damage was present in 99.1% of the subjects and radiographic hip involvement in 47.3%. Only 52.6% of patients had been treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. Cluster analysis detected two distinct populations within the data set. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups particularly concerning activity of the disease, age at onset and the hygienic conditions. Our study revealed that the Moroccan AS was active and severe and suggested that the age at onset and the precarious hygienic level has the greatest capacity to predict activity and severity of the disease.	0

10219172	Growth and hydrolytic enzyme production of Capnocytophaga gingivalis on different protein substrates. Capnocytophaga gingivalis was grown with proteins (albumin, collagen, mucin and hemoglobin) as carbon and energy sources in chemostat culture. The mu max (0.34 h-1) and biomass yield (0.96 g.l-1) were as high with hemoglobin (3 g.l-1) as with glucose (3 g.l-1) (20). Albumin, collagen and mucin also supported an increased mu max, or yield or both, in comparison with basal (tryptone/thiamine) medium. In steady-state, trypsin-like protease specific activity increased 3- to 5-fold in the presence of albumin, collagen and hemoglobin: whereas the greatest increase (21-fold) in alpha-glucoside activity was in the presence of mucin. There were significant, but less substantial changes in other hydrolytic enzymes (aminopeptidase, acid and alkaline phosphatases). The bulk of the detected hydrolytic activity (> 66%) was associated with the cells. The data indicate that C. gingivalis regulates its production of hydrolytic enzymes in response to environmental conditions.	0
9666517	Clinical significance of the increased multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene expression in patients with primary breast cancer. The efficacy of cancer treatment is limited by either intrinsic or acquired resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents. To evaluate the clinically important factors related to prognosis in primary breast cancer retrospectively, we investigated the expression of the following genes involving acquirement of drug resistance: multidrug resistance 1 (MDRl), multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), and topoisomerase (Topo) I, II alpha, and II beta. Using an RT-PCR method, we semiquantified the gene expression level in untreated stage II breast cancer tissue (n = 27) and noncancerous breast tissue (n = 10). Among the 27 cancer patients, who were all treated by adjuvant chemoendocrine therapy after surgery, 10 patients showed relapse within the following 10 years whereas 17 patients did not. The gene expression levels of MDRl, MRP, and Topo I, II alpha, and II beta were normalized to the level of the beta 2-microglobulin RT-PCR product. MRP mRNA expression was detected in 70% of the breast cancer tissues and its expression levels were significantly increased in the cancer group compared with the noncancerous breast tissues. Furthermore, the MRP level was much higher in the relapsed patient group. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the MDRl mRNA levels between the noncancerous and cancer groups. Although Topo II alpha mRNA was not detected in noncancerous breast tissues, it was detected in 52% of the breast cancer tissues. In cancer patients, no significant difference in Topo II alpha mRNA levels was observed between the relapsed and nonrelapsed groups. These findings suggest that MRP might be used as one of the markers for poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer.	0
24136364	Impact of myocardial viability assessed by myocardial perfusion imaging on ventricular tachyarrhythmias in cardiac resynchronization therapy. BACKGROUND: The presence of myocardial fibrosis is associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) occurrence irrespective of cardiomyopathy etiology. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of global and regional viability on VTs in patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with advanced heart failure (age 62.3      10.2; 38 men; 24 ischemic etiology) were evaluated using single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging before CRT defibrillator device implantation. Global myocardial viability was determined by the number of viable segments in a 20-segment model. Regional viability was calculated as the mean tracer activity in the corresponding segments at left ventricular (LV) lead position. LV lead segments were determined at implant venography using 2 projections (left anterior oblique 30 and right anterior oblique 30) of coronary sinus tributaries. Patients were followed 30 (24-34) months for the occurrence of VTs. RESULTS: VTs were registered in 18 patients (31.6%). Patients without VTs had significantly more viable segments (17.6      2.35 vs 14.2      4.0; P  =  .002) and higher regional myocardial viability at LV lead position (66.1%      10.3% vs 54.8%      11.4% of tracer activity; P  =  .001) than those with VTs. In multivariate logistic regression models, the number of viable segments (OR  =  0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.85; P  =  .001) and regional viability (OR  =  0.90; 95% CI 0.85-0.97; P  =  .003) were the only independent predictors of VT occurrence. CONCLUSION: Global and regional myocardial viability are independently related to the occurrence of VTs in patients after CRT.	0
17239874	Ultrasound-assisted repair of a unique case of distal vaginal agenesis. OBJECTIVE: To describe a unique vaginal outlet obstruction and its ultrasound-assisted surgical correction. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: An academic medical center. PATIENT(S): A 12-year-old girl was seen with cyclic abdominal pain, nausea, and an abdominal mass. External genital examination revealed no vaginal opening or dimple. Transabdominal ultrasound revealed a large hematometrocolpos 5 cm proximal to the perineum, with an otherwise normal-appearing uterus and ovaries. INTERVENTION(S): Surgical treatment included perineal incision, creation of a 5-cm passage through connective tissue, drainage of the hematometrocolpos, and mobilization of the proximal vagina, allowing for pull-through vaginoplasty. Ultrasound guidance was used throughout the surgery and allowed for a safe transperineal approach. A vaginal form was placed in the neovagina. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Follow-up clinical evaluation and pelvic ultrasonography. RESULT(S): A well-healed perineum and patent 5-cm-long vagina were observed at 4-month follow-up. The patient reported three regular menses. Postoperative pelvic ultrasound scan was normal. CONCLUSION(S): We describe a unique case of isolated distal vaginal agenesis of significant length that was successfully treated via a perineal approach with the intra-operative assistance of ultrasound guidance.	0
10432290	Subclass-specific nuclear localization of a novel CD4 silencer binding factor. The control of CD4 expression is essential for proper T lymphocyte development. We have previously described a cis-acting silencer element required for repressing transcription of the CD4 gene. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel factor that binds to a critical functional site in the CD4 silencer. This factor, referred to as silencer-associated factor (SAF), is a member of the helix-turn-helix factor family and shares sequence similarity with the homeodomain class of transcriptional regulators. Introduction of a specific mutation into the SAF binding site in the CD4 silencer abrogates silencer activity in transgenic mice, supporting the hypothesis that SAF is important in mediating silencer function. Although SAF is expressed in all lymphocytes, immunofluorescence studies indicate that SAF is present primarily in the cytoplasm in T cells in which the endogenous silencer is nonfunctional, whereas it is present primarily in the nucleus in T cells in which the silencer is functional. We thus hypothesize that the subclass-specific subcellular compartmentalization of SAF plays an important role in mediating the specificity of function of the CD4 silencer during T cell development.	0
16881638	A comparative QM/MM simulation study of the reaction mechanisms of human and Plasmodium falciparum HG(X)PRTases. QM/MM hybrid potential free-energy simulations are performed to compare the reaction mechanisms of human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRTase) and the corresponding enyzme from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), hypoxanthine guanine xanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGXPRTase). These enzymes share 44% of sequence identity but display very different affinities for xanthine. The calculations show that in both enzymes phosphoribosyl transfer proceeds via a dissociative mechanism from an anionic form of the substrate. Nevertheless, there are significant differences in the geometries of critical structures along the reaction paths which it may be possible to exploit for the design of specific inhibitors against the Pf enzyme.	0

9069510	Modified low density lipoprotein is a potent stimulus for smooth muscle cell outgrowth from rat aortic explant in vitro. Outgrowth of vascular wall cells from rat aortic tissue explant was studied. In addition to fresh rat serum (3%), the complete culture medium contained either low density lipoprotein (LDL) separated from rat plasma (n-LDL, 100 microg/ml) or rat LDL modified either by activated rat polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmn-LDL) or by exposure to UV light (uv-LDL). Compared to n-LDL, pmn-LDL significantly increased the start of cell outgrowth and the further rate of growth. High concentration of uv-LDL (500 microg/ml) was cytotoxic. Cells which grew out from aortic tissue in the presence of n-LDL were characterised as endothelial cells by staining with lectin Ulex europaeus, with monoclonal antibody to Factor VIII or with monoclonal antibody to endothelial cells (CD31). However, cells which grew out in the presence either of pmn-LDL or uv-LDL did not stain with any of these endothelial cell markers, instead they showed intense staining with monoclonal anti-alpha-smooth muscle actin, indicating that they were smooth muscle cells. Growth rate of subcultured rat aortic smooth muscles cells was increased (P < 0.05) by the presence of uv-LDL (100 microg/ml). It is concluded that LDL modified either by activated leucocytes or by UV light prevents the normal outgrowth of endothelial cells from aortic explant and at the same time greatly promotes outgrowth of smooth muscle cells. Stimulation of both outgrowth of smooth muscle cells from vascular tissue and their proliferation by modified (oxidised) LDL may have important pathological significance in atherogenesis and restenosis.	0
22639368	Strategies for enhancing extracellular secretion of recombinant cyclodextrin glucanotransferase in E. coli. Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is an enzyme that produces cyclodextrins from starch by an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction. Due to the increasing industrial application of cyclodextrins in many fields such as pharmacy, agriculture, biotechnology, food, environment and cosmetics, CGTases have attracted the attention of many scientific researches. Undoubtedly, due to its well-known genetic properties, simplicity and capacity to accommodate many foreign proteins, Escherichia coli remains the most widely used host for recombinant proteins production and thus for CGTases. Like all other proteins, CGTases are originally produced in the cytoplasm, but expressing them out into the periplasm or further to the culture media is preferred due to several advantages such as simplified downstream processing and high expression level which otherwise would be costly, complicated and time consuming. Since E. coli, other than some of its degradative enzymes and toxins, does not normally secrete proteins extracellularly, many strategies have been tried to overcome this drawback using the recombinant technologies. Unfortunately, oversecretion of the recombinant proteins most of the time results in the formation of inactive protein aggregates, called inclusion bodies, which result as a consequence of the burden caused by the methods meant to enhance the secretion. Thus, in this mini-review, the few but most commonly used strategies which offered a solution to the enhancement of extracellular secretion of CGTase in its native state are discussed.	0

19350954	Veteran teachers' use of recommended practices in deaf education. Deaf education teacher preparation programs face the likelihood that their graduates may not implement evidenced-based practices they were taught once they have graduated. The literature suggests that new teachers follow the school culture where they work rather than methods and strategies taught in their preparation programs. To investigate whether teachers of students who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH) implement recommended practices, 23 teachers from three schools for the deaf were interviewed about their implementation and use of two recommended practices: independent reading and problem solving. The guiding questions were: Do teachers of students who are DHH use independent reading and problem solving after the enculturation process? If so, to what level? If not, can a review improve their level of use? Results demonstrated, at least regarding these two practices, that teachers of students who are DHH do implement evidence-based practices in their classrooms.	0
19897940	Identification of mouse 8-cell embryo stage-specific genes by Digital Differential Display. Preimplantation development is critical for successful implantation and pregnancy. In the mouse preimplantation embryo, the first event of morphological and cellular differentiation is established during polarization and compaction at the 8-cell stage. The considerable cell surface and cytoplasmic changes and formation of different populations of cells at the 8-cell stage are fundamentally important for the development of all organisms. To determine genes that are specifically expressed at this crucial stage of embryo development and also to shed light on the different mechanisms that could be of importance during embryo development, we investigated mouse 8-cell and 4-cell embryo stage-specific genes using Digital Differential Display (DDD). The 8-cell stage-specific genes were sorted according to their ontology data from the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), which outlines possible roles for the genes expressed at the 8-cell stage. This study highlights how online tools can be used to identify genes involved in embryo development. Identification of the 8-cell embryo stage-specific genes would open new opportunities for understanding molecular networks during the mid-preimplantation gene activation. Using bioinformatic tools, such as Digital Differential Display and DAVID, it will be possible to identify genes expressed at the 8-cell stage that are likely to be involved in mammalian preimplantation embryo development. Our results may provide a new foundation for molecular control at the onset of embryonic development in mammals, and should be of interest to the scientific community.	0
9314843	Role of angiotensin II in activation of the JAK/STAT pathway induced by acute pressure overload in the rat heart. This study was designed to determine whether the JAK/STAT (indicating just another kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is activated in cardiac hypertrophy induced in vivo by pressure overload in rats and to demonstrate whether angiotensin II is involved in the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Acute pressure overload was produced by constricting the abdominal aorta of Wistar rats. Immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis revealed that pressure overload activated JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 as early as 5 minutes and that STAT1, STAT2, and STAT3 were tyrosine-phosphorylated rapidly after exposure to the pressure overload. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 peaked in the early stage at 5 to 15 minutes, whereas that of STAT3 peaked in the late stage at 60 minutes. Gel mobility shift of the interferon gamma activation site/interferon alpha-stimulating response element was observed immediately after the aortic banding, whereas the band of sis-inducing element was shifted in the late stage at 60 minutes. Both cilazapril (angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor) and E4177 (angiotensin II type 1 [AT1] receptor antagonist) significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of Tyk2 and partially inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2, but neither affected JAK1. Coimmunoprecipitation of the AT1 receptor with JAK2 or Tyk2 was clearly observed at 5 minutes and peaked at 15 minutes (20-fold the control value). These results indicate that the JAK/STAT pathway is activated by acute pressure overload in rats and that angiotensin II is involved in activating Tyk2, and partially activating JAK2, via the AT1 receptor. Both angiotensin II-dependent and -independent pathways take part in activating the JAK/STAT pathway in the pressure-overloaded rat heart.	0
16627181	Effect of light-tip distance on the shear bond strengths of resin-modified glass ionomer cured with high-intensity halogen, light-emitting diode, and plasma arc lights. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of light-tip distance on the shear bond strength and the failure site of brackets cured with 3 light-curing units (high-intensity halogen, light-emitting diode, and plasma arc). METHODS: One hundred thirty-five bovine mandibular permanent incisors were randomly allocated to 9 groups of 15 specimens each. Stainless steel brackets (Victory Series, Unitek/3M, Monrovia, Calif) were bonded with a resin-modified glass-ionomer (Fuji Ortho LC, GC Europe, Leuven, Belgium) to the teeth, and each curing light was tested at 3 distances from the bracket: 0, 3, and 6 mm. After bonding, all samples were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours and subsequently tested for shear bond strength. RESULTS: When the 3 light-curing units were compared at a light-tip distance of 0mm, they showed no significantly different shear bond strengths. At a light-tip distance of 3 mm, no significant differences were found between the halogen and plasma arc lights, but both lights showed significantly higher shear bond strengths than the light-emitting diode light. At a light-tip distance of 6 mm, no significant differences were found between the halogen and light-emitting diode lights, but both showed significantly lower bond strengths than the plasma arc light. When the effect of the light-tip distance on each light-curing unit was evaluated, the halogen and light-emitting diode lights showed no significant differences among the 3 distances. However, the plasma arc light produced significantly higher shear bond strengths at a greater light-tip distance. No significant differences were found among the adhesive remnant index scores of the various groups, except with the LED light at a distance of 3 mm. CONCLUSIONS: In hard-to-reach areas, the plasma arc curing light is suggested for optimal curing efficiency.	0
16901440	Animal models of germinal matrix hemorrhage. Germinal matrix hemorrhage refers to bleeding that arises from the subependymal (or periventricular) germinal region of the immature brain. Clinical studies have shown that infants who experience germinal matrix hemorrhage can develop hydrocephalus or suffer from long-term neurologic dysfunction, including cerebral palsy, seizures, and learning disabilities. Understanding the causative factors and the pathogenesis of subsequent brain damage is important if germinal matrix hemorrhage is to be prevented or treated. Appropriate animal models are necessary to achieve this understanding. A number of animal species, including mice, rats, rabbits, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, and primates, have been used to model germinal matrix hemorrhage. This literature review critically evaluates the animal models of germinal matrix hemorrhage. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages; no single model is suitable for the study of all aspects of brain damage.	0
10100360	Incidence and histological findings of unsuspected prostatic adenocarcinoma in radical cystoprostatectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. OBJECTIVE: The present study is designed to evaluate the incidence, histological features and significance of prostatic adenocarcinoma in patients undergoing cystoprostatectomy for Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder. PATIENTS, MATERIAL AND METHODS: From January 1990 to December 1996, 59 male patients (mean age 66.5 years), with no evidence of prostatic malignancy on preoperative clinical and biochemical assessment, underwent cystoprostatectomy for TCC of the bladder. The bladder was adequately sampled and the entire prostate sectioned at 5-mm intervals and examined histologically, in order to identify unsuspected prostatic cancer (PCa). RESULTS: Sixteen out of 59 patients (27%) were found to have PCa, which was multifocal in 5 cases (31.25%). The mean tumor size was 0.24 cm. The tumors were equally distributed in the anterior and posterior parts of the prostate and in the peripheral and transition zones, with uniform distribution in both prostatic lobes. In 5 patients (31.25%), the single focus of the tumor was in the apex. All were grade I tumors except one, and all were organ-confined with no capsular penetration. The follow-up ranged from 12-74 months (mean 39 months). Within this period, 7 patients died from metastatic bladder cancer. One patient with PCa localized in the prostatic apex had recurrent prostatic disease in the urethro-ileal anastomosis of an orthotopic bladder substitute; he is alive and on androgen deprivation. The remaining patients are relapse-free. CONCLUSIONS: Incidental PCa is quite a common finding in cystoprostatectomy specimens of bladder cancer patients. Its tendency to appear in the apex of the prostate demands careful and complete excision of the organ.	0

Partial-thickness diaphragm biopsies were obtained from 21 subjects going for thoracotomy surgery (FEV(1): 74 +/- 34% predicted; range: 16 to 122% predicted). Cross sections cut from frozen diaphragm were processed with H_E or processed for immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody Ber-MAC3 (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) to label macrophages. Area fractions (A(A)) or the proportions of the cross- sectional area were determined by point counting all viable fields of H_E-stained diaphragm cross sections. A(A) were 66.2 +/- 9.0% for normal muscle, 17.6 +/- 7.2% for abnormal muscle, and 16.3 +/- 4.2% for connective tissue. Percent predicted FEV(1) was inversely related to the A(A) of abnormal muscle (r = -0.53, p < 0.01) and directly related to the A(A) of normal muscle (r = 0.37, p < 0.05). The number of macrophages was not related to % predicted FEV(1) (mean +/- SD: 0.41 +/- 0.18/fiber; 52 +/- 19/mm(2)). We conclude that increasing severity of airflow obstruction is associated with an increased A(A) of abnormal diaphragm and a decreased A(A) of normal diaphragm.	0
17371564	Bone density assessments of oral implant sites using computerized tomography. The type and architecture of bone are considered to affect its load-bearing capacity and it has been indicated that poorer quality bone is associated with higher implant failure rates. To date, bone classifications have only provided subjective methods for pre-operative assessment, which can be considered unreliable. The aim of this study was to evaluate variations of the bone density in designated endosseous implant sites using computerized tomography. One hundred and thirty-one designated implant sites in 72 patients were utilized. Computerized tomography results indicated that bone densities may vary markedly when different areas of a designated implant site are compared. It has been observed that a difference in the bone density exists for the four regions within the oral area, with the anterior mandible yielding mean density values of 944.9+/-207 Hounsfield units (HU)>anterior maxilla, 715.8+/-190 HU>posterior mandible, 674.3+/-227 HU>posterior maxilla and 455.1+/-122 HU. Computerized tomography may be a useful tool for determining the bone density of interest areas before implant placement, and this valuable information about the bone quality provides dental practitioners to make better treatment planning regarding the implant positions.	0
18714221	Relationships between repeated sprint testing, speed, and endurance. Repeated sprint testing is gaining popularity in team sports, but the methods of data analysis and relationships to speed and endurance qualities are not well described. We compared three different methods for analyzing repeated sprint test results, and we quantified relationships between repeated sprints, short sprints, and endurance test scores. Well-trained male junior Australian Football players (n = 60, age 18.1 +/- 0.4 years, height 1.88 +/- 0.07 m, mass 82.0 +/- 8.1 kg; mean +/- SD) completed a 6 x 30-m repeated sprint running test on a 20-second cycle, a 20-m sprint test (short sprint), and the 20-m multistage shuttle run for endurance. Repeated sprint results were evaluated in three ways: total time for all six sprints (TOTAL), percent change from predicted times (PRED) from the fastest 30-m sprint time, and percent change from first to last sprint (CHANGE). We observed a very large decrement (CHANGE 6.3 +/- 0.7%, mean +/- 90% confidence limits) in 30-m performance from the first to last sprint (4.16 +/- 0.10 to 4.42 +/- 0.11 seconds, mean +/- SD). Results from TOTAL were highly correlated with 20-m sprint and 20-m multistage shuttle run tests. Performance decrements calculated by PRED were highly correlated with TOTAL (r = 0.91), but neither method was directly comparable with CHANGE (r = -0.23 and r = 0.12 respectively). TOTAL was moderately correlated with fastest 20-m sprint time (r = 0.66) but not the 20-m multistage shuttle run (r = -0.20). Evaluation of repeated sprint testing is sensitive to the method of data analysis employed. The total sprint time and indices of the relative decrement in performance are not directly interchangeable. Repeated sprint ability seems more related to short sprint qualities than endurance fitness.	0

17059856	Recombinant canarypox virus vaccine co-expressing genes encoding the VP2 and VP5 outer capsid proteins of bluetongue virus induces high level protection in sheep. We describe the development and preliminary characterization of a recombinant canarypox virus vectored vaccine for protective immunization of ruminants against bluetongue virus (BTV) infection. Sheep (n=6) immunized with recombinant canarypox virus vector (BTV-CP) co-expressing synthetic genes encoding the two outer capsid proteins (VP2 and VP5) of BTV serotype 17 (BTV-17) developed high titers (40-160) of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and were resistant to challenge with a field strain of BTV-17. In contrast, sheep (n=5) immunized with a commercial recombinant canarypox virus vector expressing the E and preM genes of West Nile virus were seronegative to BTV and developed pyrexia, lymphopenia, and extended, high-titered viremias following challenge exposure to the field strain of BTV-17. These data confirm that the BTV-CP vaccine may be useful for the protective immunization of ruminants against bluetongue, and it may avoid the problems inherent to live-attenuated (LA) BTV vaccines.	0

12470425	Antitumor and anticytopenic effects of aqueous extracts of propolis in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Using an ICR mouse model bearing a syngeneic Ehrlich ascitis carcinoma, the present study was undertaken to examine the effects of crude, water-soluble propolis (CWSP) on tumor progression, chemotherapeutic efficacy, and hematopoiesis in the peripheral blood. It was demonstrated that CWSP, administered subcutaneously, resulted in marked regression of tumor growth in mice, at the early phase after tumor inoculation (CWSP, p < 0.05 vs. saline control). Molecular analysis indicated that the CWSP is composed of 8.4% protein, 4.2% quercetin plus a variety of saccharides with a molecular weight of 29 kDa. Orally administered CWSP did not produce any regression for the observation period (oral CWSP, p > 0.05 vs. saline control). Peritoneal injection of CWSP into neonatal mice resulted in an increased lymphocyte/polymorphonuclear leukocyte ratio activity, indicating the potential activation of lymphoid cell lineages. These observations suggest that subcutaneously injected CWSP could regulate the development of tumors by possibly stimulating multicellular immunity. In addition, oral administration of CWSP concurrently with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or mitomycin C (MMC), significantly increased tumor regression as compared with the respective chemotherapy alone, illustrating the adjuvant effect of orally administered CWSP for tumor regression when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. To examine further the potential usefulness of CWSP for chemotherapeutic regimens, which induce profound multilineage hematopoietic suppression, mice that received CWSP orally in addition to a 5-FU or MMC were followed for absolute numbers of platelets and white and red blood cells. The oral administration of CWSP significantly ameliorated the cytopenia induced by 5-FU, resulting in recovery of white as well as red blood cell counts (5-FU plus CWSP, p < 0.05 vs. 5-FU alone or water control; white blood cells on day 15, red blood cells on day 25), but no marked effects on platelet counts was observed (5-FU plus CWSP, p > 0.05 vs. 5-FU alone or water control). On the other hand, CWSP significantly reduced all three MMC-induced cytopenias, especially at the later stage of the chemotherapeutic course (after day 30), suggesting repetitive requirements of oral administration of CWSP. In summary, subcutaneous administration of an aqueous CWSP resulted in marked regression of transplanted tumors. Orally administered CWSP combined with chemotherapeutic agents significantly increased tumor regression and ameliorated the cytopenia induced by the chemotherapeutic agents alone. These results suggest the benefits of potential clinical trials using CWSP combined with chemotherapeutic agents in order to maximize enhanced immunity while potentially minimizing postchemotherapeutic deteriorated reactions.	0

9324482	[Extracorporeal shockwave therapy in orthopedics. Positive results in tennis elbow and tendinosis calcarea of the shoulder]. Since the beginning of the 1990s scientific investigations on the use of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in the field of orthopedics have been carried out at the Orthopedic Department of the University of Mainz. Prospective studies demonstrated beneficial effects in chronic lateral humeral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), and in calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder in more than 50% of the cases. Additional indications for which positive results of prospective studies have been published during the past 2 years are plantar calcaneodynea and pseudoarthrosis. On the basis of the results achieved, it may be concluded that, for specific indications, extracorporeal shock wave therapy may now be taken out of the clinical testing stage and introduced into routine practice.	0
17077895	Photochemical synthesis of benzoyl spiro[2.2]pentanes. In the present study, we describe the photochemical behaviour of 2-mesyloxy phenyl ketones 8 and 12 bearing a cyclopropane moiety in the side-chain. Irradiation of 8 and 12 leads to the corresponding benzoyl spiro[2.2]pentanes as a consequence of an initial gamma-H-shift, subsequent elimination of MsOH (accompanied by a spin-center shift) and cyclization of the resulting 1,3-diradicals. In contrast, a corresponding phenyl ketone without a mesyloxy group in the 2-position, and thus a potential reactant of the \"classical\" Norrish-Yang reaction, shows no photochemical reaction. By means of quantum chemical calculations we discovered that in the presence of a mesyloxy group the activation barrier for the photochemical gamma-H-shift is substantially decreased. Furthermore, a photoinduced skeletal rearrangement of benzoyl spiro[2.2]pentane to 2-cyclobutylidene-acetophenone could be observed. Compared to the common methods used to synthesize spiro[2.2]pentanes, the photochemical preparation of benzoyl spiro[2.2]pentane presented herein is the first example where a bond between the spiro atom and an adjacent atom is formed.	0

16006751	Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist inhibits the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in colorectal carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL)-1 is known to act as a tumor growth factor by inducing angiogenic factors. We examined the significance of IL-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) for inducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in colorectal cancers. METHODS: We investigated the expression of VEGF induced by IL-1beta in five colon cancer cell lines and the possible involvement of IL-1 RA. We also measured the tissue concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-1 RA and VEGF by ELISA in 65 colorectal cancer patients. RESULTS: IL-1beta induced VEGF secretion with a 19-fold increase in Caco-2 cells. A significant increase in VEGF secretion was also observed in SW480 and WiDr cells. IL-1 RA inhibited IL-1beta-induced VEGF secretion by 87%. Our data from the clinically obtained specimens showed that the IL-1 RA/IL-1beta ratio is significantly lower in cancer tissue. Regarding the clinicopathological parameters, the IL-1 RA/IL-1beta ratio was significantly lower in patients with vessel involvement than in those without involvement, and IL-1 RA/IL-1beta ratio was negatively correlated with the VEGF protein level in colorectal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that IL-1beta induces VEGF expression and IL-1 RA acts as the competitive inhibitor, and that the IL-1 RA/IL-1beta ratio is significant for VEGF expression in the microenvironment of colorectal cancer tissue. We conclude that IL-1beta induces VEGF secretion in a certain population of colorectal cancer patients, and that IL-1 RA is the potential therapeutic agent for antiangiogenic therapy in colorectal cancer patients.	0
23511701	Concomitant increase in muscle strength and bone mineral density with decreasing IL-6 levels after combination therapy with alendronate and calcitriol in postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to assess changes in muscle mass and strength according to changes in bone mineral density (BMD) after alendronate-calcitriol therapy and to assess subsequent changes in common biomarkers for osteoporosis and sarcopenia to establish a common strategy against these coexisting conditions. METHODS: Thirty-eight women with osteopenia and without conditions affecting calcium metabolism, inflammatory cytokines, acute and chronic medical conditions, and regular endurance exercise completed the study. Appendicular lean mass and BMD were measured, and relative skeletal mass index was determined. Grip strength was measured with a JAMAR hand dynamometer. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), protein carbonyl, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured as biomarkers related to bone and muscle mass before and after a 6-month combination therapy with alendronate (5 mg) and calcitriol (0.5  g). RESULTS: Baseline serum IL-6 showed significant negative correlations with lumbar BMD and handgrip strength (r = -0.458, P = 0.01, and left hand; r = -0.387, P = 0.03, respectively), whereas serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level was 13.97 (5.65) ng/mL, compatible with vitamin D insufficiency and inversely correlated with PTH level (r = -0.481, P = 0.005). The observation of secondary hyperparathyroidism in association with 25-hydroxy vitamin D deficiency was absent, in contrast with previous reports. After treatment, the mean IL-6 level decreased by 56.5% (8.9%) (P = 0.0032), lumbar BMD increased by 2.62% (2.87%; P = 0.0002), and average handgrip strength increased by 33.52% (8.34%; P = 0.0001). Posttherapy IL-6 level was not significantly correlated with posttherapy BMD and handgrip strength (r = 0.06, P = 0.76, and r = 0.156, P = 0.45, respectively). However, the degree of IL-6 changed by treatment displayed a significant negative correlation with initial lumbar BMD and a positive correlation with PTH levels. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement not only in lumbar BMD but also in handgrip strength (a representative parameter for sarcopenia) has been observed with 6 months of alendronate-calcitriol combination therapy. Initial IL-6 levels display an inverse relationship with pretreatment lumbar BMD and handgrip strength. The degree of change in IL-6 levels induced by the combination therapy is correlated with the initial degree of the catabolic status of the bone, indicated by markers such as PTH and the severity of lumbar BMD derangements.	0
17176868	[Simultaneous renal cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma in ipsilateral kidney, report of two cases]. Two cases of simultaneously developed renal tumors (renal cell carcinoma and renal pelvic urothelial carcinoma) in the ipsilateral kidney are reported. These underwent radical surgery under the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma or renal pelvic urothelial carcinoma, respectively. The risk of incorrect preoperative diagnosis is discussed in terms of insufficient surgical margins. The liberal use of frozen section diagnosis and more radical resection if applicable may be the key to solve such dilemmas.	0
20645815	Amelioration of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by extracts of Hemidesmus indicus and Acorus calamus. Administration of commonly used anticancer drug cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)] at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (12 mg/kg body weight) resulted in severe renal toxicity as evidenced from histopathological observations and biochemical alterations in the renal tissue. The extracts of medicinal plants Hemidesmus indicus L. (Apocynaceae) and Acorus calamus L. (Araceae) protected the renal tissue effectively from cisplatin-induced toxicity. Treatment of cisplatin-administered animals with the plant extracts could prevent the drug-induced oxidative damage in the renal tissue as evidenced from the decreased levels of lipid peroxidation and enhanced activities of the antioxidants in the renal tissue. Cisplatin treatment increased serum urea level to 41.3 +/- 2.86 mg/dL and administration of the extracts of H. indicus and A. calamus brought down the level to 34.54 +/- 0.37 and 30.12 +/- 0.95 mg/dL, respectively. Serum creatinine levels were increased to 1.1 +/- 0.02 mg/dL following cisplatin administration, and treatment with extracts of H. indicus and A. calamus brought this down to 0.76 +/- 0.09 and 0.61 +/- 0.06 mg/dL, respectively. The histopathological observations indicated that treatment with the H. indicus and A. calamus extracts restored the cisplatin-induced structural alterations in the renal tissue.	0
11944095	Pulmonary gas exchange during apnoea in exercising men. There is indirect evidence that cardiovascular responses to apnoea result in a temporary slowing of the O(2) uptake in the lungs in exercising humans. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to determine directly to what extent this occurs, and whether the magnitude of this slowing is such that it must be the result of concomitant cardiovascular readjustments and not merely a result of an isolated apnoea-induced fall in the arterial O(2) saturation ( S(a)O(2)). Eight men performed 120 W leg exercise and performed repeated apnoeas of 10-40 s duration. Heart rate, S(a)O(2), and breath-by-breath gas exchange were determined. Pulmonary O(2) uptake fell gradually as breath-holds proceeded by [mean (SEM)] 74 (3)% of the pre-apnoea O(2) uptake. This decrease was significantly larger than could be accounted for by the fall in S(a)O(2) alone [ S(a)O(2) fall -30 (3)%], which it is estimated would have resulted in a fall of pulmonary O(2) uptake of -54 (5)%. We conclude that cardiovascular responses to apnoea contribute significantly to reducing pulmonary O(2) uptake during apnoea in exercising men.	0

20015752	Malleus handle: determinant of success in ossiculoplasty. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic factors affecting outcome in ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This study is a retrospective case series of electronic database at an academic institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 209 cases of chronic supportive otitis media performed from January 2000 through December 2007 and collected demographic, clinical, audiologic, and outcome information. Univariate analyses of group differences in terms of postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) changes were evaluated by analysis of variance. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between postoperative ABG and the independent variables. RESULTS: There were 105 cases of OCR the met the inclusion criteria (44 primary and 61 revision tympanoplasties), with an average follow-up of 19 months. The diagnoses were chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma in 36 cases and cholesteatoma in 69 cases. The mean preoperative ABG was 34 +/- 15 dB, and the mean postoperative ABG was 20 +/- 14 dB (P < 0.001). Of the independent variables analyzed, the type of procedure (ie, OCR performed during second-look tympanoplasty vs canal wall up vs canal wall down), preoperative ABG, and status of malleus handle were predictive of the success of OCR. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable prognostic factors in OCR include smaller preoperative ABG and the presence of an intact malleus handle.	0

11397712	Effect of immune deficiency on lipoproteins and atherosclerosis in male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. To determine whether T cells and B cells influence lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, we crossed apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE degrees ) mice with recombination activating gene 2-deficient (RAG2 degrees ) mice. Total plasma cholesterol levels were approximately 20% higher in male apoE degrees mice compared with the apoE degrees RAG2 degrees mice at 8 weeks of age, and plasma triglyceride levels were 2.5-fold higher in the apoE degrees mice even when plasma cholesterol levels were similar. Male mice with plasma cholesterol levels between 400 and 600 mg/dL at 8 weeks of age were euthanized at 27 and 40 weeks of age. The aortic root lesion area in the apoE degrees RAG2 degrees mice, compared with that in the immune-competent apoE degrees mice, was 81% and 57% smaller at 27 and 40 weeks of age, respectively. In contrast, there was no difference in the size of the brachiocephalic trunk lesions. Similar results were obtained with mice euthanized at 40 weeks of age that had 8-week cholesterol levels between 300 and 399 mg/dL. In apoE degrees RAG2 degrees mice, aortic root atherosclerosis was more profoundly suppressed at lower cholesterol levels. Thus, T and B cells and their products differentially influence the development of atherosclerosis at different sites. We also demonstrate a profound effect of the immune system on plasma lipid homeostasis.	0
10400990	An L1 element intronic insertion in the black-eyed white (Mitf[mi-bw]) gene: the loss of a single Mitf isoform responsible for the pigmentary defect and inner ear deafness. Waardenburg syndrome type 2 (WS2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a combination of pigmentary and auditory abnormalities. Approximately 20% of WS2 cases are associated with mutations in the gene encoding microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). MITF plays a critical role in the development of both neural-crest-derived melanocytes and optic cup-derived retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE); the loss of a functional Mitf in mice results in complete absence of all pigment cells, which in turn induces microphthalmia and inner ear deafness. The black-eyed white Mitf mi-bw homozygous mouse normally has a pigmented RPE but lacks melanocytes essential for the pigmentation of the body and hearing. We show here that Mitf mi-bw is caused by an insertion into intron 3 of a 7.2 kb novel L1 element, L1bw, which belongs to an actively retrotransposing TF subfamily. The L1bw insertion reduces the amount of mRNAs for two Mitf isoforms, Mitf-A and Mitf-H, by affecting their overall expression levels and pre-mRNA splicing patterns, while it abolishes mRNA expression of another isoform, Mitf-M, which is specifically expressed in neural-crest-derived melanocytes. The consequence of the L1 insertion in the black-eyed white Mitf mi-bw mouse is that the developmental programme for RPE cells proceeds normally, most likely because of the presence of residual, full-length Mitf-A and Mitf-H proteins, whereas the lack of Mitf-M results in loss of the melanocyte population. The results suggest that melanocyte development depends critically on a single Mitf isoform, Mitf-M, and raise the possibility that specific mutations affecting MITF-M, the human equivalent of Mitf-M, may be responsible for a subset of WS2 conditions.	0

22048155	Kidins220/ARMS mediates the integration of the neurotrophin and VEGF pathways in the vascular and nervous systems. Signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases controls cell differentiation and survival. How signals from different receptors are integrated is, however, still poorly understood. In this work, we have identified Kidins220 (Kinase D interacting substrate of 220 kDa)/ARMS (Ankyrin repeat-rich membrane spanning) as a main player in the modulation of neurotrophin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in vivo, and a primary determinant for neuronal and cardiovascular development. Kidins220(-/-) embryos die at late stages of gestation, and show extensive cell death in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Primary neurons from Kidins220(-/-) mice exhibit reduced responsiveness to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, in terms of activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, neurite outgrowth and potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic currents. In addition, mice lacking Kidins220 display striking cardiovascular abnormalities, possibly due to impaired VEGF signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that Kidins220 constitutively interacts with VEGFR2. These findings, together with the data presented in the accompanying paper, indicate that Kidins220 mediates the integration of several growth factor receptor pathways during development, and mediates the activation of distinct downstream cascades according to the location and timing of stimulation.	0
11252475	Microbiological sampling of meat cuts and manufacturing beef by excision or swabbing. Groups of 25 beef or pork loin primal cuts or of pieces of stored or not stored manufacturing beef were sampled by excision and by swabbing with cotton wool, sponge, and gauze. Total aerobic counts, coliforms, and Escherichia coli from each sample were enumerated. Values for the mean log10, log10 mean, and/or the log10 total numbers recovered were calculated for each set of 25 bacterial counts. Those statistics indicated that, for product sampled without storage, swabbing with cotton wool or sponge recovered about 30%, and swabbing with gauze recovered about 10% of the bacteria recovered by excision sampling; but that for product sampled after storage, swabbing with cotton wool or sponge recovered about 50% and swabbing with gauze recovered about 15% of the bacteria recovered by excision sampling. However, the incidences of samples positive for coliforms and E. coli were less for stored than for nonstored product with all methods of sampling. The findings indicate that the conditions of meat surfaces, the handling of product, and the state of the microflora might all affect the numbers of bacteria recovered by any sampling technique. Thus, the relationship between the numbers recovered by excision or any selected swabbing technique may differ for different types of noncomminuted, raw meat product.	0
9594509	[A case of mediastinal neurilemmoma originating from the intrathoracic vagal nerve]. A case of mediastinal neurilemmoma originating from the left intrathoracic vagal nerve was reported. A 42-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of evaluation of an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray. Both CT and MRI showed that the tumor was located in middle mediastinum between the aortic arch and the left pulmonary artery, and the diagnosis was suspected to be neurilemmoma originating from the intrathoracic vagal nerve. Left standard thoracotomy was performed and the tumor was resected by amputating the vagal trunk. Pathological diagnosis was benign Antoni A and B type neurilemmoma. The postoperative course was uneventful with transient hoarseness. The patient is doing well with no relapse at 4 years 6 months after the operation. Mediastinal neurilemmoma originating from the vagal nerve is rare and we discussed both the diagnosis and the surgical treatment for this disease.	0
14714221	Intermittent pneumatic compression is effective in preventing symptomatic pulmonary embolism after thoracic surgery. PURPOSE: Postoperative pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a fatal complication even in thoracic surgery. We have used intermittent pneumatic compression for the prophylaxis of postoperative PE since 1998, and herein examined its effectiveness. METHODS: Seven hundred and six patients, whose medical records showed use/no use of pneumatic compression for prophylaxis of PE, underwent general thoracic surgery in our department from December 1995 to December 2000. Their clinical records were reviewed, and variables were compared between patients who experienced clinically apparent PE and patients who did not have PE. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-four patients did not receive any prophylactic treatment, and 7 of these (2.0%) experienced postoperative PE. Three hundred and sixty-two patients received prophylactic pneumatic compression and none of these developed PE. There was a statistical correlation between the occurrence of PE and the application of pneumatic compression (Chi(2)-test, P = 0.006). Six of the seven patients with PE were operated on in the right decubitus position, and the operative position and the prevalence of PE was also significantly correlated (Chi(2)-test, P = 0.024). Other factors, such as age, sex, operative time, duration until patients became fully ambulatory, body mass index, and character of the disease, did not have significant correlation with the occurrence of PE. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumatic compression was found to effectively prevent postoperative PE. The right decubitus position is considered to be a risk factor for the development of postoperative PE in thoracic surgery.	0
21185869	Strand-specific real-time RT-PCR for distinguishing influenza vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA. Real-time RT-PCR is used to quantify individual influenza viral RNAs. However, conventional real-time RT-PCR, using strand-specific primers, has been shown to produce not only the anticipated strand-specific products, but also substantial amounts of non-strand-specific products, indicating lack of specificity. Therefore, in this study, a novel strand-specific real-time RT-PCR method was established to quantify the three types of influenza viral RNA (vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA) separately. This method is based on reverse transcription using tagged primers to add a 'tag' sequence at the 5' end and the hot-start method. Real-time PCR using the 'tag' portion as the forward primer and a segment-specific reverse primer ensured the specificity for quantifying the three types of RNA. Using this method, specific target RNA was detected at 100-100,000-folds higher level than other types of RNA. This method was also used to evaluate the vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA levels of segments 5 and 6 in MDCK cells infected with influenza A virus at different time point post-infections. The cRNA level was 1/10 to 1/100 lower than that of the vRNA and mRNA. Moreover, different dynamics of vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA synthesis were observed; the copy number of the vRNA gradually increased throughout the infection, the cRNA increased and then plateaued, while the mRNA increased and then decreased. This novel method thus provides data critical for understanding the influenza virus life cycle, including transcription, replication, and genome incorporation into virions.	0

8514401	Effects of strain variation, serotype, and structural modification on kinetics for activation and binding of C3 to Cryptococcus neoformans. Incubation of encapsulated cells of Cryptococcus neoformans in normal human serum leads to activation of the alternative complement pathway and deposition of opsonic fragments of C3 into the capsule. We determined whether the variation in capsular structure that occurs among the four major cryptococcal serotypes was reflected in the kinetics for activation and binding of C3. We also examined the effects on activation kinetics of de-O-acetylation or periodate oxidation of the capsule. Binding kinetics were characterized in terms of the time required to deposit 5% of the maximal amount of C3 on the yeast (t5%), the first-order rate constant for amplification of C3 deposition (k'), and the maximum amount of C3 that could be deposited in the capsule (C3max). Our results showed that variations in the capsular structure that characterized each serotype had no significant influence on C3max but that the rate of C3 deposition depended significantly on the serotype. C3 accumulated at a higher rate on cells of serotypes A and D than on cells of serotypes B and C. There was a significant correlation between capsular volume and C3max, although the relationship was not linear. Periodate treatment of encapsulated cryptococci of all four serotypes led to decapsulation. Periodate-oxidized encapsulated cells displayed kinetics for activation and binding of C3 that were identical to kinetics observed with nonencapsulated cryptococci.

23128664	Site-specific differential effects of once-yearly zoledronic acid on the hip assessed with quantitative computed tomography: results from the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial. We used new approaches to the analysis of diagnostic scans to detect changes in bone density in different regions of the hip after 3  years of treatment with the zoledronic acid. We showed that the drug significantly increases hip bone density compared to placebo at regions where hip fractures usually occur. INTRODUCTION: This study aims to identify whether treatment with zoledronic acid exerts site-specific differential effects on volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at the hip. METHODS: We analysed quantitative computed tomography scans of the hip obtained at baseline and 36  months in 179 women participating in the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial. Cortical, trabecular and integral BMDs were determined at three main regions of interest-the femoral neck (FN), trochanter (TR) and total hip (TH)-and several sub-regions of interest, namely the proximal, middle, distal, anterior, posterior, inferomedial and superolateral FN, and the middle and distal TR. RESULTS: Volumetric BMD increased significantly (p   <   0.05) from baseline with zoledronic acid compared to placebo. Trabecular vBMD increased as follows: FN, 5.4  %; FN sub-regions, 6.0  % (proximal), 4.4  % (middle), 5.6  % (distal), 7.5  % (anterior), 7.0  % (superolateral) and 5.4  % (posterior); TR, 6.5  % and TH, 5.7  %. Cortical vBMD increased as follows: FN sub-regions, 5.0  % (proximal FN) and 2.3  % (anterior); TR, 4.6  %; middle TR, 2.7  % and TH, 3.8  %. CONCLUSIONS: The effects on vBMD of annual infusion of 5  mg of zoledronic acid are site-specific and dominated by trabecular changes.	0

14969847	Effect of Maotai liquor on the liver: an experimental study. BACKGROUND: Epidemiology investigation showed that no worker drunk Maotai liquor for nearly 30 years died of hepatic diseases, and no obvious hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis were found in 99 workers who had drunk Maotai liquor for a long period by epidemiology investigation and needle biopsy. The same finding was detected in rats that were drunk by Maotai liquor continued for 56 days. This study was to investigate the effects of Maotai liquor on the liver and its mechanism of preventing hepatic fibrosis. METHODS: After ingestion of Maotai for 56 consecutive days, male SD rats were killed for detecting the levels of metallothionein and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissues. Rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and human HSCs were cultured in vitro to observe the effect of Maotai on HSCs proliferation and collagen synthesis. After ingestion of Maotai for 14 consecutive weeks, the livers of male SD rats were harvested for pathohistological examination. RESULTS: The level of metallothionein in the liver of Maotai-induced rats increased by 22 folds, whereas the levels of hepatic lipid peroxide and MDA was decreased significantly (P<0.05) in Maotai-induced animals suffering from CCl4. Maotai demonstrated obvious inhibitory effect on proliferation of HSCs and the inhibition was concentration-dependent. Gene expression and protein secretion of collagens could also be inhibited by Maotai. In alcoholic group, typical liver cirrhosis was observed. In Maotai group, however, though fatty degeneration of hepatocytes and mild fibrosis of the interstitium were observed, no obvious hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis were found. CONCLUSION: It might be an important mechanism of interfering the progress of hepatic fibrosis that Maotai increases the level of metallothionein in the liver and inhibits the activation of HSCs and the synthesis of collagen proteins.	0
24376367	The Role of Mass Spectrometry in the \"Omics\" Era. Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical technology on which the emerging ''-omics'' approaches are based. It may provide detection and quantization of thousands of proteins and biologically active metabolites from a tissue, body fluid or cell culture working in a ''global'' or ''targeted'' manner, down to ultra-trace levels. It can be expected that the high performance of MS technology, coupled to routine data handling, will soon bring fruit in the request for a better understanding of human diseases, leading to new molecular biomarkers, hence affecting drug targets and therapies. In this review, we focus on the main advances in the MS technologies, influencing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics fields, up to the most recent MS applications to meta-omic studies.	0

19882538	Risk factors for culture-positive endophthalmitis after repair of open globe injuries. PURPOSE: To identify risk factors for the development of culture-positive endophthalmitis after repair of open globe injuries. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 629 consecutive patients with open globe injuries admitted to King Abdulaziz University Hospital between May 1996 and January 2008. RESULTS: Endophthalmitis developed in 12 (1.9%) patients. The following factors were significantly associated with endophthalmitis by univariate analysis: delayed presentation (>24 hours) (p=0.008), rural address (p=0.013), and dirty wound (p=0.012). Logistic regression analysis identified dirty wound to be associated with the development of endophthalmitis (odds ratio = 11.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.67-50.6). On logistic regression analysis, presence of retained intraocular foreign body (IOFB) in association with rural address (odds ratio = 11.0; 95% CI = 1.44-83.3) or dirty wound (odds ratio = 9.2; 95% CI = 1.22-69.1) was associated with development of endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis was a significant negative predictor for final good visual outcome (p=0.00261) and was significantly associated with hypotony (p=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed presentation, rural address, and dirty wound were associated with development of endophthalmitis. Retained IOFB in association with rural address or dirty wound was associated with a particularly high risk of endophthalmitis.	0
17194869	Exposure to lead and length of time needed to make homes lead-safe for young children. OBJECTIVES: We determined the length of time needed to make homes lead-safe in a population of children aged 0 to 6 years with blood lead levels (BLLs) of 20 micrograms per deciliter (mug/dL) or greater. Reducing this time would reduce children's exposure to lead. METHODS: Data came from the Wisconsin Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program's comprehensive blood lead surveillance system. Analysis was restricted to children whose first BLL test value during 1996-1999 was between 20 and 40 mug/dL and for whom housing intervention data were available (n=382). RESULTS: The median length of time required to make a home lead-safe was 465 days. Only 18% of children lived in homes that were made lead-safe within 6 months; 45% lived in homes requiring more than 18 months to be lead-safe. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts are needed to reduce the time it takes to make a home lead-safe. Although abatement orders always include time limits, improved compliance with the orders must be enforced. Greater emphasis should be placed on securing lead-safe or lead-free housing for families, thus reducing lead exposure.	0
22422614	Association of metals and proteasome activity in erythrocytes of prostate cancer patients and controls. Information is lacking on the effects toxic environmental metals may have on the 26S proteasome. The proteasome is a primary vehicle for selective degradation of damaged proteins in a cell and due to its role in cell proliferation, inhibition of the proteasome has become a target for cancer therapy. Metals are essential to the proteasome's normal function and have been used within proteasome-inhibiting complexes for cancer therapy. This study evaluated the association of erythrocyte metal levels and proteasome chymotrypsin-like (CT-like) activity in age- and race-matched prostate cancer cases (n=61) and controls (n=61). Erythrocyte metals were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). CT-like activity was measured by proteasome activity assay using a fluorogenic peptide substrate. Among cases, significant correlations between individual toxic metals were observed (r(arsenic-cadmium)=0.49, p<0.001; r(arsenic-lead)=0.26, p=0.04, r(cadmium-lead) 0.53, p<0.001), but there were no significant associations between metals and CT-like activity. In contrast, within controls there were no significant associations between metals, however, copper and lead levels were significantly associated with CT-like activity. The associations between copper and lead and proteasome activity (r(copper-CT-like)=-0.28, p=0.002 ; r(lead-CT-like)=0.23, p=0.011) remained significant in multivariable models that included all of the metals. These findings suggest that biologically essential metals and toxic metals may affect proteasome activity in healthy controls and, further, show that prostate cancer cases and controls differ in associations between metals and proteasome activity in erythrocytes. More research on toxic metals and the proteasome in prostate cancer is warranted.	0
10811077	Prevalence of serologic evidence of cat scratch disease in patients with neuroretinitis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Bartonella henselae seropositivity in patients with a clinical diagnosis of neuroretinitis. DESIGN: Retrospective, clinic-based, cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen consecutive patients seeking treatment at the Casey Eye Institute from November 1993 through November 1998 who had neuroretinitis. METHODS: The billing and photographic records of the Casey Eye Institute were searched for patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of neuroretinitis or Leber's idiopathic stellate neuroretinitis. Charts were then reviewed to determine the results of B. henselae antibody titers and other pertinent clinical information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of B. henselae serologic testing. RESULTS: Fourteen of 18 patients with neuroretinitis had serologic studies. Nine of the 14 tested patients (64.3%) were found to have elevated IgM or IgG for B. henselae, suggesting current or past infection. Patients with positive serologic analysis results tended to have worse vision at presentation. There were no other obvious differences between seropositive and seronegative groups in this study, including duration or quality of recovery. CONCLUSIONS: At our tertiary care ophthalmology institution, most tested patients with neuroretinitis had evidence of past or present cat-scratch disease based on positive serologic analysis for B. henselae, a much greater prevalence than is expected to be found in the general population or in patients with idiopathic uveitis. Further study is indicated to clarify the prevalence of cat-scratch disease in neuroretinitis and the role and efficacy of antibiotics in treatment.	0
7196670	Reduction of main line C. Fifteen hundred palmar prints of normal persons and patients suffering from various diseases were studied and classified as to dermal ridge configurations at the base of digit IV, after the exclusion of main line C courses with endings at one of the palmar marginal regions. This classification scheme, based on the three classical reduction forms of line C (O,X(8),x), resulted in the differentiation of three main groups, A, B, and C. Within these main groups, pattern types with strong similarity were combined to subgroups allowing an easier documentation. Twin and family data were used to test whether the described pattern types, besides the classical abortive states O,X and x of line C (called special and intermediate forms), are heritable and for which of them a remarkable reduction tendency could be established. The results allow us to confirm the main grouping and the assumed reduction tendency of the special forms of group A.	0
23416292	Simultaneous quantification of 22R and 22S epimers of budesonide in human plasma by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry: application in a stereoselective pharmacokinetic study. Budesonide (BUD) is used as a mixture of 22R and 22S epimers for the topical treatment of asthma, rhinitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. To study stereoselectivity in the pharmacokinetics of each epimer, we developed a stereoselective and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitative determination of 22R and 22S epimers of BUD in human plasma. The epimers of BUD were extracted from plasma using n-hexane/dichloromethane/isopropanol (2:1:0.1, v/v/v) under alkaline conditions. Baseline separation was obtained within 7min on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 (50mm 2.1mm, 1.7 m) column using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile/5mM ammonium acetate/acetic acid (29:71:0.142, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.7mL/min. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in a multiple reaction monitoring mode using the m/z 489 > 357 transition for BUD epimers and the m/z 497 > 357 transition for the internal standard d8-BUD epimers. Calibration curves were linear over the concentration ranges of 5.0-500 and 5.0-3000pg/mL for 22R-BUD and 22S-BUD, respectively. The lower limit of quantification was 5.0pg/mL for both epimers. The method was successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study of BUD controlled-release capsules in humans. Consistent differences in the pharmacokinetics of the 22R and 22S epimers were observed, the AUC(0-   ) of 22S-BUD was approximately six times higher than that of 22R-BUD, and the 22S-/22R-BUD ratio of total body clearance was 0.17.	0

8166967	Swainsonine augments the cytotoxicity of human lymphokine-activated killer cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells. OBJECTIVE: Swainsonine (SW), an inhibitor of mammalian Golgi alpha-mannosidase II, blocks the processing of high mannose to complex type oligosaccharides. In this study, the effect of SW on the cytotoxicity of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells against autologous thyroid cancer was investigated. DESIGN: Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with thyroid cancer were incubated with recombinant interleukin 2 (100 U/mL) and 0.5 mg/L of SW for 7 days, and thyroid cancer cells obtained from surgical specimens were pretreated with SW (0.5 mg/L) for 18 hours. The cytotoxicity of SW-treated LAK cells against tumor cells tested in a standard 4-hour radioactive chromium Cr 51 release assay. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of SW-treated LAK cells against autologous thyroid cancer cells was found to be significantly greater than that of standard LAK cells incubated with interleukin 2 alone. The N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester esterase activity of LAK cells, this activity being a cytotoxic factor that is necessary for the lethal hit stage, was also increased by SW treatment. Further, thyroid cancer cells incubated with SW, as compared with nontreated tumor cells, showed much higher susceptibility to LAK killing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SW might have potential immunomodulatory properties in the treatment of thyroid cancer.	0

14744824	Frailty modelling of testicular cancer incidence using Scandinavian data. The incidence of testicular cancer is highest among young men, and then decreases sharply with age. This points towards a frailty effect, where some men have a much greater risk of testicular cancer than the majority of the male population. Those with the highest risk get cancer, drain the group of individuals at risk, and leave a healthy male population which has approximately zero risk of testicular cancer. This leads to the observed decrease in incidence. We discuss a frailty model, where the frailty is compound-Poisson-distributed. This allows for a non-susceptible group (of zero frailty). The model is successfully applied to incidence data from the Danish and Norwegian registries. It is indicated that there was a decrease in incidence for males born during World War II in both countries. Bootstrap analysis is used to find the degree of variation in the estimates. In the Armitage-Doll multistage model, the estimated number of transitions needed for a cell to become malignant is close to 3 for non-seminomas and 4 for seminomas in both the Danish and Norwegian data. This paper demonstrates that a model including a frailty effect fits the incidence data well and gives interesting results and interpretations, although this is no proof of the effect's truth.	0

23320882	Associative learning measured with ERP predicts deferred imitation using a strict observation only design in 14 to 15 month old children. Deferred imitation (DI) is an established procedure for behavioral measurement of early declarative-like memories in infancy and previous work has indicated a link between this type of memory and brain potentials in infants. The present study compared infants' memory performance in this paradigm with electrophysiological indices of associative learning. Thirty children (M = 14.5 months) participated, of which 15 (8 boys) had acceptable event-related potentials (ERP) recordings that could be included in the final analysis. Deferred imitation was measured with an observation-only procedure using three actions and a 30 min delay. ERP was recorded with a high-density electrode net (128 electrodes) during associative learning. Change scores based on Nc, a middle latency component associated with attentional processes, predicted deferred imitation performance. Thus, associative learning measured with ERP predicts deferred imitation using a strict observation only design in 14 to 15 month old children.	0
6588209	Is it time for CONFER, a computer-based conference for dental public health? The usual methods of information exchange within a specialty, such as journals and newsletters, have deficiencies in terms of speed. Adjuncts to them such as the telephone, traditional correspondence, and meetings have other problems with coverage and cost. Advances in computing and telecommunications provide an additional medium for group communication that can be a complement to the strengths of the other media. By using a computer-based conference, a geographically dispersed group can have an efficient and orderly exchange of information and ideas in a way that makes it easy for all members of the group to participate without the usual time or place requirements. Use of such a facility by those in the specialty of dental public health could provide an important focus for ideas, information, discussion, and group identity.	0

8449595	Food-group consumption and colon cancer in the Adelaide Case-Control Study. II. Meat, poultry, seafood, dairy foods and eggs. We conducted a case-control study in Australia, comparing 220 persons with histologically confirmed incident adenocarcinoma of the colon with 438 age- and gender-matched controls. Cases were identified via the South Australian Cancer Registry (1979-80); controls were randomly selected from the electoral roll. All participants completed a 141-item food-frequency questionnaire and were interviewed regarding demographic and other information. Consumption of 8 groups of foods from animal sources was investigated. Odds ratios (OR) for quartiles of consumption were obtained using conditional logistic regression. All analyses were conducted separately for females and males. The most striking finding was a positive association for egg consumption in females, with an unadjusted OR of 2.4 (1.1-5.3) for consumption in the uppermost quartile. The uppermost septile of egg consumption was associated with an unadjusted OR of 6.3 (1.5-26.1) and a dose-response pattern was suggested. Intakes of red meat, liver, seafood, and dairy foods were also weakly positively associated with risk in females. In males, intakes of red meat and poultry were weakly positively associated with risk with unadjusted ORs of 1.5 (0.8-2.8) and 1.4 (0.7-2.6) respectively. The ratio of intake of red meat to poultry and seafood was also positively associated with risk in males, with an unadjusted OR of 1.4 (0.8-2.6). Interpretation of analyses stratified by colon cancer subsite was limited by the low number of subjects in each sub-site stratum, yet the results were somewhat supportive of a stronger risk associated with animal foods in the proximal than in the distal colon. The results for egg consumption suggest a role for cholesterol in the etiology of colon cancer, particularly in proximal cancer for females. Results for vegetable and fruit consumption are presented in a companion report.	0

23832133	Magnetic resonance volumetry reveals focal brain atrophy in transient epileptic amnesia. Transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) is a recently described epilepsy syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of isolated memory loss. It is associated with two unusual forms of interictal memory impairment: accelerated long-term forgetting (ALF) and autobiographical amnesia. We investigated the neural basis of TEA using manual volumetry and automated multi-atlas-based segmentation of whole-brain magnetic resonance imaging data from 40 patients with TEA and 20 healthy controls. Both methods confirmed the presence of subtle, bilateral hippocampal atrophy. Additional atrophy was revealed in perirhinal and orbitofrontal cortices. The volumes of these regions correlated with anterograde memory performance. No structural correlates were found for ALF or autobiographical amnesia. The results support the hypothesis that TEA is a focal medial temporal lobe epilepsy syndrome but reveal additional pathology in connected brain regions. The unusual interictal memory deficits of TEA remain unexplained by structural pathology and may reflect physiological disruption of memory networks by subclinical epileptiform activity.	0

15865625	Ab initio identification of putative human transcription factor binding sites by comparative genomics. BACKGROUND: Understanding transcriptional regulation of gene expression is one of the greatest challenges of modern molecular biology. A central role in this mechanism is played by transcription factors, which typically bind to specific, short DNA sequence motifs usually located in the upstream region of the regulated genes. We discuss here a simple and powerful approach for the ab initio identification of these cis-regulatory motifs. The method we present integrates several elements: human-mouse comparison, statistical analysis of genomic sequences and the concept of coregulation. We apply it to a complete scan of the human genome. RESULTS: By using the catalogue of conserved upstream sequences collected in the CORG database we construct sets of genes sharing the same overrepresented motif (short DNA sequence) in their upstream regions both in human and in mouse. We perform this construction for all possible motifs from 5 to 8 nucleotides in length and then filter the resulting sets looking for two types of evidence of coregulation: first, we analyze the Gene Ontology annotation of the genes in the set, searching for statistically significant common annotations; second, we analyze the expression profiles of the genes in the set as measured by microarray experiments, searching for evidence of coexpression. The sets which pass one or both filters are conjectured to contain a significant fraction of coregulated genes, and the upstream motifs characterizing the sets are thus good candidates to be the binding sites of the TF's involved in such regulation. In this way we find various known motifs and also some new candidate binding sites. CONCLUSION: We have discussed a new integrated algorithm for the \"ab initio\" identification of transcription factor binding sites in the human genome. The method is based on three ingredients: comparative genomics, overrepresentation, different types of coregulation. The method is applied to a full-scan of the human genome, giving satisfactory results.	0
7792529	[Mechanisms of bone loss in osteoporosis]. Aging and menopause are the two main determinants of osteoporosis, a rarifying osteopathy due to bone loss. Type I osteoporosis observed in post-menopausal women is characterized mainly by trabecular bone loss results from an unbalanced coupling between resorption and formation inducing a thinning of trabeculae and from an increased osteoclast activation resulting in irreversible trabecular perforation. Anti-osteoclastic drugs prevent trabecular and cortical bone loss. Drugs that stimulate osteoblastic proliferation thicken trabecular plates but do not restore the normal trabecular microarchitecture after complete destruction of a large number of trabeculae. In type II osteoporosis, cortical bone loss is favoured by secondary hyperparathyroidism and is responsible for hip fracture. Calcium and vitamin D supplementations decrease the risk of hip fractures by reducing the secondary hyperparathyroidism.	0
16361214	Implementation of brief alcohol intervention in primary health care: do nurses' and general practitioners' attitudes, skills and knowledge change? Brief alcohol intervention reduces heavy drinking, but its implementation has been challenging. The purpose was to evaluate self-reported changes in attitudes, skills and knowledge regarding brief intervention among nurses and general practitioners (GPs) during an implementation project. A questionnaire survey was used before and after the implementation to all nurses and GPs working at the time in the seven primary health-care centres of the city of Tampere, Finland. Several positive changes indicate an increased amount of knowledge regarding brief intervention among the professionals during the implementation. This was found especially among the nurses. The success in increasing the knowledge can also be seen in a decrease of training needs. Instead, attitudes and skills among the professionals did not seem to develop positively. Increasing motivational skills especially seems to be the future challenge.	0

18463996	Is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptom severity associated with tobacco use? Several studies report a strong link between ADHD and tobacco use; however, the nature of this relationship is not entirely clear. We examined the relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and tobacco use within a sample of college students. Although tobacco use was the main focus, we also examined alcohol and marijuana use. We examined the association between the number of ADHD symptoms endorsed (severity), and tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use in a convenience sample of 334 college students in the southeastern United States. Survey data were based on the annual Core Alcohol and Drug Survey for substance use, and the Current Symptom Scale (CSS) for ADHD, conduct disorder (CD), and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) symptoms. Among ever users of a substance, the number (severity) of current ADHD symptoms, including inattentive and hyperactive symptoms, were significantly associated with the frequency of tobacco and marijuana use in the past month and past year, as well as to the frequency of alcohol use in the past month. The results suggest that the number of ADHD symptoms is proportionally associated with tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use.	0

17536904	Multiphysics simulation of blood flow and LDL transport in a porohyperelastic arterial wall model. Atherosclerosis localizes at a bend andor bifurcation of an artery, and low density lipoproteins (LDL) accumulate in the intima. Hemodynamic factors are known to affect this localization and LDL accumulation, but the details of the process remain unknown. It is thought that the LDL concentration will be affected by the filtration flow, and that the velocity of this flow will be affected by deformation of the arterial wall. Thus, a coupled model of a blood flow and a deformable arterial wall with filtration flow would be invaluable for simulation of the flow field and concentration field in sequence. However, this type of highly coupled interaction analysis has not yet been attempted. Therefore, we performed a coupled analysis of an artery with multiple bends in sequence. First, based on the theory of porous media, we modeled a deformable arterial wall using a porohyperelastic model (PHEM) that was able to express both the filtration flow and the viscoelastic behavior of the living tissue, and simulated a blood flow field in the arterial lumen, a filtration flow field and a displacement field in the arterial wall using a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) program code by the finite element method (FEM). Next, based on the obtained results, we further simulated LDL transport using a mass transfer analysis code by the FEM. We analyzed the PHEM in comparison with a rigid model. For the blood flow, stagnation was observed downward of the bends. The direction of the filtration flow was only from the lumen to the wall for the rigid model, while filtration flows from both the wall to the lumen and the lumen to the wall were observed for the PHEM. The LDL concentration was high at the lumenwall interface for both the PHEM and rigid model, and reached its maximum value at the stagnation area. For the PHEM, the maximum LDL concentration in the wall in the radial direction was observed at the position of 3% wall thickness from the lumenwall interface, while for the rigid model, it was observed just at the lumenwall interface. In addition, the peak LDL accumulation area of the PHEM moved about according to the pulsatile flow. These results demonstrate that the blood flow, arterial wall deformation, and filtration flow all affect the LDL concentration, and that LDL accumulation is due to stagnation and the presence of filtration flow. Thus, FSI analysis is indispensable.	0
20689019	Profiling of the compounds absorbed in human plasma and urine after oral administration of a traditional Japanese (kampo) medicine, daikenchuto. Daikenchuto (DKT), a pharmaceutical-grade traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders including postoperative ileus and has been integrated into the modern medical care system in Japan as a prescription drug. DKT is a multiherbal medicine consisting of Japanese pepper (zanthoxylum fruit), processed ginger, and ginseng with maltose as an additive. Despite substantial research on the pharmacological activities of DKT and its ingredients, the lack of studies on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of DKT has made it difficult to obtain a consistent picture of its mechanism of action. In the present study, we constructed an analysis procedure consisting of seven conditions of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis, which enabled the identification of 44 ingredients of DKT component herbs. We investigated the plasma and urine profiles of these ingredients 0.5 to 8 h after oral administration of 15.0 g of DKT in four healthy volunteers. The results indicated that 1) hydroxy-a-sanshool and [6]-shogaol, the prominent peaks in plasma derived from Japanese pepper and ginger, respectively, were detected at 0.5 h and thereafter decreased throughout the sampling period; 2) ginsenoside Rb(1), a prominent peak derived from ginseng, increased gradually during the sampling period; 3) glucuronide conjugates of hydroxy-sanshools, shogaols, and gingerols were detected in plasma and urine; and 4) no obvious differences between samples from the two male and the two female individuals were observed. These results provide a strong basis for future studies on pharmacokinetics and pharmacology of DKT.	0
12417192	Indirect solid free form fabrication of local and global porous, biomimetic and composite 3D polymer-ceramic scaffolds. Precise control over scaffold material, porosity, and internal pore architecture is essential for tissue engineering. By coupling solid free form (SFF) manufacturing with conventional sponge scaffold fabrication procedures, we have developed methods for casting scaffolds that contain designed and controlled locally porous and globally porous internal architectures. These methods are compatible with numerous bioresorbable and non-resorbable polymers, ceramics, and biologic materials. Phase separation, emulsion-solvent diffusion, and porogen leaching were used to create poly(L)lactide (PLA) scaffolds containing both computationally designed global pores (500, 600, or 800 microm wide channels) and solvent fashioned local pores (50-100 microm wide voids or 5-10 microm length plates). Globally porous PLA and polyglycolide/PLA discrete composites were made using melt processing. Biphasic scaffolds with mechanically interdigitated PLA and sintered hydroxyapatite regions were fabricated with 500 and 600 microm wide global pores. PLA scaffolds with complex internal architectures that mimicked human trabecular bone were produced. Our indirect fabrication using casting in SFF molds provided enhanced control over scaffold shape, material, porosity and pore architecture, including size, geometry, orientation, branching, and interconnectivity. These scaffolds that contain concurrent local and global pores, discrete material regions, and biomimetic internal architectures may prove valuable for multi-tissue and structural tissue interface engineering.	0
6642446	Alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders. Primary alcoholics may display symptoms of affective or psychotic disorders, while mentally ill patients may develop persistent alcohol-related problems. The author discusses the importance of distinguishing alcoholic psychosis from schizophrenia and alcohol-induced confusion from organic brain syndrome. He then outlines the diagnosis and treatment of other alcohol-induced conditions such as alcoholic dementia, antisocial behavior, and drug abuse. After stressing that primary alcoholism can mimic almost any psychiatric disorder, and secondary alcohol abuse can exacerbate any psychiatric symptoms, the author asserts that physicians should routinely include substance abuse as part of the differential diagnosis of psychiatric patients.	0
17578200	[High-dose chemotherapy with transplantation of autologous stem cells in advanced germ-cell poor-risk testicular tumors]. Testicular tumors illustrate curable cancer, but 25% patients are resistant to standard therapy. High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) is promising therapy for germ-cell tumors with poor prognosis. HDC and transplantation of autologous stem cells were performed in 13 patients with germ-cell testicular tumors (GTT). In 6 patients of group 1 HDC was first-line treatment in poor prognosis, in 7 patients (group 2) it was a salvage treatment after recurrences. Patients of group 1 had longer mean survival than those of group 2 (31.3 and 11 months, respectively; p = 0.136). Two patients died of HDC complications. Neurological, hematological and other complications occurred. In spite of 50-90% remission after HDC, multicenter prospective randomized trials will give final conclusion on effectiveness of HDC which must be performed in special clinics having many specialists in their staff (urologists, oncologists, chemotherapists, etc.).	0
9160909	Doppler sensors and harnesses for cardiac and peripheral arterial flow monitoring. The objective of the present work was to design Doppler sensors and harnesses for monitoring in real time the cardiac stroke volume and output, the cerebral flow volume and resistance and the lower limb arterial flow and resistance changes. For the middle cerebral artery investigation we used a 2-MHz transcranial pulsed wave (PW) Doppler probe (commercial probe) mounted on a rotula, fixed on the horizontal branch of a headset designed like an audio headset. The arch of the headset passed over the top of the skull. For the common carotid investigation, a 4-MHz continuous-wave (CW) or PW flat Doppler probe was inserted in a circular silicone support of 5-cm diameter and 0.6-cm thickness. This soft support could adapt to the irregular surface of the neck, and the silicone material, which is fairly adhesive to the skin, made the system stable. The transducers were preoriented at 45 degrees from the support, which provided an acceptable orientation of the Doppler beam. The aortic Doppler harness consisted of a 2-MHz PW Doppler probe, mounted on a rotula fixed on a plastic rigid support 7 x 1.5 cm2 in area (parallel to the sternum) whose length could be changed (4-7 cm) to localize the rotula and its sensor on the suprasternal area. This flat segment was fixed on a rotating platform, part of a solid square plastic support (10 x 10 cm2) placed on the upper part of the sternum. This system was maintained by elastic bands passing around the shoulder and the chest. The femoral Doppler harness consisted of a 4-MHz CW or PW flat Doppler probe, inserted in a flat and rectangular rigid plastic support 10 x 3 cm2 in area. This rigid support was well adapted to the flat surface of the internal part of the thigh, which made the system stable. Two elastic bands passed around the thigh and the abdomen, which avoided any translation of the support and kept the sensor in contact with the skin. The transducers were preoriented at 45 degrees from the support, which provided an acceptable orientation of the Doppler beam. The whole Doppler monitoring system was successfully tested during orthostatic tests, such as lower body negative pressure or tilt table tests performed in pre and post head-down tilt experiments and space flights, with the objective of assessing and quantifying the cardiac and peripheral arterial hemodynamic changes associated with orthostatic intolerance.	0
21965347	Developmentally regulated IL6-type cytokines signal to germ cells in the human fetal ovary. Fetal ovarian development and primordial follicle formation are imperative for adult fertility in the female. Data suggest the interleukin (IL)6-type cytokines, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL6, oncostatin M (OSM) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), are able to regulate the survival, proliferation and differentiation of fetal murine germ cells (GCs) in vivo and in vitro. We postulated that these factors may play a similar role during early human GC development and primordial follicle formation. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the expression and regulation of IL6-type cytokines, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Expression of transcripts encoding OSM increased significantly across the gestational range examined (8-20 weeks), while expression of IL6 increased specifically between the first (8-11 weeks) and early second (12-16 weeks) trimesters, co-incident with the initiation of meiosis. LIF and CNTF expression remained unchanged. Expression of the genes encoding the LIF and IL6 receptors, and their common signalling subunit gp130, was also found to be developmentally regulated, with expression increasing significantly with increasing gestation. LIF receptor and gp130 proteins localized exclusively to GCs, including oocytes in primordial follicles, indicating this cell type to be the sole target of IL6-type cytokine signalling in the human fetal ovary. These data establish that IL6-type cytokines and their receptors are expressed in the human fetal ovary and may directly influence GC development at multiple stages of maturation.	0

19495500	Embryonated duck (\"balut\") eggshell aspiration in a one-year-old boy. A one-year-old boy with two months' chronic cough and dysphonia, unresponsive to therapy for pneumonia, had a radiopaque, wedge-shaped tracheal foreign body noted on anteroposterior, but not lateral radiographs, and he eventually became aphonic. Laryngoscopy yielded a subglottic embryonated duck eggshell. Foreign body aspiration should be considered in the presence of chronic cough. Radiopaque airway foreign bodies may be metallic or calcific. The patient was fond of sucking soup from a partially-shelled embryonated duck egg. The last occasion occurred immediately before the onset of cough. The hard egg white of the same delicacy is a commonly-ingested oesophageal foreign body in the Philippines, but the preceding slurping of the amniotic fluid predisposes one to unusual eggshell aspiration. With the continuing global migration of overseas workers and their families, healthcare providers with Asian and Southeast Asian clients should consider such cultural practices in assessing symptoms suggestive of aerodigestive foreign bodies.	0
20171815	Clinical monitoring of systemic hemodynamics in critically ill newborns. Circulatory failure is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in critically ill newborn infants. Since objective measurement of systemic blood flow remains very challenging, neonatal hemodynamics is usually assessed by the interpretation of various clinical and biochemical parameters. An overview is given about the predictive value of the most used indicators of circulatory failure, which are blood pressure, heart rate, urine output, capillary refill time, serum lactate concentration, central-peripheral temperature difference, pH, standard base excess, central venous oxygen saturation and colour.	0
8049955	Healing characteristics of polymer-coated or collagen-treated Dacron grafts: an experimental porcine study. The healing characteristics of polymer-coated Dacron grafts with or without heparin-bonding and collagen-coated Dacron grafts are compared with standard knitted Dacron grafts by implanting eight of each graft into pig iliac arteries. The grafts were implanted at random bilaterally with end-to-side anastomoses. The grafts were explanted after 1, 2 and 4 weeks and prepared for histological evaluation by in vivo fixation. Graft segments were investigated by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The endothelial coverage, intimal thickness and healing characteristics were subjected to one-way analysis of variance. One week after surgery endothelial-like cells appeared close to the anastomoses and after 2 weeks a clear growing endothelial edge was observed in the collagen-coated grafts. After 4 weeks' implantation all grafts were patent and endothelial cells covered the grafts to a various extent. Collagen-coated grafts had significantly greater endothelial cell coverage compared with Dacron and polymer-coated grafts without heparin bonding (P < 0.05). Evaluation by transmission electron microscopy revealed the luminal coverage of the collagen-coated grafts to consist of organized smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells containing Weibel-Palade bodies. The smooth muscle cells in the other grafts were less organized and were covered by endothelial cells to a lesser degree. No differences were noted regarding the inflammatory response of the graft materials and no further positive effects were encountered by the addition of heparin to the polymer coating. The study demonstrates that various coating procedures and surface modulation of knitted Dacron grafts produce a graft which is impervious to blood but still allows tissue incorporation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0

16276778	Hydride-based silica stationary phases for HPLC: fundamental properties and applications. Silica hydride is a recent development in chromatographic support materials for HPLC where hydride groups replace 95% of the silanols on the surface. This conversion changes many of the fundamental properties of the material as well as the bonded stationary phases that are the result of further chemical modification of the hydride surface. The general approach for fabricating the silica hydride and subsequent bonded phases is reviewed. Properties of the silica hydride surface are compared to those of the standard material obtained in the preparation of most commercial HPLC stationary phases. Some unique chromatographic properties of hydride-based phases are described as well as some general application areas where these bonded materials may be used in preference to or have advantages not available from typical stationary phases.	0

18022952	Characterization of brainstem peptide YY (PYY) neurons. Peptide YY (PYY), a member of the NPY superfamily of peptides, is predominantly synthesized by the colon and is thought to act on both the gut and brain to modulate energy homeostasis. Although neurons expressing PYY mRNA have also been reported in the brainstem, little is known about their physiological role and study of their projections has been problematic due to crossreactivity of PYY antibodies with NPY. In the present study we examined the localization of central PYY cell bodies in the mouse, rat, and monkey. In addition, efferent projections and afferent inputs of central PYY neurons were examined in rodents. Central PYY projections were examined by immunohistochemistry in the NPY knockout mouse, or with an NPY-preabsorbed PYY antibody in the rat to avoid any crossreactivity with NPY. In all species investigated PYY-immunoreactive (ir) cell bodies were localized exclusively to the gigantocellular reticular nucleus (Gi) of the rostral medulla. The highest density of PYY fibers was present within the solitary tract nucleus, specifically within the dorsal and lateral aspects. PYY fibers were also concentrated within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the hypoglossal nucleus. In addition, both orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone fibers made numerous close appositions with PYY cell bodies in the Gi. Collectively, the projection pattern and association with orexigenic neuropeptides suggest that brainstem PYY neurons may play a role in energy homeostasis through a coordinated effect on visceral, motor, and sympathetic output targets.	0

6837763	Interactions between baroreceptor and sympathetic pathways. The interactions between baroreceptor and sympathetic pathways were determined in anesthetized cats using computer summation techniques. Electrical stimuli applied to baroreceptor afferent nerves produced an early and late period of inhibition of sympathetic nervous discharge (SND) recorded from the external carotid or inferior cardiac nerves. The late period of baroreceptor-induced inhibition summated algebraically with the cardiac-locked slow wave of SND during all phases of the cardiac cycle. Increases in the intensity of baroreceptor stimulation resulted in an increase in the amplitude and duration of the late inhibition. Alterations in the periodicity of SND failed to effect the late phase of inhibition. Picrotoxin blocked the late period of baroreceptor-induced inhibition but enhanced the cardiac locking of SND. These data indicate that the late period of inhibition reflects the ability of afferent nerves to modulate the amplitude of central sympathetic outflow, regardless of its periodicity. In addition, the central baroreceptor pathways involved in amplitude modulation and temporal locking of SND to the cardiac cycle are distinct and are located at the level of the brain stem. A spinal component of baroreceptor-induced sympathoinhibition is also described.	0

20631413	Endurance training increases exercise-induced prostacyclin release in young, healthy men--relationship with VO2max. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of 5 weeks of moderate-intensity endurance training on the basal and exercise-induced systemic release of prostacyclin (PGI(2)), as assessed by plasma 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) concentration. Twelve physically active young men with the following characteristics participated in this study (the mean +/- SD): age, 22.7 +/- 2.0 years; body mass, 76.8 +/- 8.9 kg; BMI, 23.48 +/- 2.17 kg x m(-2); and maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2 max)), 46.1 +/- 4.0 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1). Plasma 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) concentrations were measured in venous blood samples taken prior to the exercise and at exhaustion (at VO(2 max)) before and after completing the training protocol. On average, the training resulted in a significant increase in VO(2 max) (p = 0.03), power output at VO(2 max) (p = 0.001) and a significant increase (p = 0.05) in the net-exercise-induced increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) concentration (Delta 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) i.e., the difference between the end-exercise and pre-exercise 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) concentrations). No effect of training on the basal PGI(2) concentration was found. Interestingly, within the study sample (n = 12), two subgroups could be defined with a differential pattern of response with respect to Delta 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) concentrations. In one subgroup (n = 7), a significant increase in Delta 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) concentration after training was found (p < 0.02) (responders). This enhancement in the exercise-induced PGI(2) release was accompanied by a significant (p < 0.05) increase in VO(2 max) after training. In contrast, in another subgroup (n = 5), there was no observed effect of training on the Delta 6-keto-PGF(1 alpha) concentration and the VO(2 max) after training (non-responders). In both of these subgroups, training did not influence the basal PGI(2) concentration. In conclusion, the endurance training resulted in the adaptive augmentation of the systemic release of PGI(2) in response to exercise, which plays a role in the training-induced increase in VO(2 max) in young, healthy men. The impairment of the training-induced augmentation of PGI(2) release in response to exercise demonstrated in the non-responders subgroup may predispose them to increased cardiovascular risk during vigorous exercise.	0
16447795	[Pleural effusion associated with long-term dantrolene administration in three patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities]. Chronic unilateral pleural effusion developed in three patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. All patients received 5-15 years of dantrolene administration for their spasticity. The cause of pleural effusion was indistinct, despite close investigations for etiologies such as infection or tumor. The pleural fluid consisted of sterile exudate in all patients. One patient had eosinophilia in his pleural fluid, while peripheral blood eosinophilia was seen in the other two. The pleural biopsy and autopsy specimens revealed only non-specific inflammatory findings. After dantrolene therapy was discontinued, pleural effusion almost disappeared in two patients in the following several months, but the other died of multi-organ failure from another underlying disease. It is important to take chemical pleurisy into consideration when dealing with pleural effusion of unknown etiology. Moreover, respiratory side effect should be examined in patients treated with chronic dantrolene administration.	0

22232652	Structure of ice crystallized from supercooled water. The freezing of water to ice is fundamentally important to fields as diverse as cloud formation to cryopreservation. At ambient conditions, ice is considered to exist in two crystalline forms: stable hexagonal ice and metastable cubic ice. Using X-ray diffraction data and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that ice that crystallizes homogeneously from supercooled water is neither of these phases. The resulting ice is disordered in one dimension and therefore possesses neither cubic nor hexagonal symmetry and is instead composed of randomly stacked layers of cubic and hexagonal sequences. We refer to this ice as stacking-disordered ice I. Stacking disorder and stacking faults have been reported earlier for metastable ice I, but only for ice crystallizing in mesopores and in samples recrystallized from high-pressure ice phases rather than in water droplets. Review of the literature reveals that almost all ice that has been identified as cubic ice in previous diffraction studies and generated in a variety of ways was most likely stacking-disordered ice I with varying degrees of stacking disorder. These findings highlight the need to reevaluate the physical and thermodynamic properties of this metastable ice as a function of the nature and extent of stacking disorder using well-characterized samples.	0
16611611	Elder mistreatment in urban India: a community based study. This study examined the extent and correlates of elder mistreatment among 400 community dwelling older adults aged 65 and above in Chennai, India. The prevalence rate of mistreatment was 14%. Chronic verbal abuse was the most common followed by financial abuse and the rate of physical abuse and neglect was similar. Among the mistreated, exactly half of them had experienced more than one type of mistreatment (multifaceted-mistreatment). With the exception of financial abuse, a significantly greater number of women experienced verbal and physical abuse as well as neglect compared to men. Adult children, daughters-in-law, spouses, and sons-in-law were the prominent perpetrators. The mistreated older adults were more depressed and less satisfied with life than those who were not mistreated. Logistic regression analysis revealed gender, social support, and subjective rating of physical health as significant factors associated with abuse.	0
20833033	False-positive Human Papillomavirus DNA tests in cervical screening: it is all in a definition. AIM: Based on data from randomised controlled trials (RCT) on primary cervical screening, it has been reported that the problem of more frequent false-positive tests in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening compared to cytology could be overcome. However, these reports predominantly operated with a narrow definition of a (false-)positive test. The aim of this paper was to illustrate how the narrow definition affected the measured adverse effects of HPV DNA screening compared with cytology screening. METHODS: In the European RCT data, we measured the impact of the narrow definition of a positive screening test on the published relative positive predictive values (PPV), an indicator of the relative frequency of false-positive screening tests. RESULTS: Using the trialists' definitions of positive screening tests, HPV screening combined with cytology triage had relative PPVs of 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-1.26) for >=  CIN3 based on Swedish RCT data, and 0.78 (0.52-1.16) for >=  CIN2 in the Italian Phase 1 RCT (25-34 years). These PPVs changed to 0.44 (0.30-0.64) and 0.51 (0.33-0.79), respectively, when all positive HPV or cytology screening tests were accounted for. In the Finnish RCT data, HPV screening using the cut-off point of >=  10 pg/ml had a relative PPV of 0.27 (0.15-0.50) for >=  CIN3, which changed to 1.84 (0.99-3.41). CONCLUSION: The relative PPV was incorrectly estimated in six out of seven studies. In three of those six studies, the relative PPV changed significantly after inclusion of the previously erroneously excluded false-positive HPV or cytology tests.	0
17306481	Anti-anaemic potentials of aqueous extract of Sorghum bicolor (L.) moench stem bark in rats. The effects of oral administration of aqueous extract of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench stem bark at the doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg body weight on iron sufficient and iron deficient weaning rats were investigated. Weaning rats of 21 days old were maintained on iron sufficient and iron deficient diets for 6 weeks before the administration of the aqueous extract of Sorghum bicolor stem bark at various doses for 7 days. Proximate analysis of the iron sufficient and iron deficient diets showed that they were similar except in the amount of iron. Phytochemical screening of the extract revealed the presence of alkaloids and saponins. Extract administration produced significant increase in haemoglobin, packed cell volume and red blood cells in iron sufficient and iron deficient groups (P < 0.05). There was also significant increase (P < 0.05) in the catalase activity of the rat liver and kidney without any significant change (P > 0.05) in the serum catalase activity. The results revealed that extract administration has restored the anaemic condition in the iron deficient group and thus lend credence to its use in folklore medicine in the management of anaemia.	0

17358686	Weakly nonlinear analysis of the magnetorotational instability in a model channel flow. We show by means of a perturbative weakly nonlinear analysis that the axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) of a viscous, resistive, incompressible rotating shear flow subject to a background vertical magnetic field in a thin channel gives rise to a Ginzburg-Landau equation for the disturbance amplitude. For small magnetic Prandtl number (P(m)), the saturation amplitude is proportional square root P(m) and the resulting momentum transport scales as R(-1), where R is the hydrodynamic Reynolds number. Simplifying assumptions, such as linear shear base flow, mathematically expedient boundary conditions, and continuous spectrum of the vertical linear modes, are used to facilitate this analysis. The asymptotic results are shown to comply with numerical calculations using a spectral code. They suggest that the transport due to the nonlinearly developed MRI may be very small in experimental setups with P(m)<1.	0
8725023	Anterior hydrogel lens deposits: polished vs. unpolished surfaces. Traditionally, lathe cut hydrogel lenses receive both back and front surface polishing to eliminate any surface irregularities that might serve as potential attachment sites for lens deposits or even microorganisms. However, with the advent of newer more technologically advanced lathing equipment, the need for lens polishing may require renewed justification. This study sought to compare, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), anterior lens surface deposit formation on polished and unpolished 55% water hydrogel lenses. A total of 10 subjects wore in 1 eye (control) a lens with both front and back lens surfaces polished and on the other eye (test) a lens with only the back lens surface polished for a period of 2 weeks on a daily wear basis. Each lens was then scanned (using SEM), with 3 separate regions photographed at 30x using a 10 kV electron source. Using a Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test on the differences between average deposit ratings for the polished and the unpolished lenses, by subject pair, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the difference was zero.	0
11751125	Optimization of xanthones for antimalarial activity: the 3,6-bis-omega-diethylaminoalkoxyxanthone series. Hydroxyxanthones have been identified as novel antimalarial agents. The compounds are believed to exert their activity by complexation to heme and inhibition of hemozoin formation. Modification of the xanthone structure was pursued to improve their antimalarial activity. Attachment of R-groups bearing protonatable nitrogen atoms was conducted to enhance heme affinity through ionic interactions with the propionate side chains of the metalloporphyrin and to facilitate drug accumulation in the parasite food vacuole. A series of 3,6-bis-omega-diethylaminoalkoxyxanthones with side chains ranging from 2 to 8 carbon atoms were prepared and evaluated. Measurement of heme affinity for each of the derivatives revealed a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.97) between affinity and antimalarial potency. The two most active compounds in the series contained 5- and 6-carbon side chains and exhibited low nanomolar 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values against strains of chloroquine-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in vitro. Both of these xanthones exhibit stronger heme affinity (8.26 x 10(5) and 9.02 x 10(5) M(-1), respectively) than either chloroquine or quinine under similar conditions and appear to complex heme in a unique manner.	0
8906841	Mechanisms of stimulation of the respiratory burst by TNF in nonadherent neutrophils: its independence of lipidic transmembrane signaling and dependence on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeleton. This study concerns the controversial problem of whether the TNF-alpha (TNF) induces a respiratory burst in human neutrophils in suspension. The results have shown that in these cells TNF induces a classical respiratory burst. In fact, the production of oxygen free radicals 1) is linked to the translocation of NADPH oxidase components from cytosol to the plasma membrane, 2) does not take place in neutrophils from a patient lacking the cytochrome b558, and 3) does not involve other sources such as mitochondrial respiratory chain or xanthine oxidase. Signal transduction studies have demonstrated that this respiratory burst 1) is not accompanied by calcium transients, stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, and phospholipase D activity (moreover, this burst is associated with the stimulation of the activity of phospholipase A2, but not of sphingomyelinase); 2) is strictly dependent on activation of tyrosine kinases, which is functional to the translocation to the plasma membrane of the cytosolic NADPH oxidase component rac; and 3) is dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton because it is completely suppressed by cytochalasin B. The integrity of the cytoskeleton is required for a full translocation of all the NADPH oxidase components and for an optimal activation of tyrosine kinases, but not for phospholipase A2 activation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that TNF activates the NADPH oxidase through stimulation of tyrosine kinases, whose function is cytoskeleton-dependent, and raise the problem of whether the activation of this respiratory burst involves signals arising from TNF-activated beta2 integrins.	0

Traditional treatment options for the adult with severe head injury have included hyperventilation, elevation of the head of the bed, sedation, chemical paralysis, fluid restriction, diuresis, anticonvulsant therapy, and barbiturate coma. These interventions for severe head injury are reviewed and updated with current research. Neuroprotective drugs (including glutamate antagonists, oxygen free radical scavengers, and high dose steroids) are introduced, along with monitoring of jugular venous oxygen saturation and the role of the transcranial Doppler. The role of the critical care nurse in the treatment and monitoring of the adult with severe head injury is discussed.	0
9806039	A community-based seroepidemiologic study of Helicobacter pylori infection in Mexico. A nationwide community-based survey for Helicobacter pylori infection had not been done. This study sought to determine the seroprevalence of infection in Mexico, and the socioeconomic and demographic variables that are risk factors for infection. The survey assessed 11,605 sera from a sample population representing persons ages 1-90 years from all socioeconomic and demographic levels and from all regions of Mexico. Antibodies against H. pylori were studied by ELISA using whole cell antigen. Among the findings were that 66% of the population was infected and that age was the strongest risk factor for infection. By age 1 year, 20% were infected and by age 10 years, 50% were infected. Crowding (odds ratio [OR], 1.4), low educational level (OR, 2.42), and low socioeconomic level (OR, 1.43) were risk factors for infection. Prevalence was similar in urban and in rural communities (OR, 0.95). This study is the largest community-based seroepidemiologic study of H. pylori to date.	0

23228153	Establishment of a medium-throughput approach for the genotyping of RHD variants and report of nine novel rare alleles. BACKGROUND: The routinely used serologic methods are robust in accurately typing standard D- or D+ blood. However, they result in discrepancy in weak or partial D blood, which requires genetic analysis. We have previously used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) to screen the entire RHD-coding sequence. However, DHPLC is technically challenging, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. To overcome these inconveniences, we sought to develop a new two-step approach. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 430 blood samples with D phenotype ambiguity were recruited for this study. The three most frequent weak D alleles (i.e., weak D, Type   1; weak D, Type   2; and weak D, Type   3), which altogether account for 60% to 90% of the atypical RHD alleles in the Caucasian population, were first identified by Tm-shift genotyping. The remaining unidentified samples were then subjected to a single-tube multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 10 RHD exons followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Optimal conditions for efficient and reliable identification of the three most common weak D variants by Tm-shift genotyping were established. All 10 RHD exons were successfully amplified in a single-multiplex PCR procedure. Employment of the two-step analysis identified RHD variants in 91.6% of the 430 studied samples. Two of the nine previously undescribed variants, c.335G>T and c.939G>A, were found to cause aberrant mRNA splicing by means of a splicing minigene assay. CONCLUSION: The new two-step analysis proved to be much easier and cheaper than the DHPLC method and therefore is convenient to be used as a routine, medium-throughput approach for RHD genotyping.	0

8452511	Transfer of IgG from serum to lachrymal fluid in chickens. Pure 125I-radiolabeled chicken IgG was inoculated intravenously into 2-week old chickens. Radioactivity in lachrymal fluid samples was first detected 10 minutes postinoculation (PI). Radioactivity levels declined up to day 20 PI, when they reached marginal levels. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by autoradiography of lachrymal fluid samples, taken daily for 16 days, showed the presence of radioactive polypeptides in the same positions as their stained control counterparts at molecular weights corresponding to heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins. Radiolabeled IgG also was detected in serum samples of the inoculated chickens. SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of lachrymal samples taken until day 16 PI showed similar results. These results demonstrate that transfer of IgG from serum to lachrymal fluid does occur in chickens.	0

15913141	Sensitive flow-injection amperometric detection of iodide using Mn3+ and As3+. A rapid, selective, and sensitive kinetic flow-injection method for iodide content determination with amperometric detection on a platinum electrode was developed. The method is based on the catalytic effect of iodide on the Mn3+ reaction with As3+ in the presence of sulfuric acid. The calibration curve was linear in the concentration range from 5.0 x 10(-7) to 1.0 x 10(-4) mol/L iodide. The limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 5.0 x 10(-9) mol/L iodide. The relative standard deviations (RSD) were 1.68% and 3.03% for 1.0 x 10(-3) mol/L standard and 1.0 x 10(-6) mol/L iodide solution (n = 6), respectively. The method has been successfully applied for determination of iodide in waters, table salts, fodder, organic substances and human blood sera. The results were compared with those obtained by a standard AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) method, as well as with those obtained by a kinetic spectrophotometric procedure for determination of iodide.	0
16843834	Imaging of aromatase distribution in rat and rhesus monkey brains with [11C]vorozole. Aromatase is an enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens and may play a role in mood and mental status. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that brain aromatase distribution could be evaluated with a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(11)C]vorozole. Vorozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor that reversibly binds to the heme domain of aromatase. In vitro experiments in rat brain, using frozen section autoradiography, illustrated specific binding in the medial amygdala (MA), the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) and the preoptic area (POA) of male rat brain. Specific binding in female rat brain was found in the MA and the BST; however, the signals were lower than those of males. The K(d) of [(11)C]vorozole binding to aromatase in MA was determined to be 0.60+/-0.06 nM by Scatchard plot analysis using homogenates. An in vivo PET study in female rhesus monkey brain demonstrated the uptake of [(11)C]vorozole in the amygdala, where the uptake was blocked by the presence of excess amounts of unlabeled vorozole. Thus, this tracer has a high affinity for brain aromatase and could have a potential for in vivo aromatase imaging. This technique might enable the investigation of human brain aromatase in healthy and diseased persons.	0
18765606	Short communication: isolation of Prototheca species strains from environmental sources in dairy herds. Composite milk samples from 548 cows, and samples from feces, feed, bedding, water, liners (before and after milking), and the postdipping product were aseptically collected from 2 Italian dairy herds from February to November of 2006. Prototheca zopfii was isolated from 11.9% of milk samples, 15% of feces, and 33.3% of bedding samples. No viable cells of P. zopfii were observed in water before washing procedures, whereas 25 to 28.6% of samples from water used for washing both refrigeration tanks and milking equipment were contaminated with this yeast-like microalga. Analogously, the presence of P. zopfii was detected only on swabs collected from the liners after milking. Interestingly, in 1 of the 2 herds, water from the drinking trough was contaminated by viable cells of both P. zopfii and the related environmental species Prototheca stagnora. No viable cells were observed in cow feed. On the basis of the results presented herein, P. zopfii seemed to be widespread throughout the environments of dairy herds where outbreaks of bovine mastitis had occurred.	0
20184968	Exposure of mussels to a polluted environment: insights into the stress syndrome development. Coastal environments are often subjected to contamination, whose biological impact is profitably evaluated through sentinel organisms and biomarkers. mRNA profiling was also proposed as a potential biomarker, whose relevance is still under discussion. Indeed, correlation between molecular and cell-organism responses need further investigations, especially under field conditions. In this study, we followed the development of physiological alterations in Mytilus galloprovincialis transplanted into a polluted coastal lagoon for 2, 4, 7, 14 and 30 days. Three consolidated biomarkers were measured, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability, lipofuscin and metallothionein contents. In parallel, the expressions of stress-related genes encoding metallothioneins (mt10 and mt20), 70-kDa heat shock proteins (MgHSC70 and MgHSP70), and Multi Xenobiotic Resistance-related transporters (MgPgp, MgMrp2, and MgMvp) were analyzed, to have a greater insight into the time-related evolution of the response. Significant (p<0.05) biomarker responses were induced after 7 days of exposure and further increased with time, whereas gene expression profiles were dramatically altered 2 days after transplanting. Biomarkers and gene expression profiles indicated a stress syndrome development in mussels, although with different temporal patterns. Their combined application provided insights into the molecular and cellular basis of mussel responses to challenging environments, and may have far-reaching implications for monitoring environmental health.	0

18521079	DAPK2 is a novel E2F1/KLF6 target gene involved in their proapoptotic function. Death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK2) belongs to a family of proapoptotic Ca(2+)/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine kinases. We recently identified DAPK2 as an enhancing factor during granulocytic differentiation. To identify transcriptional DAPK2 regulators, we cloned 2.7 kb of the 5'-flanking region of the DAPK2 gene. We found that E2F1 and Kr  ppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) strongly activate the DAPK2 promoter. We mapped the E2F1 and KLF6 responsive elements to a GC-rich region 5' of exon 1 containing several binding sites for KLF6 and Sp1 but not for E2F. Moreover, we showed that transcriptional activation of DAPK2 by E2F1 and KLF6 is dependent on Sp1 using Sp1/KLF6-deficient insect cells, mithramycin A treatment to block Sp1-binding or Sp1 knockdown cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed recruitment of Sp1 and to lesser extent that of E2F1 and KLF6 to the DAPK2 promoter. Activation of E2F1 in osteosarcoma cells led to an increase of endogenous DAPK2 paralleled by cell death. Inhibition of DAPK2 expression resulted in significantly reduced cell death upon E2F1 activation. Similarly, KLF6 expression in H1299 cells increased DAPK2 levels accompanied by cell death that is markedly decreased upon DAPK2 knockdown. Moreover, E2F1 and KLF6 show cooperation in activating the DAPK2 promoter. In summary, our findings establish DAPK2 as a novel Sp1-dependent target gene for E2F1 and KLF6 in cell death response.	1
7187669	Comparison of English and French versions of a dichotic auditory perception test (SSW) on normal bilingual subjects. Young adult, normal-hearing, Canadian-French Ss (5 M, 5 F) from Montreal were matched for sex, age, and education with 10 Canadian-English Ss. Each S self-rated his receptive and expressive abilities in his non-native language. Then, all were given a new French and a standard English version of the SSW test. After controlling for second-language ability as a covariate, ANOVA showed performance significantly worse in the second language and in the dichotic condition. French Ss performed better on the non-dichotic condition of the English SSW than did English Ss on the French version. This study suggests that the new Canadian-French version of the SSW test is comparable in difficulty to the original English EC tape, but cautions against clinical use of SSW tasks with second-language Ss.	0
18636415	Antioxidant status and lipid peroxidation in the blood of breast cancer patients of different ages. Oxidative stress is considered to be implicated in the pathophysiology of breast cancers. In this study we investigated the level of oxidative stress and antioxidant (AO) status in the blood of breast cancer patients of different ages. The level of lipid hydroperoxides (LP) was measured in blood plasma and the activities of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes, as well as the level of total glutathione (GSH) and CuZnSOD protein were measured in blood cells of breast cancer patients and age-matched healthy subjects. Our results showed that breast carcinoma is related to increase of lipid peroxidation in plasma with concomitant decrease of AO defense capacity in blood cells, which becomes more pronounced during aging of the patients. Suppression of CuZnSOD activity related to breast cancer is most likely caused by decreased de novo synthesis of this enzyme. Similar patterns of suppression in CuZnSOD and CAT activities related to aging were recorded both in controls and patients. Age-related decrease in CuZnSOD activity seems not to be caused by altered protein levels of this enzyme. Suppression of AO enzymes associated with breast cancer and aging is most likely the cause of increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our results indicate significant role of oxidative-induced injury in the breast carcinogenesis, particularly during the later stages of aging. Overall, our data support the importance of endogenous AOs in the etiology of breast cancer across all levels of predicted risk.	0

9592709	[Ambulatory catheter ablation. Indications, results and risks]. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of outpatient radiofrequency catheter ablation in 162 consecutive patients. There were 83 men and 79 women at a mean age of 47 + 15 years; 13 patients underwent 2 and 1 patient 3 ablation procedures. In 167 cases patients suffered from highly symptomatic paroxysmal tachycardia associated with presyncope or syncope in 74. Severe palpitations were present in 7 cases and recurrent syncope in 1 case. One patient had an asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a shortest RR-interval during atrial fibrillation of 150 ms. The mechanism of tachycardia was found to be atrioventricular nodal reentry in 78 cases, atrioventricular reentry involving an accessory atrioventricular pathway in 56, atrial fibrillation in 16, atrial flutter of the common type in 15, ectopic atrial tachycardia in 8, and idiopathic ventricular tachycardia in 3. Catheter ablation was performed in these 176 cases at an overall success rate of 86%. In 148 cases patients could be treated on an outpatient basis and were discharged after a maximal observation time of 3 hours in 28, and 24 hours in another 120 cases. Short-term follow-up was uneventful in these patients. After 28 ablation procedures patients had to be admitted to the hospital, because of pain at the puncture sites or after pacemaker implantation in 15 cases, because of minor complications in 12, and because of pericardial tamponade in 1 case. Another severe complication occurred in 1 patient after successful ablation of right atrial tachycardia. Three days after discharge the patient suffered from pulmonary embolism originating from a thrombus at the ablation site. After hospital admission the patient recovered completely. In general, complication rate was 2.27%. This study shows that catheter ablation can be performed effectively and safety on an outpatient basis.	0
21293007	Developmental and regenerative biology of multipotent cardiovascular progenitor cells. Our limited ability to improve the survival of patients with heart failure is attributable, in part, to the inability of the mammalian heart to meaningfully regenerate itself. The recent identification of distinct families of multipotent cardiovascular progenitor cells from endogenous, as well as exogenous, sources, such as embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, has raised much hope that therapeutic manipulation of these cells may lead to regression of many forms of cardiovascular disease. Although the exact source and cell type remains to be clarified, our greater understanding of the scientific underpinning behind developmental cardiovascular progenitor cell biology has helped to clarify the origin and properties of diverse cells with putative cardiogenic potential. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the understanding of cardiovascular progenitor cell biology from embryogenesis to adulthood and their implications for therapeutic cardiac regeneration. We believe that a detailed understanding of cardiogenesis will inform future applications of cardiovascular progenitor cells in heart failure therapy and regenerative medicine.	0
21257876	Cardiovascular disease and stroke in women: role of radiology. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this review are to describe the clinical presentation and diagnostic test characteristics in the care of women with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and to discuss the role of newer imaging modalities in improving diagnostic accuracy in the detection of these diseases. CONCLUSION: Despite major advances in both diagnostics and therapeutics, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases remain two of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among women worldwide. More research is needed into sex differences in these diseases, particularly to discern whether accurate imaging can lead to early diagnosis, change in clinical management, and overall improvement in patient outcomes.	0
18350502	[Switch from Darbepoetin-alpha to Epoetin-alpha: cost and efficacy comparison for haemodialytic patients over one year follow-up in a single centre]. Due to the increased emphasis on cost-containment, drugs must be proven not only to be safe and effective, but also to reduce costs, prior to be used in clinical practice. In the context of this saving policy, 12 clinically stable patients on hemodialysis who were administered darbepoetin-alpha (Aranesp (DARB) for at least 16 months in single weekly doses, were converted to EPO-alpha, administered 2-3 times per week. The initial dose of EPO-alpha was calculated on the basis of a dose-conversion ratio (DCR) of 200 IU EPO-alpha = 1 mcg DARB. The mean Hb value in the six months preceding the conversion was between 11 and 12 g/dL, with a monthly dose of DARB unchanged/ reduced during the last three months. During the last month of treatment with DARB, the mean Hb value of the cohort was 11.4+/-0.5 g/dL and the mean weekly dose per patient was 24 +/- 12 mcg. After two months of EPO-alpha use, the mean Hb value dropped to 10.8+/-0.7 g/dL, with a mean monthly dose per patient of 5.667+/-2.229 IU, corresponding to a DCR of 234. In order to bring the Hb values back to above 11 g/dL, doses of EPO-alpha were progressively increased up to a maximum of 10.000+/-5.461 IU per patient, corresponding to a DCR of 414. The attempt to convert 12 hemodialysis patients treated with darbepoetin-alpha to an ESA with an apparent lower cost resulted in a worsening of the anemia of the patients after the conversion. Instead of leading to savings, the conversion actually increased expenditures.	0

6698020	Functional association of a monoacylglycerophosphocholine acyltransferase and the oleoylglycerophosphocholine desaturase in microsomes from developing leaves. The biosynthesis of linoleic acid has been investigated, using oleoyl-CoA as a substrate, in microsomal preparations from young leaves of Pisum sativum. Oleoyl moieties from oleoyl-CoA were preferentially acylated to lysophosphatidylcholine by an acyltransferase to produce an oleoylglycerophosphocholine. Kinetic data are presented which argue for a direct desaturation of the oleoyl moieties of this oleoyl glycerophosphocholine to linoleoyl moieties. There was no evidence of a subsequent acyltransfer of linoleoyl moieties either to form thioesters or oxygen esters in other complex lipids. The kinetics were also consistent with a functional coupling of the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase with the oleate desaturase. There was little exchange of the oleoyl glycerophosphocholine from the bulk membrane lipid with that newly synthesised by the lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase. Rather, the newly synthesised oleoylglycerophosphocholine seemed to be directly channelled to the vicinity of the desaturase. The results are discussed in the context of 'metabolite channelling'. The consequences for desaturase activity and its regulation are also examined.	0
23540520	Psychometric assessment of the depressive cognition scale among caregivers of persons with autism spectrum disorder. Caregivers of persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are prone to depression, and early identification of cognitive depressive symptoms is important to prevent the development of clinical depression. The Depressive Cognition Scale (DCS) can be used for early detection, but the scale's psychometrics has not been tested in caregivers of persons with ASD. In this study, 95 caregivers of persons with ASD completed the eight-item DCS and measures of caregiver burden and resourcefulness. A Cronbach's alpha of .90 indicated internal consistency. Construct validity was supported by significant correlations with caregiver burden (.59) and resourcefulness (-.57). Principal component factor analysis produced a single factor with 58% of the variance explained. The findings suggest the DCS is useful for early detection of depression in caregivers of persons with ASD.	0
10454995	Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication and repair proteins: proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Schizosaccharomyces pombe has a cell cycle progression with distinctive phases that serves as a perfect model system for investigating DNA replication and repair of eukaryotic cells. Here, we use proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) of S. pombe to demonstrate how the function of this protein in both DNA replication and repair can be assessed by genetic and biochemical approaches. We describe a method of introducing site-specific mutations into the fission yeast PCNA gene pcn1(+). The in vivo effects of these pcn1 mutants in a strain with a null pcn1 background are described and their in vitro biochemical properties are characterized. Mutants described here are those that are defective in enhancing processivity of DNA polymerase delta, show temperature-sensitive growth, and have increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU), UV and gamma irradiation, and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Three mutants that show reduced growth rate in vivo and decreased capacity to enhance polymerase delta DNA synthetic activity and processivity in vitro-pcn1-1, pcn1-5, and pcn1-26-are described as examples of using a genetic approach to identify the biochemical function of replication proteins. One cold-sensitive growth allele, pcn1-3, that has a recessive cold-sensitive cdc phenotype and shows sensitivity to HU and UV and gamma irradiation is used as an example of using the genetic approach to reveal the function of replication proteins in repair. The power of combining both biochemical and genetic disciplines is emphasized. Methods for site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro analysis of mutant proteins, and in vivo characterization of mutants in response to UV or gamma irradiation, MMS, HU, and temperature, as well as genetic epistasis are described. Locations of functionally significant residues on the PCNA tertiary structure are summarized.	0
11574707	Measuring resident satisfaction in residential aged care. PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to assess the factor structure, reliability, and validity of an existing Resident Satisfaction Questionnaire (RSQ) and to develop a short-form RSQ for regular use in residential aged care settings. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted to collect the required information, with facilities being selected using stratified random sampling. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a sample of 1,146 residents in 70 residential aged care facilities in Western Australia. RESULTS: The RSQ is confirmed to be a reliable, valid, context-relevant, and easy-to-use instrument for assessing residents' satisfaction with their residential aged care facilities. Resident satisfaction, as assessed via the RSQ, was found to be a multidimensional construct comprising six factors-Room, Home, Social Interaction, Meals Service, Staff Care, and Involvement. IMPLICATIONS: A 24-item short version of the RSQ can be constructed based on the six-factor resident satisfaction measurement model and used as a regular monitoring tool of resident satisfaction for quality improvement purposes.	0
6506067	Consideration of the mechanism of pulmonary adenogenesis in urethane-treated Swiss mice. A number of investigators have observed a quadratic relationship between acute urethane dose and cumulative pulmonary adenoma incidence in mice. The hypothesis was tested that this dose-effect relationship may be explained by consideration of the elimination kinetics of urethane. Single doses of 0.4 to 1.8 mg urethane per g body weight were given ip to 6-week-old Swiss-Cox mice. The measure of internal exposure to the intact urethane molecule for a given external urethane dose was taken to be the area under the curve (AUC alpha) of a blood urethane concentration versus time plot. AUC alpha was linearly related to tumor prevalence. When urethane elimination was induced by pretreatment of the mice with p,p'-DDT, the linear relationship of AUC alpha to tumor prevalence was shifted. Reduction of tumor prevalence by p,p'-DDT pretreatment was more marked than that predicted on the basis of exposure to urethane. Thus, the kinetic evidence is consistent with biochemical evidence from other investigators supporting the premise that activation of urethane to a reactive metabolite is required for adenoma formation in the mouse lung. While exposure to the adenogenic moiety is evidently closely proportional to internal exposure to urethane in both pretreated and non-pretreated mice, p,p'-DDT pretreatment causes a shift in this proportionality.	0

18633213	[Evidence and issues in standardization of intraperitoneal chemotherapy]. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy targets i.p. regional metastasis by maintenance of high-dose intensity. Thus, it is applied for cancers in which i.p. lesions limit the prognosis or QOL of patients. In ovarian cancer, ample evidence to support survival benefit of i.p. chemotherapy has been established, however, its standardization has not yet been accomplished. NCI has made efforts for the dissemination of and education in i.p. therapy, and GOG's research focuses on a less toxic i.p. regimen. In gastric cancer, the advantage of i.p. therapy has not been proved, and for its approval, phase I-III trial of i.p. with or without cytoreduction surgery should be initiated.	0
8861836	Cytogenetic abnormalities in an in situ ductal carcinoma and five prophylactically removed breasts from members of a family with hereditary breast cancer. Short-term cultures of tissue samples from three bilateral prophylactic mastectomies and one in situ ductal carcinoma from four women belonging to a family with hereditary breast cancer were cytogenetically analyzed. Clonal chromosome abnormalities were detected in five of the six prophylactically removed breasts, all of which had the histologic diagnosis epithelial hyperplasia without atypia, and in the in situ carcinoma. The same karyotypic imbalance, a loss of 3p12-14, was detected in the in situ carcinoma as well as in one of the hyperplasias, indicating that these bands may harbor a pathogenetically relevant gene in this breast cancer family. The finding of chromosome aberrations in clonal proportions in the prophylactically removed breasts indicates that a neoplastic process was already present, lending support to the view that prophylactic bilateral mastectomy in these high-risk individuals prevented the development of breast carcinoma.	0

21293879	A dynamic model for genome-wide association studies. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to identify the genetic and environmental etiology of a trait, several key issues related to their statistical power and biological relevance have remained unexplored. Here, we describe a novel statistical approach, called functional GWAS or fGWAS, to analyze the genetic control of traits by integrating biological principles of trait formation into the GWAS framework through mathematical and statistical bridges. fGWAS can address many fundamental questions, such as the patterns of genetic control over development, the duration of genetic effects, as well as what causes developmental trajectories to change or stop changing. In statistics, fGWAS displays increased power for gene detection by capitalizing on cumulative phenotypic variation in a longitudinal trait over time and increased robustness for manipulating sparse longitudinal data.	0

12447795	[Biochemical bases and research in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]. INTRODUCTION: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which is very common among the school aged population. Its core symptoms are inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Currently, three principal subtypes of ADHD are recognized: ADHD predominantly inattentive type, ADHD predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type or ADHD combined type. Affected individuals have increased comorbidity risks, often followed by cognitive, emotional and/or social impairments as adults. Stimulants drugs such methylphenidate (Ritalin) or D amphetamine (Dexedrine) represent the first line drugs for the treatment of ADHD. DEVELOPMENT: The clinical features of ADHD were first described by Dr. George Frederick Still for Lancet in 1902, and in spite of the investigations carried out since then, the precise cause is still not clear. The purpose of this review is to describe recent advances of the neurobiological basis of ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Recent neuroimaging studies in humans indicate a dysfunctions of the frontal striatal circuits in patients with ADHD, which can be improved by pharmacological treatment. Both pre and clinical studies implicate a dysregulation of the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, which are known to regulate the functions of these circuits. More recent evidence indicate that some features of ADHD could be linked to alterations in the posterior inferior vermis. These studies also stress the importance of taking into consideration factors such as age, gender and duration of pharmacological treatment when interpreting the results.	0
11887939	Expression of Hsp70-2 in unilateral cryptorchid testis of rhesus monkey during germ cell apoptosis. We investigated the possible role of Hsp70-2 in germ cell apoptosis induced by heat stress in monkey unilateral cryptorchid testis. The study focused on in situ analysis of the testicular cell DNA fragmentation and on the possible relationship between Hsp70-2 expression and germ cell apoptosis. The TUNEL result showed that most of the germ cells were labeled in the cryptorchid testis on d 5 after induction of cryptorchidism; that with most of the apoptotic germ cells depleted, only a few germ cells were labeled on d 10; and that almost no apoptotic signal was observed in the cryptorchid testis on d 15 and thereafter. This indicates that the increasing germ cell degeneration in cryptorchid testis may take the form of apoptosis. Using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and Northern blot, we examined the changes of Hsp70-2 expression in the monkey cryptorchid testis. The level of Hsp70-2 mRNA decreased slightly, while the expression of HSP70-2 protein was almost unchanged at the early stage of germ cell apoptosis in the cryptorchid testis on d 5 and dropped dramatically along with the loss of apoptotic germ cells in the cryptorchid testis on d 10 after operation. It is therefore suggested that Hsp70-2 might not take part in inhibiting the apoptosis of germ cells at the early stage during operation-induced cryptorchid testis, and that Hsp70-2 gene does not belong to the immediate early related gene responsible for germ cell apoptosis induced by heat stress.	0
22097832	[Determination of acidity and vitamin C in apples using portable NIR analyzer]. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy technology based on a portable NIR analyzer, combined with kernel Isomap algorithm and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) has been applied to establishing quantitative models for prediction of acidity and vitamin C in six kinds of apple samples. The obtained results demonstrated that the fitting and the predictive accuracy of the models with kernel Isomap algorithm were satisfactory. The correlation between actual and predicted values of calibration samples (R(c)) obtained by the acidity model was 0.999 4, and for prediction samples (R(p)) was 0.979 9. The root mean square error of prediction set (RMSEP) was 0.055 8. For the vitamin C model, R(c) was 0.989 1, R(p) was 0.927 2, and RMSEP was 4.043 1. Results proved that the portable NIR analyzer can be a feasible tool for the determination of acidity and vitamin C in apples.	0
6640414	Haemophilus somnus: a comparison among three serological tests and a serological survey in beef and dairy cattle. Serological tests for the detection of antibodies against Haemophilus somnus were carried out in herds of beef and dairy cattle using three different techniques: agglutination, complement fixation and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The agglutination test appeared to detect more seroreactors than the complement fixation and counterimmunoelectrophoresis tests. Results of the three tests indicated that there were more positive reactors in beef cattle and dairy cattle from infected herds than in dairy cattle from clinically normal herds.	0

10187832	Identification of a novel DNA binding site for nuclear orphan receptor OR1. The nuclear orphan receptor OR1 has been shown to bind as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) to direct repeat 4 (DR4) response elements. It remained unclear, however, whether this represents the only or the optimal binding site for this receptor. Therefore, we performed a DNA binding site selection assay that allows the identification of novel DNA binding sites for OR1 in an unbiased manner. While OR1 alone was not able to select a specific sequence from the pool of oligonucleotides, the OR1/RXR heterodimer selected a highly conserved DR1 element, termed DR1s, with two AGGTCA motifs spaced by one adenosine. The functional activity of the consensus binding site was verified in transient transfection assays and corroborated by in vitro studies. Based on the sequence of the consensus DR1s, we located putative natural binding sites in the 5'-promoter flanking regions of the rat S14 gene and the rat cholecystokinin type A receptor gene. Furthermore, we could show that although the OR1/RXR heterodimer has a distinct binding orientation on a DR4 element, it is able to bind in both orientations to the DR1s element. The OR1 paralog LXRalpha does not bind as a heterodimer with RXR to the DR1s element, indicating that these receptors, despite their homology, are involved in the regulation of different sets of genes.	0
23803330	Immediate compensation for variations in self-generated Coriolis torques related to body dynamics and carried objects. We have previously shown that the Coriolis torques that result when an arm movement is performed during torso rotation do not affect movement trajectory. Our purpose in the present study was to examine whether torso motion-induced Coriolis and other interaction torques are counteracted during a turn and reach (T_R) movement when the effective mass of the hand is augmented, and whether the dominant arm has an advantage in coordinating intersegmental dynamics as predicted by the dynamic dominance hypothesis (Sainburg RL. Exp Brain Res 142: 241-258, 2002). Subjects made slow and fast T_R movements in the dark to just extinguished targets with either arm, while holding or not holding a 454-g object. Movement endpoints were equally accurate at both speeds, with either hand, and in both weight conditions, but subjects tended to angularly undershoot and produce more variable endpoints for targets requiring greater torso rotation. There were no changes in endpoint accuracy or trajectory deviation over repeated movements. The dominant right arm was more stable in its control of trajectory direction across targets, whereas the nondominant left arm had an improved ability to stop accurately on the target for higher levels of interaction torques. The trajectories to more eccentric targets were straighter when performed at higher speeds but slightly more deviated when subjects held the weight. Subjects did not slow their torso velocity or change the timing of the arm and torso velocities when holding the weight, although there was a slight decrease in their hand velocity relative to the torso. The delay between the onsets of torso and finger movements was almost twice as large for the right arm than the left, suggesting the right arm was better able to account for torso rotation in the arm movement. Holding the weight increased the peak Coriolis torque by 40% at the shoulder and 45% at the elbow and, for the most eccentric target, increased the peak net torque by 12% at the shoulder and 34% at the elbow. In accordance with Sainburg's dynamic dominance hypothesis, the right arm exhibited an advantage for coordinating intersegmental dynamics, showing a more stable finger velocity in relation to the torso across targets, decreasing error variability with movement speed, and more synchronized peaks of finger relative and torso angular velocities in conditions with greater joint torque requirements. The arm used had little effect on the movement path and the magnitude of the joint torques in any of the conditions. These results indicate that compensations for forthcoming Coriolis torque variations take into account the dynamic properties of the body and of external objects, as well as the planned velocities of the torso and arm.	0
10381188	Ascorbic acid maintenance in HaCaT cells prevents radical formation and apoptosis by UV-B. We have investigated the enzymatic reduction and accumulation of vitamin C in HaCaT epithelial cells. The subcellular localization and the activities of ascorbyl free radical reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase showed that mitochondrial, microsomal and plasma membranes fractions express high levels of ascorbyl free radical reductase activity, whereas dehydroascorbate reductase activity was found at low levels only in the post microsomal supernatant. We have also investigated cell proliferation and vitamin C accumulation induced by ascorbic acid 2-phosphate. This derivative caused no inhibition of cell growth, was uptaken from the extracellular medium and accumulated as ascorbic acid in mM concentrations. These results show that HaCaT cells possess very efficient systems to maintain high levels of both intracellular and extracellular ascorbic acid. The regeneration and uptake of ascorbic acid from extracellular medium contributes to the intracellular antioxidant capacity, as evaluated by 2',7'-dihydrodichlorofluorescein staining. Consequently, cells became more resistant to free radical generation and cell death induced by UV-B irradiation.	0
21454075	Biological evaluation of 3'-O-alkylated analogs of salacinol, the role of hydrophobic alkyl group at 3' position in the side chain on the a-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Four analogs with 3'-O-alkyl groups (9a: CH(3), 9b: C(2)H(5), 9c: C(13)H(27) or 9d: CH(2)Ph) instead of the 3'-O-sulfate anion in salacinol (1), a naturally occurring potent a-glucosidase inhibitor, were synthesized by the coupling reaction of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-epithio-d-arabinitols (18a and 18b) with appropriate epoxides (10a-10d). These analogs showed equal or considerably higher inhibitory activity against rat small intestinal a-glucosidases than the original sulfate (1), and one of them (9d) was found more potent than currently used a-glucosidase inhibitors as antidiabetics. Thus, introduction of a hydrophobic moiety at the C3' position of this new class of inhibitor was found beneficial for onset of stronger inhibition against these enzymes.	0
22430815	Ovarian fluid of receptive females enhances sperm velocity. The females of several internal fertilizers are able to store sperm for a long time, reducing the risk of sperm limitation. However, it also means that males can attempt to mate outside females' receptive period, potentially increasing the level of sperm competition and exacerbating sexual conflict over mating. The guppy (Poecilia reticulata), an internally fertilizing fish, is a model system of such competition and conflict. Female guppies accept courtship and mate consensually only during receptive periods of the ovarian cycle but receive approximately one (mostly forced) mating attempt per minute both during and outside their sexually receptive phase. In addition, females can store viable sperm for months. We expected that guppy females would disfavour sperm received during their unreceptive period, possibly by modulating the quality and/or quantity of the components present in the ovarian fluid (OF) over the breeding cycle. Ovarian fluid has been shown to affect sperm velocity, a determinant of sperm competition success in this and other fishes. We found that in vitro sperm velocity is slower in OF collected from unreceptive females than in OF from receptive females. Visual stimulation with a potential partner prior to collection did not significantly affect in vitro sperm velocity. These results suggest that sperm received by unreceptive females may be disfavoured as sperm velocity likely affects the migration process and the number of sperm that reach storage sites.	0
8251575	Macrophage activation: a riddle of immunological resistance. Various lines of defense against infection are present in all living creatures. The balance between symbiosis and parasitism is determined by the mechanisms through which the host resists infection and by the extent of injury induced by the parasite: both factors contribute to disease. Lines of host defense can be arbitrarily divided into three components: 1) barrier functions of skin and mucous membranes and their innate physical and secretory antimicrobial components; 2) elements of host defense that do not necessarily require prior exposure to an infectious agent or immunologic memory (mast cells, granulocytes, macrophages, NK cells, gamma/delta T cells); and 3) immune responses directed against specific epitopes on the infectious agent induced by prior exposure and immunologic memory (alpha/beta T cells, B cells). Analysis of such host defense mechanisms repeatedly documents tremendous redundancy and overlap between these lines of defense. Further, there is open communication, so that a change at any one level ripples throughout the system. Acquired nonspecific resistance to infection is an example of such a ripple. Host response to one infection alerts the immune system, so that the general level of resistance to other infectious agents is increased. This response is initiated by an immune response (third line of defense) but effected by nonspecific elements (second line of defense). The survival value of such responses is obvious. There are numerous examples in both mouse and man of the operation of these systems in response to infection. Further, the menus of antimicrobial components available to both mouse and man for resistance to infection are very similar, but not identical. Indeed, it is said that the genetic basis for differences between mice and man revolve around a difference of less than 10% in DNA sequences. But there are differences! Mouse macrophages produce IFN-beta in response to infection, human cells produce IFN-alpha. Mouse macrophages effect antimicrobial activity principally through induction of NO synthase and the generation of toxic nitrogen oxides. This pathway has yet to be described with human macrophages. In both man and mouse, F. tularensis is an obligate intracellular parasite of macrophages that requires an essential component provided by the cell for its replication. That mouse and man are not so different is well illustrated by the effector mechanisms induced by IFN-gamma for antimicrobial activity against F. tularensis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	0
26314965	NKX6.3 controls gastric differentiation and tumorigenesis. UNASSIGNED: NKX6.3 transcription factor is known to be an important regulator in gastric mucosal epithelial differentiation. The present study aimed to investigate whether NKX6.3 acts as an essential tumor suppressor in gastric carcinogenesis. Absent or reduced protein expression and decreased DNA copy number and mRNA transcript of the NKX6.3 gene were frequently observed in gastric cancers. Overexpression of NKX6.3 in AGSNKX6.3 and MKN1NKX6.3 cells markedly arrested cell proliferation by inhibiting cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis through both death receptor- and mitochondrial-pathways. In addition, stable NKX6.3 transfectants increased the expression of gastric differentiation markers, including SOX2 and Muc5ac, and decreased the expression of intestinal differentiation markers, CDX2 and Muc2. In ChIP-cloning and sequencing analyses, NKX6.3 coordinated a repertoire of target genes, some of which are clearly associated with cell cycle, differentiation and death. In particular, NKX6.3 transcriptional factor was found to bind specifically to the upstream sequences of GKN1, a gastric-specific tumor suppressor, and dramatically increase expression of the latter. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between NKX6.3 and GKN1 expression in non-cancerous gastric mucosae. Thus, these data suggest that NKX6.3 may control the fate of gastric mucosal cells and function as a gastric tumor suppressor.	1
22382988	Placebo effect model in asthma clinical studies: longitudinal meta-analysis of forced expiratory volume in 1 second. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe the time course of the placebo effect in asthma and quantitatively investigate the affective factors of the placebo effect for the placebo response simulation during the asthma clinical study design. METHODS: We conducted a systemic search of public data sources for the study-level forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) to build the placebo effect model for studies by oral or inhaled administrations simultaneously. The administration routes, types of inhalation device, mean patient age, mean male proportion, baseline FEV(1), disease severity, year of publication, inhaled corticosteroid status during the treatment, and dropout rate were tested as covariates. RESULTS: There are 34 literature sources containing 178 mean values for FEV(1) presenting the individual observations from about 3,703 patients. The exponential models adequately described the time course of placebo effect with the typical value of the maximum placebo effect (P(max)) of 0.060 L. Dropout rate incorporated in the residual error model and the disease severity (mild to moderate and moderate to severe) at baseline were covariates that remained in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: The placebo effect is adequately described by an exponential model over time. By incorporating the dropout rate in the residual error model, the estimation precision was improved. The model could predict the placebo response profile in mild to severe asthmatic patients for the asthma clinical study design and could also be a structure model of the placebo effect for the pure drug effect evaluation in the asthma clinical trials.	0

12725023	[Psychological interventions and their immune consequences]. Psychoneuroimmunology is a new tendency in science which integrates medicine and social sciences. An interdisciplinary point of view on the etiology and treatment of many diseases fortifies the empirically holistic conception which is very old in medicine. The disease is the result of the collapse of the defensive mechanisms in stress. The nervous, hormonal and immune systems are integrated. The social environment and stress influence the individual's personality and cause diseases, frequently cause immunosuppression. Psychotherapy can \"wake\" up the immune system. The results of research in psychoneuroimmunology are particular significance for psychosomatic medicine since they explain in a systemic way the earlier clinical observations and scientific studies concerning the influence of stress on the health condition. Studies of the immune system conditioning and the influence of this the relaxation training on this function are very important in coping with the disease.	0

24465797	The rapid growth of fibroids during early pregnancy. Several studies aimed to disentangle whether pregnancy influences the growth of uterine fibroids but results were inconsistent. In this study, we speculated that fibroid enlargement during pregnancy may not be linear and we hypothesized that this phenomenon may mainly occur during initial pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, we set up a prospective cohort study of women with fibroids undergoing IVF. Cases were women achieving a viable pregnancy. Controls were the subsequent women with fibroids but failing to become pregnant. Twenty-five cases and 25 controls were recruited. The total number of fibroids in the two groups was 46 and 41, respectively. The mean    SD diameter of the fibroids was 17    10 and 20    11 mm, respectively (p = 0.18). A statistically significant enlargement emerged exclusively in pregnant women. The median (Interquartile Range) modification of the diameter of the lesions in cases and controls was +34% (+6%/+65%) and +2% (-6%/+12%), respectively (p<0.001). The median (Interquartile Range) modification of the volume of the lesions was +140% (+23%/+357%) and 0% (-18%/+37%), respectively (p<0.001). In pregnant women, we failed to document any significant correlation between the magnitude of the growth and ovarian responsiveness to hyper-stimulation, suggesting that steroids hormones are not the unique factors involved. In conclusion, fibroids undergo a rapid and remarkable growth during initial pregnancy. Reasons behind this phenomenon remain to be clarified. The early rise in steroids hormones during early pregnancy may not be sufficient to explain the process. Other pregnancy-related hormones and proteins may play also key roles.	0

11934414	Slide track analysis of the relative motion between femoral head and acetabular cup in walking and in hip simulators. Joint simulators are important tools in wear studies of prosthetic joint materials. The type of motion in a joint simulator is crucial with respect to the wear produced. It is widely accepted that only multidirectional motion yields realistic wear for polyethylene acetabular cups. Multidirectionality, however, is a wide concept. The type of multidirectional motion varies considerably between simulators, which may explain the large differences in observed wear rates. At present, little is known about the relationship between the type of multidirectional motion and wear. One illustrative way to compare the motions of various hip simulators is to compute tracks made on the counterface by selected points of the surface of the femoral head and acetabular cup due to the cyclic relative motion. A new computation method, based on Euler angles, was developed, and used to compute slide tracks for the three-axis motion of the hip joint in walking, and for two hip simulators, the HUT-3 and the biaxial rocking motion. The slide track patterns resulting from the gait waveforms were found to be similar to those produced by the HUT-3 simulator. This paper is the first to include a verification of the computed simulator tracks. The tracks were verified in the two simulators using sharp pins, embedded in acetabular cups, engraving distinct grooves onto the femoral heads. The engravings were identical to the computed tracks. The results clearly differed from earlier computations by another research group. This study is intended to start a thorough investigation of the relationship between the type of multidirectional motion and wear.	0
19369487	Early- and late-onset inherited erythromelalgia: genotype-phenotype correlation. Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severe burning pain in response to mild warmth, has been shown to be caused by gain-of-function mutations of sodium channel Na(v)1.7 which is preferentially expressed within dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and sympathetic ganglion neurons. Almost all physiologically characterized cases of IEM have been associated with onset in early childhood. Here, we report the voltage-clamp and current-clamp analysis of a new Na(v)1.7 mutation, Q10R, in a patient with clinical onset of erythromelalgia in the second decade. We show that the mutation in this patient hyperpolarizes activation by only -5.3 mV, a smaller shift than seen with early-onset erythromelalgia mutations, but similar to that of I136V, another mutation that is linked to delayed-onset IEM. Using current-clamp, we show that the expression of Q10R induces hyperexcitability in DRG neurons, but produces an increase in excitability that is smaller than the change produced by I848T, an early-onset erythromelalgia mutation. Our analysis suggests a genotype-phenotype relationship at three levels (clinical, cellular and molecular/ion channel), with mutations that produce smaller effects on sodium channel activation being associated with a smaller degree of DRG neuron excitability and later onset of clinical signs.	0
15238074	Interleukin-2, but not interleukin-15, is required to terminate experimentally induced clonal T-cell anergy. It has been demonstrated that T cells stimulated with nucleosome-polyomavirus T-antigen (self-nonself) complexes, but not nucleosomes, activate autoimmune nucleosome-specific T cells. As these cells may be na  ve, such observations do not show that anergic T cells are reactivated. To understand the regulation of autoimmunity, this is important to assess, and this is the focus of this study. T-cell anergy was induced by antigen stimulation in the presence of antibodies to the costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86. Requirements for the reactivation of anergic T cells were analysed by the ability of antigen and interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-15 to increase T-cell proliferation and IL-2 transcription. Data demonstrate that stimulation of T cells with T-antigen and anti-CD80/86 antibodies promotes long-lasting clonal T-cell anergy. While T-antigen did not reactivate anergic T cells, proliferation and upregulation of IL-2 gene transcription was initiated by stimulation with antigen, costimulation and IL-2 added to the cultures. Proliferation per se was not sufficient to promote the reactivation of anergic T cells, as both IL-2 and IL-15 induced proliferation, while antigen and IL-2, but not IL-15, upregulated IL-2 mRNA levels. These data demonstrate that the innate immune system and IL-2 are central to the initiation and termination of T-cell anergy.	0

17945545	Identification of the antitumoral drug emodin binding sites in bovine serum albumin by spectroscopic methods. Using SERS, fluorescence, circular dichroism and stopped-flow, we have unequivocally characterized the binding sites of emodin in bovine serum albumin. Emodin interacts with protein through two different binding sites corresponding to Sudlow's sites 1 and 2. Site 2, where the binding drug presents, in the cavity, a form between neutral and mono-anionic species slightly displaced to the neutral one, is the primary interaction site, with higher association binding constant, and hence, higher affinity than the other binding site. This interaction changes considerably the alpha-helical content of the protein and it occurs mainly within the interval [emodin]/[protein] < or = 2.0. The process involves a fast reaction and the observed rate constant increases when increasing the [emodin]/[protein] ratio. The secondary emodin interaction site corresponds to the Sudlow's site 1, where the drug shows a similar form to that deduced for site 2, but in this case, it is more displaced to mono-anionic species. This interaction does not change the alpha-helical content of bovine serum albumin, and it occurs mainly for [emodin]/[protein] > 2.0 ratios, the process implies a slower reaction than the union process to the site 2, with an observed rate constant that is invariable within the studied interval.	0

15142664	Consciousness is discontinuous: the perception of continuity requires conscious vectors and needs to be balanced with creativity. Consciousness is not what it appears to be. While we are awake and alert, consciousness appears to be continuous, but actually is broken up into discrete intervals. The perception of continuity is critical for cognitive performance, linking together an otherwise disparate collection of thoughts. The perception requires an understanding of how information changes and evolves between conscious intervals. This understanding is analogous to the vectors used by the visual system to add motion to otherwise still images. Determining conscious vectors, however, is much more complex than determining motion vectors and presumably strains cognitive resources. This strain, in turn, limits the ability to bring in new information and ideas, creating a tradeoff between continuity and creativity. Optimizing this tradeoff may provide significant benefits both for common mental tasks and serious neurological conditions.	0
7594509	Evidence for superantigen involvement in cardiovascular injury due to Kawasaki syndrome. Kawasaki syndrome (KS), the major cause of acquired heart disease in children, is an acute multisystem vasculitis frequently associated with the development of myocarditis and coronary artery abnormalities. Despite the widely held belief that KS is an infectious disease, its etiology has remained elusive. Recently, we and others have reported the selective expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in the peripheral blood of most patients in the acute, but not in the convalescent, phase of KS. These data were consistent with the concept that this illness is triggered by a bacterial superantigen. We report here that a patient who died of acute KS had selective expansion of V beta 2+ T cells in her myocardium and coronary artery. Sequence analysis of TCR beta-chain genes of V beta 2+ T cells from the myocardium showed extensive junctional region diversity. These observations, along with the demonstration of V beta 2 expansion in both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, support the concept that the activation of infiltrating V beta 2+ T cells are involved in the cardiovascular damage associated with KS.	0
22716022	In pursuit of homoleptic actinide alkyl complexes. This Forum Article describes the pursuit of isolable homoleptic actinide alkyl complexes, starting with the pioneering work of Gilman during the Manhattan project. The initial reports in this area suggested that homoleptic uranium alkyls were too unstable to be isolated, but Wilkinson demonstrated that tractable uranium alkyls could be generated by purposeful \"ate\" complex formation, which serves to saturate the uranium coordination sphere and provide the complexes with greater kinetic stability. More recently, we reported the solid-state molecular structures of several homoleptic uranium alkyl complexes, including [Li(THF)4][U(CH2(t)Bu)5], [Li(TMEDA)]2[UMe6], [K(THF)]3[K(THF)2][U(CH2Ph)6]2, and [Li(THF)4][U(CH2SiMe3)6], by employing Wilkinson's strategy. Herein, we describe our attempts to extend this chemistry to thorium. The treatment of ThCl4(DME)2 with 5 equiv of LiCH2(t)Bu or LiCH2SiMe3 at -25   C in THF affords [Th(CH2(t)Bu)5] (1) and [Li(DME)2][Th(CH2SiMe3)5 (2), respectively, in moderate yields. Similarly, the treatment of ThCl4(DME)2 with 6 equiv of K(CH2Ph) produces [K(THF)]2[Th(CH2Ph)6] (3), in good yield. Complexes 1-3 have been fully characterized, while the structures of 1 and 3 were confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Additionally, the electronic properties of 1 and 3 were explored by density functional theory.	0

10915842	The effect of SK-896 on post-operative ileus in dogs: gastrointestinal motility pattern and transit. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SK-896 (Phe-Val-Pro-Ile-Phe-Thr-Try-Gly-Glu-Leu-Gln-Arg-Leu-Gln-Glu-Lys-Glu- Arg-Asn-Lys-Gly-Gln-Hse), a new motilin analogue, on gastrointestinal motility and transit in dogs with post-operative ileus, and to compare the effects of this agent on these parameters with the effects of prostaglandin F(2alpha), a well-known gastroprokinetic agent. We used chronically implanted force transducers to measure motility and radiography of radio-opaque markers to measure transit. Infusion of SK-896 1 microgram/kg/h, for 20 min twice a day induced interdigestive migrating contractions-like motility. Infusion of prostaglandin F(2alpha), 20 microgram/kg/h, for 1 h twice a day induced continuous contractions in the distal part of the small intestine. The time of first appearance of interdigestive migrating contractions in the stomach (gastric-interdigestive migrating contractions) and the gastric emptying time of the solid marker with the administration of SK-896 were significantly less than those noted with the administration of prostaglandin F(2alpha). It appears that gastric-interdigestive migrating contractions play an important role in the transit of substances, especially solid substances, in the gastrointestinal tract. We conclude that SK-896, which induced gastric-interdigestive migrating contractions, is effective to induce early recovery from post-operative ileus.	0

10424392	LLC-PK1 cells as a model system to study proximal tubule transport of water and other compounds relevant for renal stone disease. LLC-PK1 cells were cultured on a permeable support in a two-compartment culture system. Confluent monolayers received an ultrafiltrate-like solution at the apical side and a plasma-like solution at the basolateral side. The distribution of various solutes, including phosphate, calcium, and oxalate over both compartments was measured in time. The transport of water was monitored by alterations in fluid concentrations of radiolabeled inulin. Bicarbonate, glucose, and phosphate were transported rapidly from the apical to basolateral side of the monolayer. Sodium and chloride were reabsorbed without major consequences for the osmolality in the apical and basal fluid. Calcium and potassium were also reabsorbed, but to a smaller extent than sodium. The luminal concentration of oxalate gradually increased to values that were at least three times higher (12.0+/-0.4 micromol/l) than those in the contraluminal fluid (3.8+/-0.1 micromol/l). However, since the luminal rise of oxalate completely matched the rise of inulin in the apical fluid this appeared to be the passive consequence of active water reabsorption rather than of net directed oxalate transport. The LLC-PK1 model could prove useful to study the regulation of proximal tubule water transport and its effect on luminal stone salt concentrations under different physiological conditions.	0

16792563	Detection of maternal alcohol use problems in the pediatric emergency department. BACKGROUND: Maternal alcohol use problems may impact the health and well-being of children, but often remain unrecognized. Mothers of young children seldom seek outpatient care for themselves; thus, pediatric settings may present an opportunity for the detection of maternal alcohol use problems. This study examines the feasibility of screening for and prevalence of alcohol use problems in mothers of young children in the context of seeking pediatric emergency care. We also examined the relationship of maternal alcohol use problems with use of pediatric emergency care. METHODS: A total of 361 English-speaking mothers of children aged 7 and younger completed screening measures during their child's emergency care visit. TWEAK was used to screen for alcohol use problems. The screening survey also included information on children's health status and health care use, demographics, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. RESULTS: Of the women approached, 90% agreed to complete the screening measure. On the basis of cutoff score of 2 or more, 7% of women had elevated TWEAK scores. Those women with a TWEAK score > 2 reported greater use of the pediatric emergency department (PED) than women scoring below the cutoff. On the basis of multivariate analyses, significant predictors of recent PED use included the presence of child chronic illness, younger maternal age, and TWEAK score. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for alcohol use problems among mothers of young children using the TWEAK appears to be feasible in a busy PED setting. The PED setting is promising for identifying risk drinking among women who may be less likely to be otherwise detected and for whom alcohol use may be impacting child outcomes.	0
16432164	Enhancement of DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor-induced apoptosis by ursodeoxycholic acid. Certain hydrophobic bile acids, including deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, exert toxic effects not only in the liver but also in the intestine. Moreover, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which has protective actions against apoptosis in the liver, may have both protective and toxic effects in the intestine. The goal of the present study was to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the toxic effect of UDCA in intestinal HT-29 cells. Here, we show that UDCA potentiated both phosphatidylserine externalization and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by SN-38, the most potent metabolite of the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, CPT-11. Furthermore, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as well as mitochondrial membrane permeability transition induced by SN-38 was enhanced in the presence of UDCA, resulting in an increased lethality determined by colony-forming assay. This UDCA-induced increased apoptosis was not due to alteration of either intracellular accumulation of SN-38 or cell cycle arrest by SN-38. The increased apoptosis was best observed when UDCA was present after SN-38 stimulation and was independent of caspase-8 but dependent on caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, UDCA enhanced SN-38-induced c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation. In conclusion, UDCA increases the apoptotic effects while decreasing the necrotic effects of SN-38 when added after the topoisomerase I inhibitor, showing potential clinical relevance as far as targeted cell death and improved wound healing are concerned. However, the use of this bile acid as an enhancer in antitumor chemotherapy should be further evaluated clinically.	0
19060642	Can nurses impact patient outcomes using a patient-centered care model? OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine if nurses, using patient-centered care (PCC), affect patient satisfaction, perceptions of nursing care, and quality outcomes. BACKGROUND: The Institute of Medicine proposed PCC as 1 of 6 national quality aims, whereas the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services highlighted integration of PCC as 1 of 12 actions for quality improvement. METHODS: A total of 116 patients were randomized into an intervention (PCC) or control group. Patients who were to receive PCC were called before admission and cared for by nurses who trained to administer/practice PCC. Control patients received usual care. Both groups completed questionnaires and received postdischarge calls. Length of stay, falls, infections, and adverse events were measured to assess quality of care. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between groups for length of stay, infection, falls, postoperative complications, quality of care, satisfaction level, or perceptions of nursing care. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-centered care did not affect patient's level of satisfaction or quality of care. However, findings yielded clinically relevant results regarding patient/staff responses.	0
23603510	Apelin-APJ signaling is a critical regulator of endothelial MEF2 activation in cardiovascular development. RATIONALE: The peptide ligand apelin and its receptor APJ constitute a signaling pathway with numerous effects on the cardiovascular system, including cardiovascular development in model organisms such as xenopus and zebrafish. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the embryonic lethal phenotype of the Apj-/- mice and to define the involved downstream signaling targets. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the first characterization of the embryonic lethality of the Apj-/- mice. More than half of the expected Apj-/- embryos died in utero because of cardiovascular developmental defects. Those succumbing to early embryonic death had markedly deformed vasculature of the yolk sac and the embryo, as well as poorly looped hearts with aberrantly formed right ventricles and defective atrioventricular cushion formation. Apj-/- embryos surviving to later stages demonstrated incomplete vascular maturation because of a deficiency of vascular smooth muscle cells and impaired myocardial trabeculation and ventricular wall development. The molecular mechanism implicates a novel, noncanonical signaling pathway downstream of apelin-APJ involving Ga13, which induces histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 and HDAC5 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation, resulting in activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2. Apj-/- mice have greater endocardial Hdac4 and Hdac5 nuclear localization and reduced expression of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcriptional target Kr  ppel-like factor 2. We identify a number of commonly shared transcriptional targets among apelin-APJ, Ga13, and MEF2 in endothelial cells, which are significantly decreased in the Apj-/- embryos and endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a novel role for apelin-APJ signaling as a potent regulator of endothelial MEF2 function in the developing cardiovascular system.	0
6941044	Soft-tissue necrosis induced by extravasated cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The inadvertent extravasation of anticancer drugs in clinical use may result in the development of indolent lesions at the site of injection. Investigation of this phenomenon in Hartley guinea pigs showed that the pathogenesis was based on direct tissue toxicity and not on sensitization. The risk of a serious reaction appeared to be related to the localization of the injurious agent within the dermis rather than at the subcutaneous site.	0
23663907	[HTA-Perspective: Challenges in the early assessment of new oncological drugs]. Oncologic drug therapies have gained wide attention in the context of health policy priority setting for serious and socially significant diseases with high human and monetary costs. Due to uncertainties and scepticism about the actual therapeutic importance of newly approved oncology products, an early assessment programme was already established in Austria in 2007. The assessment of new oncology products is thereby faced with special challenges, since study populations are frequently not representative or the study design is laid out in such a manner that a definitive assessment of patient-relevant endpoints is not possible (cross-overs after interim assessments, surrogate parameters as primary endpoints, uncontrolled studies or those with unrealistic comparators, invalidated post-hoc identified biomarkers). On account of these major uncertainties, even the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is already contemplating multi-stage, \"adaptive\" approvals, and national reimbursement institutions are increasingly working with outcome-oriented, conditional reimbursement.

20135994	[Spatial-temporal variation of soil organic carbon and its relations to soil physical properties in degraded alpine grasslands]. By using grid sampling method, the spatial-temporal variation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its relations to soil physical properties in degraded alpine grasslands in North Tibet were studied. The SOC content and its density both in surface (0-10 cm) and in subsurface (10-20 cm) layers decreased in order of slightly degraded grassland > normal grassland > moderately degraded grasslands > seriously degraded grasslands, and the differences of SOC content and its density between the two layers showed the same variation trend. An opposite trend was observed in the annual variation rates of SOC content and its density in different grasslands, and the variation was larger in surface than in subsurface layer. The annual accumulation rate of SOC in 0-10 cm layer in not degraded and slightly degraded grasslands was 0.018 and 0.003 g x kg(-1), being 6.0 and 2.0 times of that in 10-20 cm layer, while the annual loss rate of SOC in 0-10 cm layer in moderately and seriously degraded grasslands was 0.150 and 0.231 g x kg(-1), being 2.3 and 2.2 times of that in 10-20 cm layer, respectively. The total annual loss of SOC in moderately and seriously degraded grasslands was 3.8 times of the total annual accumulation of SOC in not degraded and slightly degraded grasslands. The degraded alpine grasslands in North Tibet had an average annual SOC loss of 7.87 x 10(7) t C x a(-1), and a greater potential to further loss in the future. The SOC content was significantly positively correlated with the contents of 5.0-1.0 mm, 1.0-0.5 mm, and 0.5-0.25 mm soil aggregates, soil bulk density, and soil moisture content.	0

22674617	Chronic renal failure in lithium-using geriatric patients: effects of lithium continuation versus discontinuation--a 60-month retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: Lithium remains an important treatment in bipolar disorder. Although lithium is often discontinued because of signs of renal failure, it is unclear if this alters the course of renal function in the majority of patients. We hypothesize that in geriatric patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), who have a high burden of medical illness, lithium continuation does not significantly impact renal function (glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of tertiary-care geriatric psychiatry outpatients with a history of lithium use and evidence of CRF (eGFR  <= 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 on >=  2 occasions in >=  3 months). The 27 patients who met these criteria were divided into lithium 'continuers' (continued use >=  2 years following CRF) and 'discontinuers'. Mean eGFR and creatinine were followed at 21 and 60 months after developing CRF. RESULTS: Mean serum eGFR and creatinine were not significantly different between groups at any time during follow-up. When comparing renal function at 60 months to baseline, a trend towards increased creatinine was seen in continuers (p = 0.06) but not in discontinuers. Changes in eGFR in continuers and discontinuers after 60 months did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.35 and 0.98). However, clinically important decreases in eGFR occurred in the majority of continuers but in none of the discontinuers. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend towards declining renal function in lithium continuers at 60-month follow-up. Future prospective longitudinal studies will be needed to confirm our findings. We suggest vigilance and close monitoring of renal function when continuing CRF patients on lithium for extended periods.	0
23990758	Polder effects on sediment-to-soil conversion: water table, residual available water capacity, and salt stress interdependence. The French Atlantic marshlands, reclaimed since the Middle Age, have been successively used for extensive grazing and more recently for cereal cultivation from 1970. The soils have acquired specific properties which have been induced by the successive reclaiming and drainage works and by the response of the clay dominant primary sediments, that is, structure, moisture, and salinity profiles. Based on the whole survey of the Marais Poitevin and Marais de Rochefort and in order to explain the mechanisms of marsh soil behavior, the work focuses on two typical spots: an undrained grassland since at least 1964 and a drained cereal cultivated field. The structure-hydromechanical profiles relationships have been established thanks to the clay matrix shrinkage curve. They are confronted to the hydraulic functioning including the fresh-to-salt water transfers and to the recording of tensiometer profiles. The CE1/5 profiles supply the water geochemical and geophysical data by their better accuracy. Associated to the available water capacity calculation they allow the representation of the parallel evolution of the residual available water capacity profiles and salinity profiles according to the plant growing and rooting from the mesophile systems of grassland to the hygrophile systems of drained fields.	0
17329214	Adaptive surround modulation in cortical area MT. Visual motion perception relies on two opposing operations: integration and segmentation. Integration overcomes motion ambiguity in the visual image by spatial pooling of motion signals, whereas segmentation identifies differences between adjacent moving objects. For visual motion area MT, previous investigations have reported that stimuli in the receptive field surround, which do not elicit a response when presented alone, can nevertheless modulate responses to stimuli in the receptive field center. The directional tuning of this \"surround modulation\" has been found to be mainly antagonistic and hence consistent with segmentation. Here, we report that surround modulation in area MT can be either antagonistic or integrative depending upon the visual stimulus. Both types of modulation were delayed relative to response onset. Our results suggest that the dominance of antagonistic modulation in previous MT studies was due to stimulus choice and that segmentation and integration are achieved, in part, via adaptive surround modulation.	0
23221872	Low major histocompatibility complex diversity in the Tasmanian devil predates European settlement and may explain susceptibility to disease epidemics. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is at risk of extinction owing to the emergence of a contagious cancer known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). The emergence and spread of DFTD has been linked to low genetic diversity in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We examined MHC diversity in historical and ancient devils to determine whether loss of diversity is recent or predates European settlement in Australia. Our results reveal no additional diversity in historical Tasmanian samples. Mainland devils had common modern variants plus six new variants that are highly similar to existing alleles. We conclude that low MHC diversity has been a feature of devil populations since at least the Mid-Holocene and could explain their tumultuous history of population crashes.	0
19291701	Natural Treg cells spontaneously differentiate into pathogenic helper cells in lymphopenic conditions. Induction of Forkhead-box p3 (Foxp3) expression in developing T cells upon peptide-MHC encountering has been proposed to define a lineage of committed Treg cells. However, sustained expression of Foxp3 is required for Treg function and what maintains Foxp3 expression in peripheral Treg remains obscure. To address this issue, we monitored natural Treg phenotype and function upon adoptive transfer into lymphocyte-deficient mice. We first show that about 50% of Foxp3-GFP(+) Treg isolated from Foxp3(gfp) KI animals loose Foxp3 expression in severe lymphopenic conditions. We next evidence that the cytokine IL-2, either produced by co-transferred conventional T cells or administrated i.v. prevents Foxp3 downregulation. Moreover, we document that Treg that lost Foxp3 expression upon adoptive transfer produce IL-2 are not suppressive and promote tissue infiltration and damage upon secondary transfer into alymphoid mice. Our findings that Treg convert into pathogenic Th cells in absence of IL-2 provide new clues to the success of Treg-based immune therapies.	0
10515403	International variations in asthma treatment compliance: the results of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS). Noncompliance to medication is a major barrier to effective asthma management. Its real extent and geographical variation throughout the world are not yet known. The data on compliance, collected in the framework of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) on 1771 subjects (aged 20-44 yrs) with current asthma identified in 14 countries, offer a unique opportunity to assess the extent of noncompliance and its variation across countries. The median percentage of current asthmatics who had received a medical prescription at least once was 95%. The compliance of those patients who had received a medical prescription was found to be low in all countries (median 67%) but with wide variations, the rate ranging from 40% (USA) to 78% (Iceland). During exacerbations patients' rate of compliance increased to 72%. Age was the only variable which influenced compliance to treatment. A significant, although weak, negative correlation was found between patients' compliance and rate of hospital casualty department or emergency room admissions. This study documents that compliance to the treatment of asthma is poor worldwide and that there are large variations between countries. These results emphasize the necessity for further efforts to improve patients' education and to promulgate the international guidelines.	0
16382988	Autoimmune gastritis. A clinicopathologic study of 25 cases. The histopathological diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis (AG) in its early stages can be a diagnostic challenge. Even some advanced cases with complete atrophy of the corpus mucosa may be difficult to recognize. To establish the diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis, several histological features should be assessed and combined with immunostains for enterochromaffin cell-like (ECL) cells and G-cells. The main histological criteria include a mononuclear infiltrate within the lamina propria, foci of destruction of oxyntic glands, intestinal metaplasia (IM), pyloric metaplasia, and parietal cell pseudohypertrophy. These criteria were evaluated in our series of 25 patients with achlorhydria and/or megaloblastic anemia. Some of our patients presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms. The age ranged between 46 and 79 years; one male patient was only 31 years old. Histologically, the corpus mucosa displayed in all cases chronic inflammation with focal complete IM and advanced pyloric metaplasia. In 4 patients, oxyntic glands were destructed in some sites. There was a pancreatic metaplasia of acinar type in 2 patients and a minimal focal pseudohypertrophy of parietal cells in the 31-year-old man. A tubular adenoma with a low-grade dysplasia was found in one female patient. Immunohistochemically, chromogranin-A highlighted linear or nodular hyperplasia of ECL cells in 19 patients, and adenomatoid ECL hyperplasia in one case (80%). In the remaining cases hyperplasia of ECL cells could not be recognized from their normal count. In 13 cases (52%) a few ECL cells were seen also in IM. Regarding associated pathology, in one woman with nodular ECL cell hyperplasia, a gastric carcinoid was removed endoscopically. The reaction with gastrin antibody revealed in 11 cases (44%) a small number of G cells in IM in the corpus mucosa. In 18 patients, antral mucosa was examined as well. In 8 patients, the mucosa was normal; in 10 cases, a mild chronic inactive gastritis was diagnosed, and in 15 patients G-cell hyperplasia was found. In accordance with other studies, we show that the diagnosis of AG may be established microscopically in endoscopic specimens of the gastric body mucosa when histologic features and immunohistochemical detection of ECL and G cell hyperplasia are combined.	0

18339446	A comparison of observed versus documented physician assessment and treatment of pain: the physician record does not reflect the reality. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The Joint Commission requires \"appropriate assessment\" of patients presenting with painful conditions. Compliance is usually assessed through retrospective chart analysis. We investigate the discrepancy between observed physician pain assessment and that subsequently documented in the medical record. METHODS: This was an observational study using a trained investigator watching bedside interactions of emergency physicians. Using a priori definitions, the investigator recorded whether the patient volunteered the presence of pain, physician inquiry about pain, attempts to quantify the pain, treatment offered/rendered, and any assessment of the response to therapy. An independent investigator subsequently assessed the patient's chart for documentation of pain assessment, therapy rendered, and response to treatment. Children younger than 5 years and patients with major trauma, altered mental status, or nontraumatic chest pain were excluded. The institutional review board approved the protocol, the physicians agreed to participate in an \"ergonomic study\" without knowing the exact nature of data collection, and patients released their records. RESULTS: The investigator observed 209 patient encounters. Physicians acknowledged the patients' pain 98.1% of the time but documented its presence in 91.7%. Physicians attempted to quantify the patient's pain in 61.5% of encounters but documented that attempt in only 38.9%. Treatment was offered in 79.9% and recorded in 31.7% of charts. When treatment was offered, the patient's response to the therapy was recorded only 28% of the time. CONCLUSION: Physicians almost always assess and treat patient pain but infrequently record those efforts. The patient's chart is a poor surrogate marker for pain assessment and care by emergency physicians and may not be suitable for use as a compliance assessment tool. Research methodology using retrospective chart analysis may be affected by this phenomenon, suggesting the potential for underestimation of patient pain assessment and treatment by emergency physicians.	0

22115574	Mouse Wee1 gene is repressed by Kr  ppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) via interaction with multiple upstream elements. Wee1 protein kinase represses CDK1 required for G(2)/M transition. The mouse wee1 promoter contains multiple CACCC-boxes between -306 and +1 that can bind to Kr  ppel-like factor 3 (KLF3) transcriptional repressor. We found that increasing amounts of intracellular KLF3 decreased the amount of wee1 mRNA. A promoter reporter assay demonstrated that wee1 promoter activity was repressed by KLF3 overexpression. Elimination of the first and fourth CACCC-boxes suppressed KLF3-governed transcriptional repression. A gel-shift assay demonstrated that KLF3 binds to the first, third, and fourth CACCC-boxes with various strengths. Moreover, KLF3 was suggested to interact with the wee1 regulatory region in a physiological condition. Therefore, we concluded that KLF3 is a transcriptional repressor for wee1 gene. In a previous study, we demonstrated that TBP-like protein (TLP) inhibits wee1 promoter function. In this study, we found that the chromosomal wee1 gene is also down-regulated by KLF3. Since KLF3-repressed wee1 promoter function was further inhibited by TLP overexpression regardless of the inhibition degree of KLF3, we propose that TLP and KLF3 repress wee1 promoter independently.	1

15837534	Protective effect of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system on aging. Experimental studies indicate that chronic long-term inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can prevent most of the deleterious effects due to aging in the cardiovascular system and in the kidney of the normal mouse and rat. In this review, all the information available on this subject provided by several studies performed by our research group during the last years is been described. Treatment was initiated either after weaning or at 12 months of age that is about half the normal life span of the rat. A converting enzyme inhibitor: enalapril or an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker: losartan were used to inhibit the RAS. Cognitive behaviour, emotionality, and locomotor activity were also determined at 10 and 18 months of age in treated since weaning and untreated control rats to elucidate the participation of angiotensin II in memory disfunction. A similar observation was obtained in animals treated from 12 to 18 months of age. Results have demonstrated a significant protective effect on the function and the structure of the cardiovascular system, the kidney and the brain in all the treated animals. Damage observed at 12 months of age was not very significant, but treatment stop further deterioration that was evident in untreated animals. The similarity of the results detected with either enalapril or losartan treatment, clearly indicates that most of the effects are exerted through AT1 receptors. Analysis of the nitric oxide and antioxidant enzymes systems suggest that the protective effect is related to an antioxidant action of the RAS inhibitors and a reduced formation of reactive oxygen species. AngII inhibition might produce changes in the mechanisms of oxidative stress specially at the mitochondrial level. Prevention of mitochondrial decrease and/or damage would be related with the delay of the normal aging process.	0

22541404	Clinical thresholds to egg, hazelnut, milk and peanut: results from a single-center study using standardized challenges. BACKGROUND: Large studies of individual thresholds and risk profiles for foods are sparse. Previous reports indicate that thresholds adjusted for the protein content in foods would be comparable. OBJECTIVE: To establish and compare clinical threshold values for egg, hazelnut, milk and peanut, and correlating them to severity of symptoms. METHODS: Seven hundred eighty-one challenges were performed in 487 patients (age range, 0.5-73.5 years). Using interval censoring survival analysis, the dose distribution of thresholds was fitted to a log-normal function. Symptom score was correlated to thresholds. RESULTS: Based on the 405 challenges resulting in objective signs, similar distribution of thresholds for hazelnut, milk, and peanut challenges were found, whereas individuals with egg allergy were bimodally distributed with a high or a low threshold. Eliciting dose in 10% (95% confidence interval) was 42.9 (24-76.8) mg whole eggs, 133.8 (95.9-186.6) mg whole hazelnut, 106.5 (59.7-190.6) mg roasted peanut, and 2.9 (1.5-5.4) mL milk. Adults showed more severe symptoms and signs than children, and peanut caused more severe reactions than the 3 other foods. CONCLUSION: Thresholds for the different foods were not comparable, and eliciting dose for the 4 foods differed, even if adjusted for protein content. Increasing age but not a low threshold dose is associated with severe symptoms on challenge. Peanuts elicit more severe reactions than the other foods.	0

9407291	Chronology of alveolar healing following immediate implantation of Ricinus communis polyurethane resin: histometric analysis in rats. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether granules of Ricinus communis polyurethane resin implanted immediately after tooth extraction interfere with the time course of alveolar wound healing in rats. Progressive bone neoformation in parallel to a decrease in the volume fraction of connective tissue was quantified by a histometric method 1, 2, 3, and 6 weeks after tooth extraction. In spite of the biocompatible nature, the presence of polyurethane resin granules in the cervical third led to a small (9-22%) but significant delay in bone formation in the middle and apical alveolar thirds from the second week on, as compared to controls.	0
22908641	Enhanced dissipation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the rhizosphere of the Athel tamarisk (Tamarix aphylla L. Karst.) grown in saline-alkaline soils of the former lake Texcoco. Remediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated alkaline saline soil with phreatophyte or \"water loving plants\" was investigated by spiking soil from the former lake Texcoco with 100 mg phenanthrene (Phen) kg(-1) soil, 120 mg anthracene (Ant)kg(-1) soil and 45 mg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) kg(-1) soil and vegetating it with Athel tamarisk (Tamarix aphylla L Karst.). The growth of the Athel tamarisk was not affected by the PAHs. In soil cultivated with Athel tamarisk, the leaching of PAHs to the 32-34 cm layer decreased 2-fold compared to the uncultivated soil. The BaP concentration decreased to 39% of the initial concentration at a distance smaller than 3 cm from the roots and to 45% at a distance larger than 3cm, but 59% remained in unvegetated soil after 240 days. Dissipation of Ant and Phen decreased with depth, but not BaP. The biodegradation of PAHs was affected by their chemical properties and increased in the presence of T. aphylla, but decreased with depth.	0
9781728	Liver as a focus of impaired oxygenation and cytokine production in a porcine model of endotoxicosis. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the liver is a focus of insufficient oxygenation and whether liver is a source of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in a porcine model of endotoxicosis. DESIGN: In vivo, prospective, controlled, repeated-measures, experimental study. SETTING: Experimental physiology laboratory in a university. SUBJECTS: Juvenile pigs, weighing 22 to 35 kg. INTERVENTIONS: Catheters for blood sampling were inserted into the carotid artery, portal vein, hepatic vein, and pulmonary artery of anesthetized animals. Ultrasonic flow probes were placed on the portal vein and the hepatic artery. During surgery, normal saline was infused intravenously at 25 mL/kg/hr. Following stabilization, animals were allocated randomly to one of two groups. The endotoxemic group (n = 6) received 50 mg/kg of purified Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide infused into the external jugular vein over 1 hr. The control group (n = 6) received a sham saline infusion infused over 1 hr. Once the endotoxin or sham infusion was initiated, the rate of the intravenous saline infusion was increased to 48 mL/kg/hr for the remainder of the experiment. Measurements were obtained before the endotoxin or sham infusion, immediately after the infusion, and every 30 mins thereafter for 4 hrs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood gases, lactate, and bioactive TNF and IL-6 concentrations were measured from the carotid artery, portal vein, hepatic vein, and pulmonary artery. The porcine model is characterized by systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, and maintenance of cardiac output. Despite decreased hepatic oxygen delivery in endotoxemic animals (p < .02), there was no change in hepatic oxygen consumption compared with controls. Throughout the experiment, there was net hepatic consumption of lactate in both groups. There was no significant hepatic production (or consumption) of TNF or IL-6 in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In this porcine model of endotoxicosis, there is a reduction of hepatic oxygen delivery but dysoxia is not present. The liver is not a source of TNF or IL-6 in this model of endotoxicosis.	0
21819532	Comparison of real-time elastography with grey-scale ultrasonography for detection of organ-confined prostate cancer and extra capsular extension: a prospective analysis using whole mount sections after radical prostatectomy. OBJECTIVE:    To evaluate whether transrectal real-time elastography (RTE) improves the detection of intraprostatic prostate cancer (PCa) lesions and extracapsular extension (ECE) compared with conventional grey-scale ultrasonography (GSU). PATIENTS AND METHODS:    In total, 229 patients with biopsy-proven PCa were prospectively screened for cancer-suspicious areas and ECE using GSU and RTE.    The largest tumour focus detected by RTE was defined as the index lesion.    The prostate gland was stratified into six sectors on GSU and RTE, which were compared with histopathological whole mount sections after radical prostatectomy. RESULTS:    Histopathologically, PCa was confirmed in 894 out of 1374 (61.8%) evaluated sectors and ECE was identified in 47 (21%) patients.    Of these 894 sectors, RTE correctly detected 594 (66.4%) and GSU 215 (24.0%) cancer suspicious lesions.    Sensitivity was 51% and specificity 72% using RTE compared to 18% and 90% for GSU.    RTE identified the largest side specific tumour focus in 68% of patients.    ECE was identified with a sensitivity of 38% and specificity of 96% using RTE compared to 15% and 97% using GSU. CONCLUSIONS:    Compared with GSU, RTE provides a statistically significant improvement in detection of PCa lesions and ECE.    RTE enhances GSU, although improvement is still needed to achieve a clinically meaningful sensitivity.	0
7940144	Diurnal variation in pulsatile ocular blood flow in normal and glaucomatous eyes. Ocular blood flow, in particular to the optic nerve head, is considered important in determining the extent of glaucomatous damage. The 24-hour variation in the pulsatile component of ocular blood flow (POBF) was measured using a pneumotonometer linked to the Langham Ocular Blood Flow System. Intraocular pressure (IOP), ocular pulse amplitude, POBF, systemic blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at three-hourly intervals over a 24-hour period in 10 ocular hypertensives, eight patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) treated with timolol eyedrops (G timolol 0.25%), and eight ocular normotensive control subjects. The POAG subjects were readmitted for a second set of 24-hour measurements after temporarily discontinuing G timolol for two weeks. The POBF showed no significant diurnal variation in any of the patient groups, the POAG values being taken from the \"off treatment\" period. By contrast, there were overnight falls in IOP, ocular pulse amplitude, blood pressure and heart rate, which reached significance in some groups. This suggests that overall there are compensatory changes in IOP, blood pressure, heart rate, and perhaps ocular vascular resistance, to preserve POBF overnight. Within all groups there was much individual variation, with some subjects showing an overnight fall in POBF, suggesting a lack of autoregulation in these cases who might prove to be at greater risk of developing nocturnal glaucomatous damage. When timolol was withdrawn from POAG subjects, there was no change in POBF despite an increase in IOP, implying that timolol, though effective as ocular hypotensive, did not alter POBF.	0

7488299	Inhibition of leukotriene C4 and B4 release by human eosinophils with the new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor 6-hydroxy-2(4-sulfamoylbenzylamino)-4,5,7-trimethylbenzothiazo le hydrochloride. Eosinophils generate and release leukotrienes C4 and B4 (LTC4, LTB4) and platelet activating factor (PAF), all of which have the capacity to cause inflammation and tissue injury in the airways. This study has examined the effects of a new 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, 6-hydroxy-2-(4-sulfamoylbenzylamino)-4,5,7-trimethylbenzothiazo le hydrochloride (CAS 120164-49-0, E6080) on the release of LTC4, LTB4 and PAF by human eosinophils, Eosinophils stimulated by 1 mumol/l calcium ionophore A23187 for 15 min released 37.5 +/- 2.2 ng, 2.3 +/- 0.3 ng and 4.0 +/- 0.3 pmol per 10(6) cells of immunoreactive LTC4, LTB4 and PAF, respectively (mean +/- SEM, n = 4). LTC4 and LTB4 releases were inhibited dose-dependently by the addition of E6080 to the cell suspension. The IC50 values were 0.26 mumol/l for LTC4 and 0.23 mumol/l for LTB4. PAF release was not inhibited. These results suggest that E6080 is a potent inhibitor of LTC4 and LTB4 release from eosinophils and may provide a protective effect against bronchoconstriction during late-phase asthmatic responses.	0

Here, we introduce a new confocal two-photon microscope system using a mode-locked Yb(3+)-doped fiber laser. The mode-locked fiber laser produces 13 ps pulses with large positive chirping at a repetition rate of 36 MHz with an average power of 80 mW. By using an external grating pair pulse compressor, the pulse width and the frequency chirping of the laser output are controlled for optimum two-photon excitation. For a given objective lens, the optimum condition was obtained by monitoring the two-photon-induced-photocurrent in a GaAsP photodiode at the sample position. The performance of this pulse width optimized two-photon microscope system was demonstrated by imaging Vybrant DiI-stained dorsal root ganglion cells in 2 and 3 dimensions.	0

6984248	[Morpho-functional changes in the frog neurons in ischemia]. After the full spinal cord ishemia in the frog, motoneuron lose their ability to generate spike potentials to a testing stimulation in 30 minutes. The size and structure of these neurons do not differ from those in the control ones. The ten minute high frequency stimulation of motoneurons affected by ishemia results in deep pathologic structural changes. The neuron dimensions decrease, and numerous picnomorphical, dark and vaculized neurons appear. The full ishemia leads to pathologic changes in the neuron structure. However, the number of picnomorphical and dark neurons is considerably less than that after the high frequency activation. Following the 90 minute ishemia, no postsynaptic or spike potentials occur in motoneurons as a response to their stimulation.	0
24044554	Probing the ArcA regulon under aerobic/ROS conditions in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. BACKGROUND: Hydrogen peroxide (H   O   ) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is part of the oxidative burst encountered upon internalization of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) by phagocytic cells. It has previously been established that, the ArcAB two-component system plays a critical role in ROS resistance, but the genes regulated by the system remained undetermined to date. We therefore investigated the ArcA regulon in aerobically growing S. Typhimurium before and after exposure to H   O    by querying gene expression and other physiological changes in wild type and   arcA strains. RESULTS: In the   arcA strain, expression of 292 genes showed direct or indirect regulation by ArcA in response to H   O   , of which 141were also regulated in aerobiosis, but in the opposite direction. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the expression data from WT and   arcA strains, revealed that, in response to H   O    challenge in aerobically grown cells, ArcA down regulated multiple PEP-PTS and ABC transporters, while up regulating genes involved in glutathione and glycerolipid metabolism and nucleotide transport. Further biochemical analysis guided by GSEA results showed that deletion of arcA during aerobic growth lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which was concomitant with an increased NADH/NAD+ ratio. In absence of ArcA under aerobic conditions, H   O    exposure resulted in lower levels of glutathione reductase activity, leading to a decreased GSH (reduced glutathione)/GSSG (oxidized glutathione) ratio. CONCLUSION: The ArcA regulon was defined in 2 conditions, aerobic growth and the combination of peroxide treatment and aerobic growth in S. Typhimurium. ArcA coordinates a response that involves multiple aspects of the carbon flux through central metabolism, which ultimately modulates the reducing potential of the cell.	0
19814555	Penning ionization and ion fragmentation of formamide HCONH2 by He*, Ne*, and Ar* in molecular beams. Mass spectra from Penning ionization by metastable atom bombardment (MAB) in the title system at kinetic energies near 1 kcal/mol are reported. The experiments employ a supersonic excited noble gas beam crossing an effusive beam of formamide vapor. Product ions are extracted perpendicular to the plane of the beams, analyzed by a quadrupole mass filter, and counted by a scintillation-type ion counter. Relative to 70 eV electron impact, the He(*) and Ne(*) spectra show more extensive breakage of C-N and C-H bonds despite the smaller available energy, while the Ar(*) spectrum shows only the molecular ion (m/z 45), H atom elimination (44), and the decarbonylation products CO+NH(3)(+) (17). Fragmentation in the latter system has been analyzed using a combination of ab initio calculations and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory with tunneling correction; good agreement with the experimental 45/44/17 intensity ratio 100/6.8+/-0.7/6.2+/-1.7 is obtained. 15% of m/z 17 and 50% of m/z 44 is attributed to tunneling. The ab initio decarbonylation reaction path yields a hydrogen bonded H(2)N-HCO(+) transition state, which transfers a proton while proceeding downhill to the observed products, while both the path and the energetics support the earlier conclusion that the lowest lying electronically excited state of the ion (2pi or 2a(\")) crosses the ground state early along the reaction path, thereby dominating the dynamics of decarbonylation.	0
21936544	Free radical scavenger properties of a-mangostin: thermodynamics and kinetics of HAT and RAF mechanisms. Mangosteen is a tropical fruit that presents beneficial effects on human health since it is rich in anthocyanins and xanthones, which are considered bioactive compounds that have been described as good free radical scavengers. One of its most active compounds is a-mangostin. In this report, a theoretical study on the free radical scavenger capacity of a-mangostin and its monoanion is analyzed using the density functional theory approximation. Two well-known reaction mechanisms are investigated: the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and the radical adduct formation (RAF). Two other mechanisms are also considered: sequential electron proton Transfer (SEPT) and proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). According to thermodynamics and kinetics, a-mangostin and its deprotonated form are good free radical scavenger through the HAT mechanism, with the anionic (deprotonated) form being more reactive than the neutral one. Their capacity to scavenge OOH free radical is similar to that of carotenes, higher than that of allicin, much higher than that of melatonin and N-acetylcysteine amide, and about 15 times lower than that of 2-propenesulfenic acid.	0
12955446	[Vitreous body floaters and vitrectomy with full visual acuity]. PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of vitrectomy in patients with visually disturbing vitreous body floaters and full visual acuity (VA). METHODS: A total of 9 eyes from 8 patients (2 female, 7 male, median age 57 years) with a preoperative VA of 1.0 were analysed retrospectively. The median duration of symptoms was 12 months. In all eyes a pars plana vitrectomy was performed. The median follow-up period was 13 months. RESULTS: No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. In all patients vision improved subjectively and objective VA remained unchanged. In 2 out of 5 phacic patients a cataract extraction was performed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: In a selected group of patients vitrectomy can improve subjective vision even in eyes with full objective VA. A critical patient selection with respect to psychological criteria and the individual risk of vitrectomy is extremely important.	0

24196706	EHMT1 controls brown adipose cell fate and thermogenesis through the PRDM16 complex. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates chemical energy in the form of heat as a defence against hypothermia and obesity. Current evidence indicates that brown adipocytes arise from Myf5(+) dermotomal precursors through the action of PR domain containing protein 16 (PRDM16) transcriptional complex. However, the enzymatic component of the molecular switch that determines lineage specification of brown adipocytes remains unknown. Here we show that euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) is an essential BAT-enriched lysine methyltransferase in the PRDM16 transcriptional complex and controls brown adipose cell fate. Loss of EHMT1 in brown adipocytes causes a severe loss of brown fat characteristics and induces muscle differentiation in vivo through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and 3) of the muscle-selective gene promoters. Conversely, EHMT1 expression positively regulates the BAT-selective thermogenic program by stabilizing the PRDM16 protein. Notably, adipose-specific deletion of EHMT1 leads to a marked reduction of BAT-mediated adaptive thermogenesis, obesity and systemic insulin resistance. These data indicate that EHMT1 is an essential enzymatic switch that controls brown adipose cell fate and energy homeostasis.	0
12748065	Hyperosmotic stress activates Rho: differential involvement in Rho kinase-dependent MLC phosphorylation and NKCC activation. Hyperosmotic stress initiates adaptive responses, including phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) and concomitant activation of Na+-K+-Cl- cotransporter (NKCC). Because the small GTPase Rho is a key regulator of MLC phosphorylation, we investigated 1) whether Rho is activated by hyperosmotic stress, and if so, what the triggering factors are, and 2) whether the Rho/Rho kinase (ROK) pathway is involved in MLC phosphorylation and NKCC activation. Rho activity was measured in tubular epithelial cells by affinity pulldown assay. Hyperosmolarity induced rapid (<1 min) and sustained (>20 min) Rho activation that was proportional to the osmotic concentration and reversed within minutes upon restoration of isotonicity. Both decreased cell volume at constant ionic strength and elevated total ionic strength at constant cell volume were capable of activating Rho. Changes in [Na+] and [K+] at normal total salinity failed to activate Rho, and Cl- depletion did not affect the hyperosmotic response. Thus alterations in cellular volume and ionic strength but not individual ion concentrations seem to be the critical triggering factors. Hyperosmolarity induced mono- and diphosphorylation of MLC, which was abrogated by the Rho-family blocker Clostridium toxin B. ROK inhibitor Y-27632 suppressed MLC phosphorylation under isotonic conditions and prevented its rise over isotonic levels in hypertonically stimulated cells. ML-7 had a smaller inhibitory effect. In contrast, it abolished the hypertonic activation of NKCC, whereas Y-27632 failed to inhibit this response. Thus hyperosmolarity activates Rho, and Rho/ROK pathway contributes to basal and hyperosmotic MLC phosphorylation. However, the hypertonic activation of NKCC is ROK independent, implying that the ROK-dependent component of MLC phosphorylation can be uncoupled from NKCC activation.	0
23358686	Inhibition of protein kinase CK2 reduces Cyp24a1 expression and enhances 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) antitumor activity in human prostate cancer cells. Vitamin D has broad range of physiological functions and antitumor effects. 24-Hydroxylase, encoded by the CYP24A1 gene, is the key enzyme for degrading many forms of vitamin D including the most active form, 1,25D(3). Inhibition of CYP24A1 enhances 1,25D(3) antitumor activity. To isolate regulators of CYP24A1 expression in prostate cancer cells, we established a stable prostate cancer cell line PC3 with CYP24A1 promoter driving luciferase expression to screen a small molecular library for compounds that inhibit CYP24A1 promoter activity. From this screening, we identified, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole (TBBz), a protein kinase CK2 selective inhibitor as a disruptor of CYP24A1 promoter activity. We show that TBBz inhibits CYP24A1 promoter activity induced by 1,25D(3) in prostate cancer cells. In addition, TBBz downregulates endogenous CYP24A1 mRNA level in TBBz-treated PC3 cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated CK2 knockdown reduces 1,25D(3)-induced CYP24A1 mRNA expression in PC3 cells. These results suggest that CK2 contributes to 1,25D(3)-mediated target gene expression. Finally, inhibition of CK2 by TBBz or CK2 siRNA significantly enhances 1,25D(3)-mediated antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo in a xenograft model. In summary, our findings reveal that protein kinase CK2 is involved in the regulation of CYP24A1 expression by 1,25D(3) and CK2 inhibitor enhances 1,25D(3)-mediated antitumor effect.	0

9158213	Hypertension in the hemodialysis population: any relation to one-year survival? Few studies have quantified the effect of hypertension on survival in the hemodialysis population. We report the effect of hypertension on 1-year survival in 649 hemodialysis patients (89% black). In univariate analysis, hypertension was associated with improved 1-year survival (relative risk [RR], 0.48; P = 0.002 compared with normotensive patients). This effect of hypertension was mostly caused by the associated antihypertensive treatment because untreated hypertensive patients had survival rates equal to normotensive patients (RR, 0.87; P = 0.70). On the other hand, treated hypertensive patients fared better than normotensive patients (RR, 0.41; P = 0.0006). This was also true in multivariate analysis, in which antihypertensive treatment was associated with reduced RR (RR, 0.55; P = 0.02) whereas the level of blood pressure per se was insignificant (RR, 0.99; P = 0.63 per 1 mm Hg increase in predialysis mean arterial pressure). Other factors of significance in multivariate analysis included age (RR, 1.03/y; P = 0.0004), serum albumin (RR, 0.38/g; P = 0.002), and diabetes mellitus (RR, 1.58; P = 0.06). Our study suggests that antihypertensive treatment has a favorable effect on survival in the hemodialysis population irrespective of the level of blood pressure control.	0
19364826	All-trans-retinoic acid represses obesity and insulin resistance by activating both peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor beta/delta and retinoic acid receptor. Many biological activities of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) are mediated by the ligand-activated transcription factors termed retinoic acid receptors (RARs), but this hormone can also activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta). We show here that adipocyte differentiation is accompanied by a shift in RA signaling which, in mature adipocytes, allows RA to activate both RARs and PPARbeta/delta, thereby enhancing lipolysis and depleting lipid stores. In vivo studies using a dietary-induced mouse model of obesity indicated that onset of obesity is accompanied by downregulation of adipose PPARbeta/delta expression and activity. RA treatment of obese mice induced expression of PPARbeta/delta and RAR target genes involved in regulation of lipid homeostasis, leading to weight loss and improved insulin responsiveness. RA treatment also restored adipose PPARbeta/delta expression. The data indicate that suppression of obesity and insulin resistance by RA is largely mediated by PPARbeta/delta and is further enhanced by activation of RARs. By targeting two nuclear receptors, RA may be a uniquely efficacious agent in the therapy and prevention of the metabolic syndrome.	0
6865437	Serum sialic acid is a biologic marker for malignant disease. Serial serum sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) was measured in 16 patients with advanced cancer of various histologic types. In the 15 evaluable patients serial changes in sialic acid correlated with the clinical course. Isolated sialic acid values were not predictive of clinical response. Serial determination of serum sialic acid appears to be a useful monitor of tumor burden.	0
9306481	Vaccine antigen interactions after a combination diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis/purified capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid vaccine in two-, four- and six-month-old infants. OBJECTIVE: The safety and immunogenicity of a diphtheria-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP; Trepedia)/Haemophilus influenzae b polysaccharide (PRP-T; ActHib) combined vaccine (TriHibir; Pasteur M  rieux Connaught) was compared with DTaP and PRP-T given at the same visit but at separate sites in a prospective multicenter, open label trial. METHODS: Infants were randomized to four groups (three consistency lots of DTaP/PRP-T vs. one of the consistency lots given as separate vaccines); injections were administered at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Pre-Dose 1 and post-Dose 3 sera were assayed for antibody titers against all antigens. Reactions to the vaccinations were assessed by parent questionnaire for 30 days after each injection visit. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-five infants were enrolled; 296 evaluable infants were included in the DTaP/PRP-T group compared with 70 infants in the DTaP and PRP-T vaccine group. Infants who received the combined vaccine had higher post-Dose 3 geometric mean antibody titers to diphtheria antitoxin (P < 0.01) and pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (P < 0.05) and lower geometric mean antibody titers to tetanus antitoxin (P < 0.05) and Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) polysaccharide (PRP) (P < 0.05). The geometric mean anti-PRP antibody titer in the DTaP/PRP-T group was 4.3 micrograms/ml compared with 7.0 micrograms/ml in the separate vaccine group (P < 0.05), and the percentage of infants with antibody titers > or = 0.15 and 1 microgram/ml were, respectively, 95 and 86%, whereas they were 100% for both titers in the separate vaccines group. DTaP/ PRP-T vaccine given concomitantly or 1 month apart from hepatitis B vaccine and oral poliomyelitis vaccine caused no significant differences in immunogenicity or safety. The safety assessments for the DTaP/PRP-T vaccine showed no consistent differences in systemic or local injection site reactions compared with DTaP and PRP-T administered separately. CONCLUSION: Although the antibody responses to tetanus and Hib polysaccharide in the evaluated DTaP/PRP-T combined vaccine were significantly lower than those seen after separate DTaP and PRP-T administration, the combined vaccine elicited an immune response against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae b likely to confer protection.	0
21139064	A C subunit of the plant nuclear factor NF-Y required for rhizobial infection and nodule development affects partner selection in the common bean-Rhizobium etli symbiosis. Legume plants are able to interact symbiotically with soil bacteria to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules. Although specific recognition between rhizobia and legume species has been extensively characterized, plant molecular determinants that govern the preferential colonization by different strains within a single rhizobium species have received little attention. We found that the C subunit of the heterotrimeric nuclear factor NF-Y from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) NF-YC1 plays a key role in the improved nodulation seen by more efficient strains of rhizobia. Reduction of NF-YC1 transcript levels by RNA interference (RNAi) in Agrobacterium rhizogenes-induced hairy roots leads to the arrest of nodule development and defects in the infection process with either high or low efficiency strains. Induction of three G2/M transition cell cycle genes in response to rhizobia was impaired or attenuated in NF-YC1 RNAi roots, suggesting that this transcription factor might promote nodule development by activating cortical cell divisions. Furthermore, overexpression of this gene has a positive impact on nodulation efficiency and selection of Rhizobium etli strains that are naturally less efficient and bad competitors. Our findings suggest that this transcription factor might be part of a mechanism that links nodule organogenesis with an early molecular dialogue that selectively discriminates between high- and low-quality symbiotic partners, which holds important implications for optimizing legume performance.	0
17374887	Multiplex PCR assay for identification of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis from pure cultures and for rapid detection of this pathogen in clinical samples. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the aetiological agent of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA), a debilitating disease of sheep and goats. Accurate diagnosis of CLA primarily relies on microbiological examination, followed by biochemical identification of isolates. In an effort to facilitate C. pseudotuberculosis detection, a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay was developed targeting three genes of this bacterium: the 16S rRNA gene, rpoB and pld. This method allowed efficient identification of 40 isolates of this bacterium that had been identified previously by biochemical testing. Analysis of taxonomically related species did not generate the C. pseudotuberculosis mPCR amplification profile, thereby demonstrating the assay's specificity. As little as 1 pg of C. pseudotuberculosis genomic DNA was detected by this mPCR assay, demonstrating the sensitivity of the method. The detection limit in clinical samples was estimated to be 10(3) c.f.u. C. pseudotuberculosis could be detected directly in pus samples from infected sheep and goats (n=56) with a high diagnostic sensitivity (94.6 %). The developed assay significantly improves rapid C. pseudotuberculosis detection and could supersede bacteriological culture for microbiological and epidemiological diagnosis of CLA.	0

11077858	[Brain injuries]. The author presents an account of contemporary knowledge on the classification of brain injuries and different types of these injuries which comprise a wide range from minor injuries of the head with impairment of memory to severe lethal injuries. The author emphasizes the differentiation of two basic types of injuries--primary and secondary, because this differentiation is important for the prognosis of the casualty as well as for the therapeutic strategy. He emphasize also the fact that the target group in brain injuries are patients with secondary damage which is caused as a rule by a sequelae of intracranial hypertension.	0
9455896	Axon order in the visual pathway of the quokka wallaby. Axon order throughout the visual pathway of the quokka wallaby (Setonix brachyurus) was determined after localised retinal applications of the tracers DiI and/or DiASP. Postnatal days (P) 22-90 were studied to encompass the development and refinement of retinal projections. Order was essentially similar at all stages. Axons entered the optic nerve head true to their sector of retinal origin. In the optic nerve, nasal and temporal axons continued to reflect their retinal origin, dominating, respectively, the medial and lateral halves. By contrast, dorsal and ventral axons exchanged locations between the retrobulbar level and one-third the distance along the nerve; thus, the inversion of the dorsoventral retinal axis, imposed by the lens, was corrected. Decussating axons maintained their relative locations through the chiasm. At the base of the optic tract, nasal and temporal axons underwent an axial rotation to lie on the medial and lateral sides, respectively; thus nasal overlapped with ventral axons and temporal with dorsal axons. Axons maintained their alignments throughout the tract, and as a result, nasal and ventral axons invaded the superior colliculus medially, whereas temporal and dorsal axons invaded laterally. Each retinal quadrant terminated preferentially in its retinotopically appropriate sector of the colliculus. The arrangement of axons in the quokka visual pathway displays several novel features. Axon order is distinct throughout, involving a well-demarcated exchange of dorsal and ventral axons in the nerve and an axial rotation of nasal and temporal axons at the base of the tract; these relocations suggest decision regions for growing axons. The organisation presumably underlies the less extensive searching within the developing superior colliculus to generate retinotopic maps in the quokka and also in tammar wallaby [Marotte, J. Comp Neurol. 293:524-539, 1990] than in the rat [Simon and O'Leary, J. Neurosci. 12:1212-1232, 1992].	0
16816832	Reductions in plasma prolactin during acute erythropoietin administration. OBJECTIVES: The presence of erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptors in several central nervous system regions indicates additional functions beside its hematopoietic role. Preclinical data suggest that it may slow down the process of neuronal loss, and that EPO may cause dopamine release, and thus influence hormone release, especially prolactin. This possibility has not yet been studied in humans. METHODS: During a clinical trial on possible protective effects in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we studied the acute effects of EPO administration on prolactin, the release of which is under tonic inhibition of hypothalamic-pituitary dopaminergic activity. Prolactin as well as EPO levels were estimated in blood samples taken every 30 min over 2 hours after administration of 3000 IU EPO i.v. in seven male and four female patients with ALS. RESULTS: The baseline PRL levels of the 11 patients were all within normal range (4.5-10.5 ng/ml). EPO administration caused a significant reduction in prolactin levels, maximal at 60 min after administration. Reductions in PRL were not related to EPO dose (IU per kg body weight), or to duration of illness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that EPO promotes dopamine release in humans, and is consistent with preclinical data showing that EPO releases dopamine from rat striatal slices. Previous reports showed that dopaminergic neurons express EPO receptors, which exert a facilitating action on dopamine release, and the present data indicate that this may hold true in humans.	0
7943744	Spectrofluorimetry at zero angle: determination of salicylic acid in an acetylsalicylic acid pharmaceutical formulation. In this work, a solid-state spectrofluorimetric method for drug assays was developed. In particular, we report the determination of salicylic acid (SA), as a hydrolysis product, in solid pharmaceutical formulations containing acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Recently, we described a sensitive and accurate fluorescence method that provided, through a mathematical application, the simultaneous determination of ASA and SA. By means of the spectrofluorimetric method reported herein it was possible to carry out the SA determination, without any mathematical calculation and with a sensitivity 100 times that of our previous method. The intra- and inter-day reproducibility of the spectrofluorimetric method, expressed as the relative standard deviation, ranged from 0.1 to 0.3%. The present method requires a fluorescence apparatus with the excitation and detection systems in-line (zero angle). The detection system was not sensitive to the excitation wavelength, but was highly sensitive to emission wavelengths from 350 to 800 nm. The results obtained were compared with those of our previous spectrofluorimetric method, together with those of a high-performance liquid chromatography method and a US Pharmacopeia method. The sensitivity of the method was of the order of 10(-8) g.	0
11932910	Prediction of intracranial metastases in cancer patients with headache. BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to investigate the diagnostic value of neurologic evaluation for the prediction of intracranial metastases in cancer patients with new or changed headache. METHODS: Between February 1997 and February 2000, general practitioners and specialists referred cancer patients with new or changed headache to the Department of Neurology at the study institution. All patients underwent a structured history and neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was used as the gold standard for determining the presence of intracranial metastases. The association between baseline patient characteristics, history variables, and variables from the neurologic examination in patients with intracranial metastases was evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses in combination with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. RESULTS: Sixty-eight consecutive patients were included in the current study (48 females and 20 males). The mean age of the patients was 57 years (range, 24-88 years; standard deviation +/- 13.3 years). Breast carcinoma was the primary tumor in 32 patients (47.1%) and lung carcinoma was the primary tumor in 12 patients (17.6%). Intracranial metastases occurred in 22 patients (32.4%). The occurrence of intracranial metastases was predicted in the multivariate logistic regression analyses by one baseline patient characteristic variable and 2 history variables (i.e., headache duration of < or =10 weeks [odds ratio (OR) of 11.0; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1-108.2], emesis [OR of 4.0; 95% CI, 1.1-14.3], and pain not of tension- type [OR of 6.7; 95% CI, 1.8-25.1]). No variable from the neurologic examination was found to add information to the prediction model. When at least one of the three predictors was present, all patients with intracranial metastases could be identified with this prediction model. MRI could be omitted in 12 patients (26%) without intracranial metastases. The ROC area under curve of this model was 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial metastases were found in 32.4% of the cancer patients with headache as the presenting symptom. Although 3 significant clinical predictors were found (headache duration < or =10 weeks, emesis, and pain not of tension- type), few patients could be excluded from undergoing MRI because of a low specificity. Therefore, MRI of the brain was considered to be warranted in all patients in the current study.	0

17346085	Synthesis of upper-rim allyl- and p-methoxyphenylazocalix[4]arenes and their efficiencies in chromogenic sensing of Hg2+ ion. A series of upper-rim p-allyl and p-methoxyphenylazocalix[4]arenes (6, 8, 9a,b, and 10a,b) were synthesized and shown to exhibit substantial color changes upon complexation with Hg2+ ion. Both the upper-rim p-allyl- and p-methoxyphenylazo groups on calix[4]arenes are proven to be key components in the recognition of Hg2+ ion. Job's plots revealed 1:1 binding stoichiometry for all these p-allyl- and p-arylazo-coupled calix[4]arenes with Hg2+ ions and Benesi-Hilderbrand plots were used for determination of their association constants. Our results also demonstrated that two p-methoxyphenylazo groups prefer to bind Hg2+ in a distal orientation rather than a proximal one, and if there are three p-methoxyphenylazo groups, the third flanking p-methoxyphenylazo group plays a role in disturbing the binding of the two distal diazo groups. Furthermore, it should be noted that triazocalix[4]arenes (6, 9a, and 9b) responded to all 14 metal ions without showing much preference among the eight transition-metal ions screened in this work (Cr3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Ag+, Cd2+, Hg+, Hg2+, and Pb2+).	0
17079658	Experience-dependent eye movements, awareness, and hippocampus-dependent memory. We asked what kind of memory is operating when eye movements change as the result of experience. Participants viewed scenes that were either novel, repeated, or manipulated (i.e., a change was introduced in one region of the scene). Eye movements differed depending on the past viewing history of each scene. Participants made fewer fixations and sampled fewer regions when scenes were repeated than when scenes were novel. When scenes were altered, participants made more fixations in the altered region, spent more time looking at the altered region, and made more transitions into and out of the altered region than in unchanged (matched) regions in the repeated scenes. Importantly, these effects occurred only when individuals were aware that a change had occurred. Participants who were unaware that the scene had been altered looked at the changed scenes in the same way that they looked at repeated scenes. Thus, there was no indication that eye movements could reveal an unaware (unconscious) form of memory. Instead, eye movements reflected conscious memory of whether the scene was repeated or manipulated. The findings were the same when awareness was assessed after viewing all the scenes (experiment 1) and when awareness was assessed after each scene was presented (experiment 2). In experiment 3, memory-impaired patients with damage limited to the hippocampus were impaired at deciding whether scenes were novel, repeated, or manipulated. Thus, the ability to consciously recollect recent encounters with scenes reflects a form of hippocampus-dependent memory. The findings show that experience-dependent eye movements in response to altered scenes reflect conscious, declarative memory, and they support the link between aware memory, declarative memory, and hippocampus-dependent memory.	0

8959046	One-way cross-sensitization and cross-tolerance to seizure activity from cocaine to lidocaine. The present study examined the effects of daily treatment with a subconvulsant dose (50 mg/kg) of cocaine or lidocaine on susceptibility to seizures induced by cross-injections of the same dose of the other local anesthetic, and to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) or N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMDLA) in ddY mice. Repeated administration of 50 mg/kg cocaine caused the development of sensitization to cocaine-induced seizures during an initial 3 or 4 days, followed by the development of tolerance on days 4-6. The same dose of lidocaine, however, produced little or no seizure activity following repeated administration. In contrast, when injected 24 hr after 2-4 days of cocaine treatment, 50 mg/kg lidocaine produced severe seizures. Interestingly, this cross-sensitization from cocaine to lidocaine diminished upon further cocaine treatment. In contrast, treatment with lidocaine for 2-6 days had no effect on subsequent changes in seizure susceptibility following repeated cocaine injections. Neither treatment with cocaine nor lidocaine for 2 or 5 days influenced susceptibility to seizures induced by a challenge injection of PTZ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or NMDLA (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 hr after treatment. HPLC analyses revealed that the cocaine treatment paradigm used in these studies increased the levels of the polyamines, putrescine and spermidine, in mouse brain, while lidocaine treatment had no effect on cerebral polyamine levels. These results suggest that there are differences in the neural mechanisms underlying the convulsant properties of cocaine and lidocaine in ddY mice.	0

12210171	Optimization of background electrolytes for capillary electrophoresis: II. Computer simulation and comparison with experiments. A mathematical and computational model described in the previous paper (Gas, B., Coufal, P., Jaros, M., Muzik  r, J., Jel  nek, L., J. Chromatogr. A 2001, 905, 269-279) is adapted, algorithmized, and a computer program PeakMaster having a status of freeware (http://natur.cuni.cz/ approximately gas) is introduced. The model enables optimization of background electrolyte (BGE) systems for capillary zone electrophoresis. The model allows putting to use uni- or di- or trivalent electrolytes and allows also for modeling highly acidic or alkaline BGEs. It takes into account the dependence of ionic mobilities and dissociation of weak electrolytes on the ionic strength. The model calculates the effective mobility of analytes and predicts parameters of the system that are experimentally available, such as the transfer ratio, which is a measure of the sensitivity in the indirect UV detection or the molar conductivity detection response, which expresses the sensitivity of the conductivity detection. Further, the model enables evaluation of a tendency of the analyte to undergo electromigration dispersion or peak broadening. The suitability of the model is verified by comparison of the predicted results with experiments, even under conditions that are far from ideal (under extreme pH and a high ionic strength).	0
18854635	Neurosyphilis with mesiotemporal magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. We describe a patient with mesial temporal T2-weighted image hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging that mimicked paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. The patient showed pupillary abnormalities suggestive of a diagnosis of neurosyphilis, and the diagnosis was supported by the results of a serum Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Making a diagnosis of neurosyphilis is occasionally difficult because of the variety of clinical and imaging findings. Appropriate diagnosis and commencing adequate treatment are needed for a good prognosis; thus, neurosyphilis should be included in the differential diagnosis of mesiotemporal magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities.	0
17606390	Paraspinal abscess complicated by endocarditis following a facet joint injection. Infectious complications secondary to lumbar facet injections are exceedingly rare, follow an indolent course, and local sequelae include abscess spread or infections of the central nervous system. We present the case of the development of a facet abscess and infective endocarditis, which developed shortly after a lumbar facet injection. With the increase in interventional pain procedures, physicians must be aware of potential infectious complications.	0
11986949	Human plasma contains a soluble form of CD86 which is present at elevated levels in some leukaemia patients. Cell surface expression of CD86 (mCD86) provides an important co-stimulatory signal which profoundly influences immune responses. In this report, we investigated the potential presence of a circulating soluble form of CD86 (sCD86) in normal individuals and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Circulating sCD86 was detected in the plasma of all normal individuals (1.04 +/- 0.33 ng/ml, n = 51) and patients analysed. Plasma collected from AML patients in remission (n = 6) contained only low levels of sCD86 but significantly elevated levels (> or =2.65 ng/ml, P < 0.0001) were detected in 10/24 AML patients analysed at the time of presentation or relapse. Significantly elevated levels of sCD86 were also detected in 2/17 B-CLL patients. There was no correlation between sCD86 levels and other clinical parameters. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that normal monocytes and dendritic cells, as well as isolated AML (n = 2) and B-CLL (n = 4) cells, expressed an alternatively spliced transcript of CD86 which encoded a soluble form absent in normal T, B and NK cells. The finding that a proportion of leukaemia patients contain elevated levels of sCD86 and that at least some leukaemic cells express sCD86 transcript suggests a potential role for sCD86 in modulating mCD86 signalling during the malignant process.	0
21574570	Accommodating a nonconservative internal mutation by water-mediated hydrogen bonding between b-sheet strands: a comparison of human and rat type B (mitochondrial) cytochrome b5. Mammalian type B (mitochondrial) b(5) cytochromes exhibit greater amino acid sequence diversity than their type A (microsomal) counterparts, as exemplified by the type B proteins from human (hCYB5B) and rat (rCYB5B). The comparison of X-ray crystal structures of hCYB5B and rCYB5B reported herein reveals a striking difference in packing involving the five-strand b-sheet, which can be attributed to fully buried residue 21 in strand b4. The greater bulk of Leu21 in hCYB5B in comparison to that of Thr21 in rCYB5B results in a substantial displacement of the first two residues in b5, and consequent loss of two of the three hydrogen bonds between b5 and b4. Hydrogen bonding between the residues is instead mediated by two well-ordered, fully buried water molecules. In a 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation, one of the buried water molecules in the hCYB5B structure exchanged readily with solvent via intermediates having three water molecules sandwiched between b4 and b5. When the buried water molecules were removed prior to a second 10 ns simulation, b4 and b5 formed persistent hydrogen bonds identical to those in rCYB5B, but the Leu21 side chain was forced to adopt a rarely observed conformation. Despite the apparently greater ease of access of water to the interior of hCYB5B than of rCYB5B suggested by these observations, the two proteins exhibit virtually identical stability, dynamic, and redox properties. The results provide new insight into the factors stabilizing the cytochrome b(5) fold.	0
24332583	Endothelial progenitors. The studies carried out during the last two decades have represented a great effort in trying to identify and define cell populations endowed with the phenotypic and functional properties of endothelial progenitors. From these studies a scenario now emerges indicating that in the blood there are very rare endothelial progenitor cells, called endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) or late outgrowth endothelial cells, not originated from bone marrow, capable of generating phenotypically and functionally competent endothelial cells, capable to be incorporated in vivo into growing vessels. ECFCs are present in the circulation as well as cells resident in the vascular endothelial intima. In addition to these progenitors, there are some hematopoietic progenitor cells capable of generating a monocytic cell progeny exerting a pro-angiogenic activity in vivo, but unable to be directly incorporated into growing vessels. These cells exert a pro-angiogenic effect in vivo through a paracrine mechanism based on the secretion of growth factors and cytokines.	0
15805131	Improving patient-provider communication: insights from interpreters. BACKGROUND: It is important for physicians to recognize and address potential cross-cultural communication barriers with their patients. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of trained medical interpreters for ensuring effective patient-provider communication. Medical interpreters also represent an untapped source of insight into common communication problems. Such insights can contribute to strengthening physicians' cross cultural communication skills. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore professional medical interpreters' experiences and perspectives regarding patient-provider communication difficulties. METHODS: Key informant interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of nine professional interpreters working at the Geneva University Hospitals general medicine outpatient clinic. RESULTS: Interpreters described three domains where physicians and patients were likely to differ, and where mutual lack of awareness of those differences could lead to misunderstandings. These were: (1) ideas about the patient's health problem; (2) expectations of the clinical encounter; and (3) verbal and non-verbal communication styles. Interpreters recommended that cultural competence training for physicians focus on raising awareness about potential sources of misunderstanding and about the difficulties inherent in medical translation; providing basic background knowledge of patients' countries of origin; and adapting to patients' communication styles. While physicians' own perceptions of communication difficulties are important for developing learner-centered training activities, interpreters' bilingual and bicultural position allows for the identification of communication barriers that may be difficult for physicians to recognize.	0
20077932	[Comparison of TTR and CMV promoters in vivo and in vitro via a secreted luciferase reporter system]. GLuc (Gaussia luciferase) is a secreted luciferase with high sensitivity. In this study, we primarily compared expression character of PTTR with that of PCMV, relied on easy secretion, high sensitivity and simple and fast detection of GLuc. We firstly constructed two plasmids pAAV2-neo-TTR-GLuc and pAAV2-neo-CMV-GLuc. Then, 4 cell lines were transfected with the two plasmids in aid of Lipofectamine 2000, including Huh7 and HepG2, which are derived from liver cells, as well as HEK293 and HeLaS3 cells, which are non-liver cell lines. We monitored the expression of GLuc in the supernatant of these cell cultures at different time points post-transfection. Furthermore, we injected the two plasmids with different doses into BALB/c mice by the means of hydrodynamic delivery and monitored the GLuc expression in vivo with 2.5 microl tail tip blood since 2 h post-injection. The cell assay results suggested that the expression of GLuc driven by CMV promoter was significantly higher than that of GLuc driven by TTR promoter. And, the luciferase activity of GLuc driven by CMV promoter was 50-300 times higher than that of GLuc driven by TTR promoter in HEK293 and HeLaS3 cell lines, but less than 10 times higher than that of GLuc driven by TTR promoter in the HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines, indicating the relative liver-specificity of TTR promoter. In the animal assay, the higher luciferase activity was determined in CMV promoter group than in TTR promoter group at different doses of the two plasmids. But the expression patterns for the two promoters differed obviously. The expression of GLuc driven by CMV promoter reached the maximum 10 hours post-injection and declined rapidly; while the expression of GLuc driven by TTR promoter reached the maximum 48 hours after delivery, and declined very slowly. These results implied that PTTR could keep expression of driven gene in a long time although its expression intensity is lower than PCMV's. Thus, it is more suitable for maintaining longer expression of target genes in liver.	0

The dynamic of granulocytic macrophages and erythroid precursors content in bone marrow of CBA mice, irradiated by 2.0 Gy and the level of colony-stimulating and erythropoietic activities in supernatant of bone marrow myelocariocytes and blood serum were studied. The process of haemopoiesis regeneration was accompanied by increasing of the values of these indexes in bone marrow and peripheral blood. The treatment of bone marrow cells by monoclonal antibodies to Thy 1.2 antigens resulted in decreasing of myeloid precursors and diminishing of colony-stimulating activity of bone marrow cells supernatant.	0
23396490	[The extension of national health insurance in Senegal: progress and obstacles]. This article analyzes the progress and the difficulties in the expansion of the Senegalese national health insurance scheme. The methodology is based, on one hand, on institutional data and documents, and on the other hand, on interviews with various actors in the health system. We present the health insurance extension scheme and place it in the context of the experience of other poor countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Mutual health insurance has a particularly important place in this extension. We then assess the state of progress of the extension of this mutual health insurance to show the uncertainties in the achievement of the reforms. Finally, we discuss the structural limitations and the conditions of the program's success. We underline in particular the necessity of a more systemic approach.	0

14716022	A double-pulsar system: a rare laboratory for relativistic gravity and plasma physics. The clocklike properties of pulsars moving in the gravitational fields of their unseen neutron-star companions have allowed unique tests of general relativity and provided evidence for gravitational radiation. We report here the detection of the 2.8-second pulsar J0737-3039B as the companion to the 23-millisecond pulsar J0737-3039A in a highly relativistic double neutron star system, allowing unprecedented tests of fundamental gravitational physics. We observed a short eclipse of J0737-3039A by J0737-3039B and orbital modulation of the flux density and the pulse shape of J0737-3039B, probably because of the influence of J0737-3039A's energy flux on its magnetosphere. These effects will allow us to probe magneto-ionic properties of a pulsar magnetosphere.	0
16300180	Diagnosis of suspected hypovitaminosis A using magnetic resonance imaging in African lions (Panthera leo). Vitamin A deficiency is described in captive lions. Ante mortem diagnosis can either be made by serum analysis or liver biopsy, both of which may be problematic. This study utilised magnetic resonance imaging to identify vitamin A deficiency in lions with relatively mild clinical signs, which could otherwise be attributed to numerous other neurological conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive, reliable diagnostic tool to demonstrate pathology typically associated with this condition. To accommodate varying lion ages and sizes, a number of cranium and brain measurements were compared with that of the maximum diameter of the occular vitreous humor. Occular ratios of the tentorium cerebelli osseum and occipital bone were most reliable in diagnosing the thickened osseous structures characteristic of hypovitaminosis A. The ratio of maximum:minimum dorsoventral diameter of the C1 spinal cord was also of value.	0
11038152	Metabolites of caspofungin acetate, a potent antifungal agent, in human plasma and urine. Caspofungin acetate (MK-0991) is a semisynthetic pneumocandin derivative being developed as a parenteral antifungal agent with broad-spectrum activity against systemic infections such as those caused by Candida and Aspergillus species. Following a 1-h i.v. infusion of 70 mg of [(3)H]MK-0991 to healthy subjects, excretion of drug-related material was very slow, such that 41 and 35% of the dosed radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively, over 27 days. Plasma and urine samples collected around 24 h postdose contained predominantly unchanged MK-0991, together with trace amounts of a peptide hydrolysis product, M0, a linear peptide. However, at later sampling times, M0 proved to be the major circulating component, whereas corresponding urine specimens contained mainly the hydrolytic metabolites M1 and M2, together with M0 and unchanged MK-0991, whose cumulative urinary excretion over the first 16 days postdose represented 13, 71, 1, and 9%, respectively, of the urinary radioactivity. The major metabolite, M2, was highly polar and extremely unstable under acidic conditions when it was converted to a less polar product identified as N-acetyl-4(S)-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-L-threonine gamma-lactone. Derivatization of M2 in aqueous media led to its identification as the corresponding gamma-hydroxy acid, N-acetyl-4(S)-hydroxy-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-L-threonine. Metabolite M1, which was extremely polar, eluting from HPLC column just after the void volume, was identified by chemical derivatization as des-acetyl-M2. Thus, the major urinary and plasma metabolites of MK-0991 resulted from peptide hydrolysis and/or N-acetylation.	0
24035554	Duration of efficacy increases with the repetition of botulinum toxin A injections in primary axillary hyperhidrosis: a study in 83 patients. BACKGROUND: Intradermal injections of botulinum toxin are effective but transitory in primary axillary hyperhidrosis. These injections are repeated when the symptoms recur. The reported duration of efficacy is variable, from 2 to 24 months, but it is unknown how the duration of efficacy changes when injections are repeated. OBJECTIVE: In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate changes in the duration of efficacy of botulinum toxin injections (Dysport, Ipsen, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) with the repetition of injections in patients with axillary hyperhidrosis. METHODS: From May 2001 to April 2012 inclusive, 83 patients were treated with a dose of 125 U per underarm. We compared the duration of effect of the first and last toxin injections. RESULTS: The median duration of efficacy for the first injection was 5.5 months, whereas that for the last injection was 8.5 months. The difference between these 2 durations is statistically significant (P  = .0002). LIMITATIONS: Although retrospective and based on the declarative, this work is the first to our knowledge to highlight this benefit of treatment and to evaluate botulinum toxin over such a long period (11 years). CONCLUSION: There appears to be an increase in the duration of efficacy of botulinum toxin A injections with the repetition of injections in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The reasons for this effect may be linked to the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, and may improve our understanding of its pharmacologic effects.	0

18582808	Quilty effect areas are frequently associated with endocardial C4d deposition. BACKGROUND: The meaning and clinical implications of the Quilty effect (QE) are not entirely clear. In some biopsies we have found complement split C4d deposition in QE areas, but we do fully comprehend the frequency or pathogenic relationships involved. The objective of this study was to gain insight into the immunologic events involved in the QE, and to understand if and how it relates to complement activation. METHODS: Protocol allograft biopsies (January to December 2005) with evidence of the QE, without cellular rejection or changes suspicious for antibody-mediated rejection, were selected for C4d, CD3, CD20 and CD68 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among 128 allograft biopsies (42 patients), 17 (11 patients) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eleven of the 17 biopsies (64.7%), from 8 patients, showed C4d deposition in the endocardium; the positivity was interestingly linear in the endocardium and surrounded by the lymphocytes forming the Quilty lesion. In some cases, the linear C4d deposition extended to the endocardium surrounding the QE area. This pattern was not detected in any of 66 heart allograft biopsies without the QE. B cells were second to T cells in their contribution to the QE, comprising a median of 40% (range, 20% to 50%) of the cells. C4d deposition was not associated with clinical alterations. CONCLUSIONS: The QE is frequently associated with C4d deposition in the endocardium of patients without evidence of rejection. This event suggests a pathogenic relationship between the QE and complement activation. It is possible that the simultaneous presence of both features in an allograft heart biopsy, without evidence of rejection, indicates better adaptation of allograft to host (\"accommodation\"); however, the precise meaning and implications are not yet known.	0
19077858	Positive and negative psychological impact after secondary exposure to politically motivated violence among body handlers and rehabilitation workers. The positive and negative psychological impact of secondary exposure to politically motivated violence was examined among body handlers and hospital rehabilitation workers, 2 groups that differed in their proximity and immediacy to violent events. Survivors of politically motivated violence served as a comparison group. Body handlers experienced high levels of positive psychological impact and traumatic stress symptoms. Levels of positive psychological impact among on-scene body handlers were higher than those experienced by rehabilitation workers. Traumatic stress symptoms predicted positive psychological impact among body handlers. These findings indicate that proximity to stressors is associated with higher levels of positive and negative psychological impact. Physical proximity is a major contributory factor to both positive and negative psychological effects of secondary exposure to trauma.	0

18206534	The UOK 257 cell line: a novel model for studies of the human Birt-Hogg-Dub   gene pathway. The establishment, characterization, and tumorigenicity of a new epithelial cell line (UOK 257) derived from human renal carcinoma of an individual with Birt-Hogg-Dub   (BHD) syndrome are reported. Unlike other established renal tumor cell lines from sporadic renal cell carcinoma, this is the first established renal tumor cell line of BHD, an inheritable neoplastic syndrome. The isolated tumor cells display loss of contact inhibition in vitro, and produce subcutaneous tumors in mouse xenografts. Histopathologic, ultrastructural, and cytogenetic characterizations of the established tumor cells are reported. Cytogenetic analysis using spectral karyotyping on UOK 257 cells revealed 17p loss and a near-triploid and aneuploid karyotype with multiple fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using a locus-specific gene probe for MYC. The result demonstrates that the established tumor cells consist of two cell populations, one containing four and one containing five copies of the MYC oncogene.	0
23816243	Increased risk of pneumonia among ventilated patients with traumatic brain injury: every day counts! BACKGROUND: Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently require mechanical ventilation (MV). The objective of this study was to examine the association between time spent on MV and the development of pneumonia among patients with TBI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients older than 18  y with head abbreviated injury scale (AIS) scores coded 1-6 requiring MV in the National Trauma Data Bank 2007-2010 data set were included. The study was limited to hospitals reporting pneumonia cases. AIS scores were calculated using ICDMAP-90 software. Patients with injuries in any other region with AIS score >3, significant burns, or a hospital length of stay >30  d were excluded. A generalized linear model was used to determine the approximate relative risk of developing all-cause pneumonia (aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP], and infectious pneumonia identified by the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, diagnosis code) for each day of MV, controlling for age, gender, Glasgow coma scale motor score, comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index) score, insurance status, and injury type and severity. RESULTS: Among the 24,525 patients with TBI who required MV included in this study, 1593 (6.5%) developed all-cause pneumonia. After controlling for demographic and injury factors, each additional day on the ventilator was associated with a 7% increase in the risk of pneumonia (risk ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have sustained TBIs and require MV are at higher risk for VAP than individuals extubated earlier; therefore, shortening MV exposure will likely reduce the risk of VAP. As patients with TBI frequently require MV because of neurologic impairment, it is key to develop aggressive strategies to expedite ventilator independence.	0
20523402	Feasibility of hydroxyl concentration measurements by laser-saturated fluorescence in high-pressure flames. A feasibility study has been performed on the application of laser-saturated fluoresence (LSF) to the measurement of OH concentration in high-pressure flames. Using a numerical model for the collisional dynamics of the OH molecule under nonuniform laser excitation, we have investigated the effect of pressure on the balanced cross-rate model and determined the sensitivity of the depopulation of the laser-coupled levels to the ratio of rate coefficients describing (1) electronic quenching of the vibrational levels for which upsilon'' > 0 and (2) vibrational relaxation from upsilon'' > 0 to upsilon'' = 0. At sufficiently high pressures in near-saturated conditions, the total population of the laser-coupled levels reaches an asymptotic value, which is insensitive to the degree of saturation. When the ratio of electronic quenching is vibrational relaxation is small and the rate coefficients for rotational transfer in the ground and excited electronic states are nearly the same, the balanced cross-rate model remains a good approximation for all pressures. When the above ratio is large, depopulation of the laser-coupled levels becomes significant at high pressures, and thus the balanced crossrate model no longer holds. In these conditions, however, knowledge of the asymptotic value achieved by the laser-coupled levels could be used to correct the balanced cross-rate model and thus allow LSF measurements at sufficiently high pressures.	0
16023714	Semi-synthetic collagen/poloxamine matrices for tissue engineering. Collagen-containing poloxamine hydrogels were produced with the aim of overcoming the low stiffness displayed by collagen gels that are not otherwise chemically crosslinked. Matrices were obtained by functionalization of a four-arm PEO-PPO block copolymer (poloxamine, Tetronic) with methcrylate groups and subsequent free radical polymerization of water solutions of the modified polymer in the presence of collagen. The resulting matrices had a sharp increase in stiffness, when compared to pure collagen gels. For example, whereas collagen had a storage modulus (G') around 70 Pa and a loss modulus (G'') of 10 Pa, a crosslinked collagen/poloxamine system containing 8.3% crosslinked poloxamine had G' and G'' values of 7400 and 1000 Pa, respectively. HepG2 cells were seeded within the gels before the crosslinking and the viability levels estimated by AlamarBlue assay were between 65% and 91% for systems containing 0.04-0.09 wt% photoinitiator. HepG2 and endothelial cells also adhered to and spread on the surface of the collagen-containing specimens, suggesting their potential utility in tissue engineering.	0
8550405	The sea pansy Renilla reniformis luciferase serves as a sensitive bioluminescent reporter for differential gene expression in Candida albicans. The infectious yeast Candida albicans progresses through two developmental programs which involve differential gene expression, the bud-hypha transition and high-frequency phenotypic switching. To understand how differentially expressed genes are regulated in this organism, the promoters of phase-specific genes must be functionally characterized, and a bioluminescent reporter system would facilitate such characterization. However, C. albicans has adopted a nontraditional codon strategy that involves a tRNA with a CAG anticodon to decode the codon CUG as serine rather than leucine. Since the luciferase gene of the sea pansy Renilla reinformis contains no CUGs, we have used it to develop a highly sensitive bioluminescent reporter system for C. albicans. When fused to the galactose-inducible promoter of GAL1, luciferase activity is inducible; when fused to the constitutive EF1 alpha 2 promoter, luciferase activity is constitutive; and when fused to the promoter of the white-phase-specific gene WH11 or the opaque-phase-specific gene OP4, luciferase activity is phase specific. The Renilla luciferase system can, therefore, be used as a bioluminescent reporter to analyze the strength and developmental regulation of C. albicans promoters.	0

19616112	Nitrogen metabolism and branchial osmoregulatory acclimation in the juvenile marble goby, Oxyeleotris marmorata, exposed to seawater. The marble goby, Oxyeleotris marmorata, considered a freshwater fish, was able to hypoosmoregulate successfully during 14 days of acclimation to seawater (30 per thousand) following 6 days of progressive increase in salinity. In seawater, there were slight perturbations in plasma osmolality and ionic concentrations, and significant increases in contents of some free amino acids, which presumably acted as osmolytes, in tissues. The muscle glutamine content increased significantly during seawater acclimation, and the activity and the protein abundance of glutamine synthetase increased significantly in the liver of fish exposed to seawater for 14 days. Exposure to seawater for 14 days also resulted in branchial osmoregulatory acclimation. There were significant increases in the activity and the protein abundance of gill Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, and protein abundance of gill Na(+):K(+):2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC). Immunofluorescence microscopy of branchial Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase-immunoreactive cells revealed that exposure to seawater led to increases in protein expression of apical cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor-like chloride channel and basolateral NKCC. Overall, our results indicate that juvenile marble goby can acclimate to brackish water and subsequently to seawater, and prompt future studies on the effects of salinity on its growth and development which may have important application to the Asian marble goby aquaculture industry.	0
18637784	Getting back into the emergency department: diversifying general practice while relieving emergency medicine workforce shortages. New medical graduates expect to work in an environment that allows scope for flexibility and change across a career in medicine. Recruitment to general practice is adversely affected by its perceived limited scope of practice. Training in procedural and hospital skills is not difficult to access for general practice trainees, but complex and inconsistent credentialling criteria and protectionist attitudes among some specialist colleges mean that many skilled general practitioners are unable to utilise the full range of their skills in clinical practice. The discipline of emergency medicine is also experiencing difficulty in recruiting trainees. The employment of skilled GPs in emergency departments (including metropolitan departments) could improve vocational satisfaction for GPs and emergency physicians, and possibly also improve patient outcomes and flow through the emergency department.	0
19851935	The joint effect of maternal malnutrition and cold weather on neonatal mortality in nineteenth-century Venice: an assessment of the hypothermia hypothesis. Recent studies stress the key role played by neonatal mortality in the demographic regime of north-eastern Italy. In particular, during the period 1700-1830 this area experienced a dramatic upsurge in winter neonatal deaths, pushing overall neonatal and infant mortality rates to the highest in Italy and most of Europe. Scholars have argued that this trend was caused by a general pauperization leading to widespread maternal malnutrition, low birth weight, and an increased frequency of winter neonatal deaths caused by the higher sensitivity of low-birth-weight infants to the cold. The study presented here tested this hypothesis using a large mid-nineteenth-century longitudinal sample of the Venetian population. Two alternative measures of maternal malnutrition were applied: chronic undernourishment and temporary nutritional stress during late gestation. Only the second condition is significantly associated with higher neonatal mortality when outside temperatures were low. This is consistent with mechanisms of neonatal thermoregulation but casts doubt on the pauperization hypothesis suggested by other studies.	0
12717822	Fine tuning the HIF-1 'global' O2 sensor for hypobaric hypoxia in Andean high-altitude natives. Included in the acute response of lowlanders exposed to reduced oxygen availability is an elevated red blood cell count due to increased erythropoietin (Epo) synthesis. According to current thinking, hypoxia is \"sensed\" by hydroxylases that permit Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) to complex with HIF-1beta to form a transcriptional activator (HIF-1) that drives expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes (such as EPO) under hypoxic conditions. In altitude-adapted Andean natives, the Epo hypoxic response may be blunted; however, our data indicate that the DNA sequences of the genes encoding Epo (including the 3' regulatory region) and HIF-1alpha appear to be conserved. Hence, adaptive changes in the Andean hypoxic response are not a consequence of changes in the primary sequence of these proteins or of known transcriptional regulatory domains of EPO. These results suggest that the altered erthropoietic response in Andean natives reflects adaptations in hypoxia sensing, rather than hypoxia response, mechanisms.	0
23002320	Molecular Characterization of A(1) and A(2a) Adenosine Receptors. Detailed amino acid sequence analyses of A(1) and A(2a) adenosine receptors were assembled by analogy to other G-protein-coupled receptors and correlated with pharmacological observations. Sites for phosphorylation, palmitoylation, and sodium binding have been proposed. Striatal A(2a) receptors from human and other species were photoaffinity-labeled using the selective, radioiodinated agonist PAPA-APEC. Selective chemical affinity labels for A(1) and A(2a) receptors have been introduced. For example, an isothiocyanate, p-DITC-APEC (100 nM), irreversibly diminished the B(max) for [(3)H]CGS 21680 (2-[4-[(2-carboxyethyl) phenyl] ethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) binding in rabbit striatal membranes by 71% (K(d) unaffected), suggesting a direct modification of the ligand binding site. Novel trifunctional affinity labels have been designed. Rabbit and human A(2a) receptors were characterized using [(3)H]XAC binding in the presence of 50 or 25 nM CPX (8-cyclopentyl-l,3-dipropylxanthine), respectively. The inhibition of A(2) radioligand binding by the histidyl-modifying reagent diethylpyrocarbonate suggested the involvement of His residues in interactions with adenosine agonists and antagonists. Properties of transiently expressed mutants of bovine A(1) receptors in which either His(251) or His(278) residues have been substituted with Leu suggest that both histidines are important in binding.	0
12141764	Birds and Borrelia. After several years of controversy, the contribution of birds in the ecology of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) has become more and more obvious on the three continents where the pathogens are distributed. Evidence of the reservoir competence of particular bird species has been obtained using tick xenodiagnosis. B. burgdorferi sl circulates not only in terrestrial environment involving Ixodes ricinus and undergrowth-frequenting birds but also in marine environment involving I. uriae and seabirds. Migrating birds contribute to the spread of B. burgdorferi sl and of infected tick vectors along migration routes.	0
8015909	[Crisis intervention and requests for organ donation--impossible to reconcile?]. A request for organ donation after a patient's death imposes a strong emotional impact both on the family and on the medical staff. How well the family copes with the loss of a close relative is subject to a variety of factors including the immediate emotional support provided by the staff. On the other hand, a donation request, if made with sensitivity, may in combination with adequate psychological support facilitate the grieving process. Health care professionals need emotional support and training to help them deal with the difficulties of caring for bereaved families, of breaking bad news, and of making organ donation requests.	0

15581908	Endurance treadmill training in rats alters CRH activity in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus at rest and during acute running according to its period. Running training on the treadmill increases the resting hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) content in rats, though is still unknown whether and how it occurs in the parvocellular region of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) where is a predominant region of pituitary-adrenal activity and where CRH and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are colocalized. We thus aimed at examining whether treadmill training would alter the CRH and AVP mRNA levels in the PVN at rest and during acute running with different lengths of a training regime. Male Wistar rats were subjected to treadmill running (approximately 25 m/min, 60 minutes/day, 5 times/week) for training regimes of 0, 1, 2 or 4 weeks. All training regimes induced an adrenal hypertrophy. Plasma corticosterone levels before acute running increased with lengthening the training period. Four weeks of training produced a significant increase in the resting CRH, but not AVP, mRNA levels in the PVN though relatively shorter training regimes did not. Acute responses of lactate and ACTH release were reduced after 2 and 4 weeks of training, respectively. The responsive PVN CRH mRNA level to acute running decreased with 4 weeks of training but increased with relatively shorter training regimes. These results indicate that running training changes the PVN CRH biosynthetic activity with the regime lasting for 4 weeks, which follows adaptive changes in adrenal functions. Thus, running training-induced changes in hypothalamic CRH activity would originate from the PVN and be induced according to the training period.	0
20082358	c-Rel but not NF-kappaB1 is important for T regulatory cell development. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are crucial for maintaining peripheral tolerance and controlling T-cell responses. The generation of Treg in the thymus requires TCR triggering and CD28 costimulation. Engagement of these receptors induces a number of signalling pathways, including the activation of NF-kappaB via PKCtheta and the Bcl-10/CARMA1/MALT complex. Previous studies have shown that PKCtheta, Bcl-10 and CARMA1 are important for Treg development. It is unclear, however, whether different members of the NF-kappaB family contribute to Treg development or homeostasis. In this study, we show that Treg numbers are reduced in the absence of c-Rel but not NF-kappaB1 (p50). Furthermore, using mixed bone marrow chimeras from WT and KO animals, we demonstrate that the requirement for PKCtheta, Bcl-10 and c-Rel is T-cell intrinsic, and cannot be rescued by the presence of WT cells. Therefore, c-Rel and NF-kappaB1 have differential roles in Treg development.	0
16946445	Nonoperative management of spleen and liver injuries. The spleen and liver are the 2 most commonly injured abdominal organs following trauma. Trends in management have changed over the years, and the majority of these injuries are now managed nonoperatively. Splenic injuries can be managed via simple observation or with angiography and embolization. Recent data suggest that there are few true contraindications in the setting of hemodynamic stability. Success rate of nonoperative management may be as high as 95%. Liver injuries can be approached similarly. In the setting of a hemodynamically stable patient, observation with or without angiography and embolization may similarly be used. As many as 80% of patients with liver injury can be successfully managed without laparotomy. This review will discuss current concepts in nonoperative management of liver and spleen, including diagnosis, patient selection, nonoperative management strategies, benefits, risks, and complications.	0
23549505	The effect of nano-scale topography on osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. BACKGROUND: Large bone defects resulting from trauma or disease pose a threat to humans. Thus far, tissue engineering as an important clinical approach uses cells, growth factors and scaffolds to regenerate large areas of damaged bone tissue. Since bone is a nanocomposite structure, it is assumed that nanomaterial scaffolds can induce or promote osteogenesis by mimicking the cell niche at nano level. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this review we highlighted the effect of nano-scale topography on osteogenic differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) as potent cell candidates in bone engineered constructs. The key point in the induction of differentiation by nanomaterials is the discontinuity in their topography. This leads to alteration in protein adsorption and restriction of extracellular matrix deposition by the cells and consequently leads to changes in cell morphology and the frequency of accessible sites for cell adhesion. Here, we have reviewed the literature on the role of different types of nanomateial scaffolds in osteogenic differentiation of these cells. Since little is known about the underlying molecular networks induced by nanomaterials, we also reviewed possible underlying mechanisms of nanotopographical effects on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Nano-scale materials provide a niche which is very similar to native bone in geometry and stiffness. Such nano-scale topographies improve the function of MSC-based engineered constructs in regeneration of bone defects.	0

We report NMR and molecular modelling studies on a DNA duplex structure which is composed of three oligonucleotides and mimics a strand break. Although it retains a B form conformation our model suggests that it is kinked at the strand break. In the same sequence with an extra bulged adenosine at the centre for the major species this residue is stacked in the helix and a kink is observed in the model.	0

Moraxella spp., Pasteurella spp., and strains of P. anatipestifer were tested for biochemical reactions, growth temperature, viability, antibacterial sensitivity, and DNA base composition. P. anatipestifer was viable for shorter periods at 37 C, showed high resistance to polymyxin B and kanamycin, and had lower base composition than reported for Moraxella and Pasteurella spp. Because of these conditions, P. anatipestifer should be excluded from the genera Pasteurella and Moraxella.	0
15631597	Capacity limitations and the detection of correlations: comment on Kareev (2000). Y. Kareev (2000) argued that the limited capacity of working memory may be an adaptive advantage for the early detection of useful correlations. His analysis indeed suggests that the optimal sample size is close to G. A. Miller's (1956) \"magical number 7 +/- 2.\" The authors point out logical and statistical limitations of Y. Kareev's (2000) analysis, including that it neglects that the adaptive value is not determined by the hit rate but by the posterior probability of hit and that only signal trials are considered. The authors' analysis demonstrates that when these limitations are corrected for, the alleged benefit for small samples does not occur, and larger samples imply considerable improvement in the detection of correlations.	0

20586409	Transition from isolated to collective modes in plasmonic oligomers. We demonstrate the transition from isolated to collective optical modes in plasmonic oligomers. Specifically, we investigate the resonant behavior of planar plasmonic hexamers and heptamers with gradually decreasing the interparticle gap separation. A pronounced Fano resonance is observed in the plasmonic heptamer for separations smaller than 60 nm. The spectral characteristics change drastically upon removal of the central nanoparticle. Our work paves the road toward complex hierarchical plasmonic oligomers with tailored optical properties.	0
12530603	Fungi genus and concentration in the air of onion fields and their opportunistic action related to mycotic keratitis. The authors determined fungi concentrations and genera from onion fields located in monsoon and nonmonsoon areas of Taiwan, as well as concentrations from a county housing location, which served as the comparison site. The authors explored the relationship(s) among onion harvesting, monsoon characteristics, airborne fungal levels, and mycotic eye infection. Airborne fungal levels in the onion field in the nonmonsoon area were the highest, followed by decreasing levels in the monsoon area and control sites, regardless of the sampling periods. The geometric mean of airborne fungal concentrations was the highest during onion harvesting. Cladosporium was the most dominant fungus during pre- and postharvest seasons, whereas Aspergillus, Fusraium, Acremonium, Alternaria, Penicillium, Monilia, Mycelia, and Rhizopus were increased significantly during harvesting. Although fungal concentrations in monsoon onion fields were lower than concentrations measured in the nonmonsoon area, the invasion of dangerous fungal pathogens following eye trauma by airborne sharp exotics (e.g., onion flakes) dispersed in high wind may account for the increase in corneal ulcer cases that occur in the monsoon area.	0

Morphological study of 120 autopsy cases of newborns who died of intrauterine pneumonia, respiratory distress, hemorrhage into the brain ventricles and asphyxia revealed that in all these diseases intravascular blood coagulation develops which can be disseminated or local. Morphological manifestations of DIC-syndrome in newborns are described. The development of DIC-syndrome 18-24 hours before death is considered as a sign of compensatory-adaptive failure at the level of microcirculatory bed (type of \"blood degeneration\").	0
19326283	Increased cerebrospinal fluid Helicobacter pylori antibody in Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AIM: A prospective, nonrandomized, comparative study was car- ried out to examine the levels of anti-H. pylori-specific IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of AD patients, compared with those of age-matched cognitively normal controls. PATIENTS: CSF was aspirated from 27 AD patients and 27 age-matched cognitively normal patients with prostate hyperplasia or long-bone fractures necessitating surgery after epidural anesthesia. Serum samples were obtained from AD patients and the day before surgery from controls. METHODS: CSF and serum anti-H. pylori IgG concentrations were measured by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The mean concentration of anti-H. pylori-specific IgG was significantly greater in (a) the CSF of AD patients (10.53 +/- 12.54 U/mL) than in controls (8.63 +/- 8.01 U/mL, p = 0.047), and (b) the serum of AD patients (30.44 +/- 33.94 U/mL) than in controls (16.24 +/- 5.77 U/mL, p = 0.041). CSF anti-H. pylori IgG antibodies correlated with the degree of severity of the disease. CONCLUSION: H. pylori-specific IgG antibody levels are significantly increased in CSF and serum of AD; its titer in CSF might reflect the AD severity, thereby supporting a role for this common infection in the pathobiology of the disease.	0
6874437	Alternating cerebral hemispheric activity and the lateralization of autonomic nervous function. Alternating dominance of cerebral hemispheric activity was demonstrated in humans by use of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Relative changes of electrocortical activity have a direct correlation with changes in the relative nostril dominance, the so-called nasal cycle. The nasal cycle is a phenomenon where efficiency of breathing alternates predominantly through right or left nostril with a periodicity ranging from 25 to greater than 200 minutes. Relatively greater integrated EEG value in one hemisphere correlates with predominant airflow in the contralateral nostril, defining a new interrelationship between cerebral dominance and peripheral autonomic nervous function.	0

7223672	Glomerular architectural changes after a two-hour infusion of norepinephrine. Alterations in glomerular architecture have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of several models of acute renal failure. In this study, mongrel dogs were subjected to an intrarenal infusion of norepinephrine for 2 hours. Light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to describe glomerular architecture 2 days after the initial norepinephrine infusion. In addition, scanning electron microscopy was used to quantitate the percentage of \"abnormal areas\" in glomerular capillary-loop morphology in both norepinephrine-infused kidneys and the contralateral control kidneys. Alterations in glomerular structure in these experiments appeared to be much less extensive than previously reported. A variable amount of glomerular pedical shape simplification was seen, which involved about 15% of the capillary loop. Quantitative evaluation revealed abnormal morphology of 15.2% +/- 0.6% of the glomerular capillary loop in the norepinephrine-infused kidneys, compared to 2.9% +/- 0.4 abnormal loop structure in the contralateral control kidneys (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that alterations in glomerular structure are not extensive in this model.	0
15709721	Selective cerebral revascularization as an adjunct in the treatment of giant anterior circulation aneurysms. Cerebral revascularization, an indispensable component of neurovascular surgery, has been performed in the treatment of cranial base tumors, complex cerebral aneurysms, and occlusive cerebrovascular disease. The goal of a revascularization procedure is to augment blood flow distally. It can therefore be used as an adjunctive measure in the treatment of complex neurosurgical disease processes that require parent artery sacrifice for definitive treatment. In the treatment of giant anterior circulation aneurysms, for instance, a cerebral revascularization procedure may be considered in patients in whom the collateral circulation is marginal and in whom lesions may be treated either using a Hunterian-based strategy or clip-assisted reconstruction requiring a prolonged period of temporary occlusion. To date, there is no entirely effective method known to produce long-term tolerance to carotid artery (CA) sacrifice and, largely for that reason, some neurovascular surgeons advocate universal revascularization. The authors of this report, however, prefer to perform revascularization only in the limited subset of patients in whom preoperative assessment has revealed risk factors for cerebral ischemia due to hypoperfusion. In this paper, the authors introduce their protocol for assessing cerebrovascular reserve capacity, indications for cerebral revascularization in the treatment of complex anterior circulation aneurysms, and discuss their rationale for choosing to practice selective, rather than universal, revascularization.	0
14500000	Spectrofluorimetric method for the estimation of total lipids in Eremothecium ashbyii fungal filaments using Nile blue and avoiding interference of autofluorescent riboflavin. A rapid, simple and sensitive spectrofluorimetric technique was developed for monitoring total lipids in hyphae of the riboflavin-overproducing fungus Eremothecium ashbyii using the fluorescent probe Nile blue in an aqueous system, avoiding the interference due to autofluorescent riboflavin. The existing methodologies for lipid estimation are tedious, requiring large biomass, solvent extraction and gravimetry. E. ashbyii is a hemiascomycete fungus which accumulates lipids in its mycelia prior to flavinogenesis. This study defines the conditions (wavelength selection and sensitivity) for the spectrofluorimetric quantification of lipids in situ in the macerated mycelia of this fungus in the presence of intracellular autofluorescent riboflavin without the need to extract the lipids from the mycelia. The fluorescent intensity was linear with the lipid concentration of the mycelia (by gravimetry) under three different growth conditions using glucose, olive oil and sunflower oil as carbon sources. This spectrofluorimetic method of lipid estimation can be applied to other fungi and microorganisms.	0
19875853	A statistical change point model approach for the detection of DNA copy number variations in array CGH data. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) provides a high-resolution and high-throughput technique for screening of copy number variations (CNVs) within the entire genome. This technique, compared to the conventional CGH, significantly improves the identification of chromosomal abnormalities. However, due to the random noise inherited in the imaging and hybridization process, identifying statistically significant DNA copy number changes in aCGH data is challenging. We propose a novel approach that uses the mean and variance change point model (MVCM) to detect CNVs or breakpoints in aCGH data sets. We derive an approximate p-value for the test statistic and also give the estimate of the locus of the DNA copy number change. We carry out simulation studies to evaluate the accuracy of the estimate and the p-value formulation. These simulation results show that the approach is effective in identifying copy number changes. The approach is also tested on fibroblast cancer cell line data, breast tumor cell line data, and breast cancer cell line aCGH data sets that are publicly available. Changes that have not been identified by the circular binary segmentation (CBS) method but are biologically verified are detected by our approach on these cell lines with higher sensitivity and specificity than CBS.	0
12087759	[Asthma insights _ reality in Japan (AIRJ)]. The asthma insights _ reality in Japan survey was aimed to assess the current status of asthma treatment and management in Japan. We used random digit dialing to identify current asthmatics in households throughout Japan. Throughout Japan, 38,132 households were contacted. A detailed survey on asthma management was conducted among 803 of these households, 401 adults and 402 children. More than half had experienced a daytime asthma attack during the previous month. More than one third had experienced an asthma attack at night during that same period. About 70% of the adults and 60% of the children with asthma reported some limitation on activities of daily life. About 50% of adults and 80% of children had never undergone any pulmonary function testing. Only 6% of adults and 7% of children's parents were aware that \"airway inflammation\" was a major cause of asthma. Moreover, only 12% of adults and 5% of children were using inhaled steroids. There was an especially large gap between subjective perception of asthma control and objective findings in patients with severe asthma. Many Japanese asthmatics tended to underestimate the severity of their condition. Asthma management in Japan falls far short of goals stated in the guideline. These findings emphasize the need for increased awareness of the burden of asthma in Japan.	0
12172367	Characteristics of hepatitis C in renal transplant candidates. GOALS: To characterize hepatitis C in renal transplant candidates and to compare hepatitis C-related liver disease between patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and well-matched control subjects without renal disease. BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C is common in dialysis patients and can cause morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. Patients with advanced hepatitis C often are excluded from renal transplantation. STUDY: Forty-six renal transplant candidates and 46 control subjects matched for age, sex, and race without renal disease were included. Demographic, laboratory, and histologic data were compared between patients with ESRD and control subjects. RESULTS: Alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly lower in patients with ESRD (p < 0.001). Hepatitis C virus RNA levels were similar between groups. Patients with ESRD had less inflammatory activity (p < 0.001) and a lower proportion of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (13%) than control subjects (30%, p = 0.043). Clinical and laboratory features did not predict histologic grade or stage of hepatitis C in patients with ESRD. Two complications of percutaneous liver biopsy occurred per three diagnoses of cirrhosis in patients with ESRD. No complications occurred with transjugular liver biopsy in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESRD had less severe hepatitis C than did control subjects. Clinical measurements did not predict histologic findings in renal transplant candidates. Transjugular liver biopsy should be considered to stage hepatitis C in renal transplant candidates due to the risk of percutaneous biopsy in uremic patients.	0
22093159	Loss of sensory and noradrenergic innervation in benign colorectal adenomatous polyps--a putative role of semaphorins 3F and 3A. BACKGROUND: Nerve fibers can exert trophic/anti-trophic effects on epithelial cells. Substance P (SP) is a pro-proliferative neuropeptide, whereas sympathetic noradrenaline is anti-proliferative at high concentrations. METHODS: Density of noradrenergic and sensory nerve fibers and presence of nerve repellent factors specific for noradrenergic (semaphorin 3F) and sensory nerve fibers (semaphorin 3A) were investigated in colorectal adenomas. KEY RESULTS: The pedunculus was innervated by noradrenergic fibers, whereas the mucosa was sparsely innervated. The control submucosa compared with control mucosa demonstrated increased density of noradrenergic fibers. Control tissue was much better innervated than the polyp. This was accompanied by strong expression of semaphorin 3F in epithelial cells. Density of sensory SP+ nerve fibers was higher in control colon mucosa compared with polyp mucosa, and SP+ cell clusters and semaphorin 3A-positive cells appeared in the intercrypt space in polyps, but not in control tissue. CONCLUSIONS _ INFERENCES: This study demonstrated a marked loss of noradrenergic and sensory nerve fibers in polyp mucosa, which was associated with a strong increase of semaphorin 3F and 3A. Up-regulation of the sympathetic repellent semaphorin 3F in the polyps possibly triggers sympathetic repulsion and polyp growth due to the loss of anti-proliferative noradrenaline and presence of SP from local SP+ cells.	0
23727723	The effect of visible facial difference on personal space during encounters with the general public. Previous research has found that people with visible differences are granted more physical space than people without visible differences during encounters with the general public. This study aimed to examine whether given significant sociocultural changes, this remains the case in contemporary Australia. The personal space afforded to a person with a visible difference (with a temporary difference--a scar and a permanent difference--a strawberry hemangioma) or a person without a visible difference by 408 pedestrians on a busy pedestrian walkway in the central business district of Adelaide, Australia, was measured. This was a replication and extension of a study by N. Rumsey, R. Bull, and D. Gahagan (1982). Pedestrians stood no further away from the model in the visibly different conditions than in the nonvisibly different conditions. Pedestrians stood an average of 128 cm away in the control condition, 120 cm away in the scar condition, and 140 cm away in the birthmark condition. People did not stand to the nonvisibly different (left) side of the model more frequently in the visibly different conditions than in the nonvisibly different conditions. As the original research by N. Rumsey et al. is frequently cited as representing the current situation for people with visible differences, failing to replicate the result is significant. Changes may be due to either recent sociocultural changes promoting inclusion of disability or increasing social taboo against expressing overt prejudice.	0

24183168	Metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis after curative treatment of colorectal cancer. INTRODUCTION: Population-based data on metachronous peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) after curative resection of colorectal origin are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for developing metachronous PC from colorectal cancer as well as survival since diagnosis of PC. METHODS: Data on metachronous metastases were collected between 2010 and 2011 for all patients diagnosed with M0 colorectal cancer between 2003 and 2008 in the Dutch Eindhoven Cancer Registry. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Survival was defined as time from metastases diagnosis to death. RESULTS: Of the 5671 colorectal cancer patients, 1042 (18%) were diagnosed with metachronous metastases of whom 197 (19%) developed metachronous PC. The peritoneal surface was the only site of metastasis in 81 (41%) patients while 116 (59%) patients were diagnosed with  both PC and metastases elsewhere. Median survival after diagnosis of PC was 6 months compared to 15 months for patients with distant metastases in other organs. Patients with an advanced primary tumour stage, positive lymph nodes at initial diagnosis, primary mucinous adenocarcinoma, positive resection margin and a primary tumour located in the colon were at increased risk of developing metachronous PC. CONCLUSION: Of the colorectal cancer patients who developed metachronous metastases, approximately one fifth is diagnosed with PC. Prognosis of these patients is poor with a median survival of 6 months after diagnosis. Identifying patients at high risk for developing metachronous PC is important as it may contribute to more accurate patient information, tailor-made follow-up schemes, and more adequate treatment.	0

10838434	Stacker Modules Used in a High-Capacity Robotics System for High Throughput Screening Compound Replication. High throughput screening is now established as a key component of the pharmaceutical lead identification process in many pharmaceutical companies. Over recent years, thanks to advances in assay technology, process automation, and logistics control, the throughput capacity of HTS groups has increased significantly. It is now entirely possible to screen corporate compound collections against an individual pharmacological target within a timescale of several weeks. Despite these improvements, many HTS groups find that their capacity is limited by the rate at which they can provide test compounds in a \"screen-ready\" format. This limitation is usually imposed by the capacity and productivity of the single-armed robotic systems utilized. We have recently constructed a robotic system aimed at overcoming this particular problem. This system uses purpose-built microplate stacker units that provide high-capacity microplate storage and, importantly, provide an easy and fast interface between the robotic system and the human operators. This paper describes this automation project and the benefits that have resulted from its deployment.	0

11527903	Sperm swim-up techniques and DNA fragmentation. BACKGROUND: Swim-up techniques for sperm separation may have detrimental effects on sperm DNA. We wished to determine whether the normal swim-up method with centrifugation used in our laboratory, which involves a centrifugation step, was harmful to sperm compared with swim-up without centrifugation. METHODS: Semen samples were obtained from patients undergoing IVF or andrology assessment. An aliquot was removed for fixation and subsequent DNA fragmentation determination. The remaining sample was divided into two equal parts, which were subjected to swim-up either with (normal swim-up) or without (direct-swim-up) centrifugation. Semen analysis was performed both before and after swim-up. DNA fragmentation, in spermatozoa previously fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, was assessed by the terminal transferase-mediated DNA end-labelling procedure (TUNEL). The percentage of spermatozoa with DNA damage after each swim-up technique was compared with that in the original semen sample. RESULTS: DNA damage was <5% in most samples. No significant change in DNA fragmentation was observed between the two swim-up procedures, although the 'normal' swim-up sample had significantly less DNA fragmentation than the pre-swim-up sample. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that our normal swim-up technique caused no more DNA damage to spermatozoa from normal semen samples than a direct swim-up technique that involved no centrifugation step.	0
17101260	Geographically-based evaluation of multidrug resistance trends among Streptococcus pneumoniae in the USA: findings of the FAST surveillance initiative (2003-2004). Surveillance initiatives to track Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance trends are important for understanding the current in vitro effectiveness of available antimicrobial agents. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of S. pneumoniae (n=1479 isolates) collected from 17 geographical areas across the USA (2003-2004) were analysed; 36.8% of isolates were resistant to one or more agents (24.4% were multidrug-resistant, i.e. resistant to two or more antimicrobial classes). Multidrug resistance involved resistance to beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, but rarely fluoroquinolones (>96% of multidrug-resistant isolates were fluoroquinolone-susceptible). Multidrug resistance rates were prominent regardless of the geographical region surveyed. As this trend continues, the empirical therapeutic options for S. pneumoniae infections will diminish and there will be an ongoing need to evaluate the effectiveness of potent fluoroquinolones such as gemifloxacin.	0
11239874	Resolution of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis in an AIDS patient treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. PURPOSE: To report the outcome of microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after highly active antiretroviral therapy without any specific treatment for microsporidiosis. METHODS: Case report. A 42-year-old woman diagnosed with AIDS and severe immunodepression (CD4+ of 9 cells/mm(3) and viral load of 460,000/mm(3)), antiretroviral naive, presented with cerebral toxoplasmosis and microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis in the right eye documented by conjunctival scraping and electron microscopy. RESULTS: The patient was treated with a combination of indinavir, stavudine, and lamivudine, besides sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. No specific treatment for the microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis was attempted. One month later, the keratoconjunctivitis had disappeared. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis in the setting of AIDS and severe immunodepression can be effectively managed with highly active antiretroviral therapy alone.	0
20057156	High-throughput and highly sensitive analysis method for polyisoprene in plants by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Natural polyisoprene is a biopolymer consisting of isoprene units (C(5)H(8)) that is used commercially in household, medical, and industrial materials. For the management of natural polyisoprene production, the selection of high-yield polyisoprene-producing trees, and an understanding of polyisoprene biosynthesis, a high-throughput and highly sensitive screening method for the quantification of polyisoprene is required. In this study, we examined pyrolysates from polyisoprenes, polyprenols, carotenoids, ubiquinone (CoQ-10), and sterols by pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PyGC/MS) and determined that the amounts of isoprene and limonene released from polyprenols and polyisoprenes were dependent upon their molecular weights. Based on these results, we developed a relative quantification method for polyisoprene in leaves by direct analysis of 1 mg of leaves using PyGC/MS. This novel quantification method eliminated extraction steps and can be used in the measurement of polyisoprene contents in Eucommia ulmoides and Hevea brasiliensis.	0
19812331	Temporal order processing of syllables in the left parietal lobe. Speech processing requires the temporal parsing of syllable order. Individuals suffering from posterior left hemisphere brain injury often exhibit temporal processing deficits as well as language deficits. Although the right posterior inferior parietal lobe has been implicated in temporal order judgments (TOJs) of visual information, there is limited evidence to support the role of the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) in processing syllable order. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the left inferior parietal lobe is recruited during temporal order judgments of speech stimuli. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected on 14 normal participants while they completed the following forced-choice tasks: (1) syllable order of multisyllabic pseudowords, (2) syllable identification of single syllables, and (3) gender identification of both multisyllabic and monosyllabic speech stimuli. Results revealed increased neural recruitment in the left inferior parietal lobe when participants made judgments about syllable order compared with both syllable identification and gender identification. These findings suggest that the left inferior parietal lobe plays an important role in processing syllable order and support the hypothesized role of this region as an interface between auditory speech and the articulatory code. Furthermore, a breakdown in this interface may explain some components of the speech deficits observed after posterior damage to the left hemisphere.	0
17801530	Catastrophes, phase shifts, and large-scale degradation of a Caribbean coral reef. Many coral reefs have been degraded over the past two to three decades through a combination of human and natural disturbances. In Jamaica, the effects of overfishing, hurricane damage, and disease have combined to destroy most corals, whose abundance has declined from more than 50 percent in the late 1970s to less than 5 percent today. A dramatic phase shift has occurred, producing a system dominated by fleshy macroalgae (more than 90 percent cover). Immediate implementation of management procedures is necessary to avoid further catastrophic damage.	0
12242286	The myostatin gene is a downstream target gene of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor MyoD. Myostatin is a negative regulator of myogenesis, and inactivation of myostatin leads to heavy muscle growth. Here we have cloned and characterized the bovine myostatin gene promoter. Alignment of the upstream sequences shows that the myostatin promoter is highly conserved during evolution. Sequence analysis of 1.6 kb of the bovine myostatin gene upstream region revealed that it contains 10 E-box motifs (E1 to E10), arranged in three clusters, and a single MEF2 site. Deletion and mutation analysis of the myostatin gene promoter showed that out of three important E boxes (E3, E4, and E6) of the proximal cluster, E6 plays a significant role in the regulation of a reporter gene in C(2)C(12) cells. We also demonstrate by band shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay that the E6 E-box motif binds to MyoD in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, cotransfection experiments indicate that among the myogenic regulatory factors, MyoD preferentially up-regulates myostatin promoter activity. Since MyoD expression varies during the myoblast cell cycle, we analyzed the myostatin promoter activity in synchronized myoblasts and quiescent \"reserve\" cells. Our results suggest that myostatin promoter activity is relatively higher during the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, when MyoD expression levels are maximal. However, in the reserve cells, which lack MyoD expression, a significant reduction in the myostatin promoter activity is observed. Taken together, these results suggest that the myostatin gene is a downstream target gene of MyoD. Since the myostatin gene is implicated in controlling G(1)-to-S progression of myoblasts, MyoD could be triggering myoblast withdrawal from the cell cycle by regulating myostatin gene expression.	1

17391089	Drug-eluting coronary stents--a note of caution. There are two types of coronary stents: bare-metal stents (BMS) that cost about  800 each, and drug-eluting stents (DES) that cost about  3,300 each. DES reduce the rate of restenosis but have a higher incidence of late stent thrombosis, particularly if dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is interrupted. Stent thrombosis has a myocardial infarction rate of 70% and a mortality rate of 31%-45%. Randomised studies of BMS versus DES show no increase in myocardial infarction or death with DES in simple coronary lesions, but in clinical practice, DES are mainly used in complex coronary disease where the rate of stent thrombosis is higher. Registry data suggest an increased rate of death and myocardial infarction of 0.5%-1.0% per annum with DES. Clinicians need to be aware of the risks associated with prematurely ceasing dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with DES.	0

11265440	Behavioral characteristics of infants with nonorganic failure to thrive during a play interaction. PURPOSE: To examine the behavioral responses of infants with nonorganic failure to thrive (NOFTT) during play interactions with their mothers. DESIGN: Comparative descriptive. METHODS: The sample consisted of 31 infants; 17 with nonorganic failure to thrive (NOFTT) and 16 matched healthy controls. The infants were videotaped during a play interaction with their mothers. The behaviors exhibited by the infants were scored with the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment. The environmental context of the play interaction was also rated for how play was initiated, maternal involvement, and the presence of chaos. RESULTS: Infants with NOFTT exhibited more difficult behaviors during play such as more negative affect, less vocalizing, and more gaze aversion. Mothers of the infants with NOFTT were less likely to remain involved during the play interaction. The environments of the infants with NOFTT were also found to be more chaotic during play. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Assessment of the infant-mother interaction during play may provide insight into the interactions that occur during other caretaking activities. Strategies could be developed to assist the mother with interacting with her difficult infant. Future research could lead to interventions that could help improve the dynamics of the infant-mother interaction in infants with NOFTT.	0
15144464	Topical treatment with aqueous solutions of rofleponide palmitate and budesonide in a pollen-season model of allergic rhinitis. BACKGROUND: Rofleponide palmitate is an esterified glucocorticosteroid pro-drug with a promising pre-clinical profile designed to deliver topical airway treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma in a novel manner. Thus, the rofleponide palmitate pro-drug is designed to provide topical exposure of the mucosa to the inactive lipophilic drug, which would be locally metabolized to the more hydrophilic and readily cleared drug rofleponide. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether rofleponide palmitate affects nasal symptoms and peak inspiratory flow (PIF) in a pollen-season model of allergic rhinitis and to compare any such effects with those of another glucocorticosteroid (i.e., budesonide). METHODS: During the pollen-free season, 40 patients with strictly seasonal allergic rhinitis received topical nasal spray treatment with an aqueous solution of rofleponide palmitate 400 microg and an aqueous solution of budesonide 128 microg once daily for 10 days in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and crossover study. After 3 days of drug treatment, individualized allergen challenges were given once daily for 7 days while the treatment continued. The washout periods between each of the challenge series were 2 weeks. Nasal symptoms and PIF were recorded in the morning and evening, as well as 10 and 20 min after each allergen challenge. The mean recordings obtained during the last 3 days of the allergen-challenge series, when symptoms were established and when the treatment had lasted for 8-10 days, were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Both active treatments reduced nasal symptoms and improved nasal PIF compared with placebo (P<0.01-0.001). There was no overall difference in efficacy between rofleponide palmitate 400 microg and budesonide 128 microg. CONCLUSIONS: Topical treatment with aqueous solutions of rofleponide palmitate attenuates nasal symptoms and improves nasal PIF in allergic rhinitis. The overall efficacy of 400 microg of rofleponide palmitate is similar to that of 128 microg of budesonide in the pollen-season model used in this study.	0

9013051	Frontal midline theta rhythm in young healthy adults. In this study, we examined the relationship between the frontal midline (Fm) theta rhythm that appears when a healthy subject is engaged in mental tasks and the theta rhythm which appears in the frontal region of healthy subjects during light drowsiness. The samples for this study were obtained from 465 EEGs of healthy Japan Air Self Defense Force personnel. The 39 who had frontal theta rhythm during light drowsiness were selected to be included in the theta group. For the control group, 34 subjects were randomly selected from the remaining 426 without frontal theta rhythm. When these subjects were reexamined, the rate of appearance of the frontal midline theta rhythm which appears during light drowsiness was 87.2% in the theta group and 0% in the control group. The rate of appearance of the Fm theta was 94.9% in the theta group and 3.0% in the control group. The two types of frontal theta rhythms closely resembled each other in frequency (94.6%) and distribution (83.8%). Except for the results of the hypomania (Ma) scores, there was no remarkable difference between the two groups when the MMPI was administered. The results of our study suggest that there is a close correlation between the frontal theta rhythm that appears during light drowsiness and the Fm theta.	0
22820432	The involvement of nitric oxide in the physiopathology of hepatoportal sclerosis. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Hepatoportal sclerosis (HPS) is a clinical syndrome of unspecified etiology depicted by enlarged spleen and portal hypertension in the lack of other chronic liver disease findings, hematological disorders or any infectious disease in the liver. Nitric oxide (NO) molecule has many important functions in human body including phagocytosis in macrophages, neural transmission and endothelial relaxation. Although there is no data in literature that depicts the role of NO in HPS pathogenesis, this study was conducted in order to evaluate the potential role of NO in patients with HPS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study participants included 24 HPS patients and 20 healthy controls. The median age of HPS and control patients was 41.2    13.9 and 46.5    12.4 years, respectively. NO was predicted as nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) by Griess reaction after transformation of nitrate to nitrite by nitrate reductase using the commercially obtainable Nitric Oxide Assay Kit. RESULTS: Serum NOx levels were 2.69    2.98  mol/L and 0.85    1.05  mol/L for the HPS patients and controls, respectively. Serum NO levels were significantly higher in patients with HPS compared to the control group (p<0.001). ROC curve analysis suggested that the optimum NOx cut-off point for HPS was 1.305 with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 83.3%, 90 %, 90.9 %, and 81.8% respectively. CONCLUSION: Circulating NO concentration was notably higher in patients with HPS in comparison to the control group. Our study verified that an elevated level of NO might have a role in the pathogenesis of HPS.	0
15457527	mRNA openers and closers: modulating AU-rich element-controlled mRNA stability by a molecular switch in mRNA secondary structure. Approximately 3 000 genes are regulated in a time-, tissue-, and stimulus-dependent manner by degradation or stabilization of their mRNAs. The process is mediated by interaction of AU-rich elements (AREs) in the mRNA's 3'-untranslated regions with trans-acting factors. AU-rich element-controlled genes of fundamentally different functional relevance depend for their activation on one positive regulator, HuR. Here we present a methodology to exploit this central regulatory process for specific manipulation of AU-rich element-controlled gene expression at the mRNA level. With a combination of single-molecule spectroscopy, computational biology, and molecular and cellular biochemistry, we show that mRNA recognition by HuR is dependent on the presentation of the sequence motif NNUUNNUUU in single-stranded conformation. The presentation of the HuR binding site in the mRNA secondary structure appears to act analogously to a regulatory on/off switch that specifically controls HuR access to mRNAs in cis. Based on this finding we present a methodology for manipulating ARE mRNA levels by actuating this conformational switch specifically in a target mRNA. Computationally designed oligonucleotides (openers) enhance the NNUUNNUUU accessibility by rearranging the mRNA conformation. Thereby they increase in vitro and endogenous HuR-mRNA complex formation which leads to specific mRNA stabilization (as demonstrated for TNFalpha and IL-2, respectively). Induced HuR binding both inside and outside the AU-rich element promotes functional IL-2 mRNA stabilization. This opener-induced mRNA stabilization mimics the endogenous IL-2 response to CD28 stimulation in human primary T-cells. We therefore propose that controlled modulation of the AU-rich element conformation by mRNA openers or closers allows message stabilization or destabilization in cis to be specifically triggered. The described methodology might provide a means for studying distinct pathways in a complex cellular network at the node of mRNA stability control. It allows ARE gene expression to be potentially silenced or boosted. This will be of particular value for drug-target validation, allowing the diseased phenotype to ameliorate or deteriorate. Finally, the mRNA openers provide a rational starting point for target-specific mRNA stability assays to screen for low-molecular-weight compounds acting as inhibitors or activators of an mRNA structure rearrangement.	0
18291179	Outcomes and survival in surgical treatment of descending thoracic aorta with acute dissection. BACKGROUND: Thoracic aortic replacement for acute DeBakey type III aortic dissection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We report the outcomes of 76 consecutive patients who underwent surgical repair of the descending thoracic aorta or the thoracoabdominal aorta for acute dissection. METHODS: During a 16-year period (1989 to 2004), we identified 76 patients who underwent surgery for acute type III aortic dissection. The average patient age was 64.1 +/- 12.3 years (range, 36 to 84), and 55 patients (72.4%) were male. Surgical adjuncts included hypothermic circulatory arrest (8 patients), left heart bypass (15 patients), and cerebrospinal fluid drainage (5 patients). The mean aortic clamp time was 38.4 +/- 17.3 minutes. Rupture was present in 17 patients (22.4%). RESULTS: There was 1 intraoperative death. Operative mortality was 22.4% (17 patients), including 11 patients (14.5%) who died within 30 days of operation. Five patients (6.6%) had paraplegia, and 15 patients (19.7%) required hemodialysis, 7 temporarily. Cardiac complications occurred in 33 patients (43.4%), 2 patients (2.6%) were returned to the operating room for bleeding, and 10 patients (13.6%) required tracheostomy. The mean hospital stay was 26.0 +/- 29.7 days. Rupture was not associated with increased risk of postoperative complications or operative mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with emergent indications, operative intervention with open replacement of the descending thoracic aorta or thoracoabdominal aorta for acute dissection repair can be carried out with respectable mortality, morbidity, and survival rates.	0

11038254	Caspase-3 activation and inflammatory responses in rat hippocampus inoculated with a recombinant adenovirus expressing the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein. To elucidate the mechanism of neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease, we investigated the effects of overexpression of wild-type Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) on neuronal cells and glial cells in vivo. When an APP695-expressing adenovirus was injected into the dorsal hippocampal region, a number of neurons in remote areas were positively stained with anti-APP monoclonal antibody, and underwent severe degeneration from 3 to 7 days after viral inoculation. Most degenerating neurons were immunopositive with both APP and activated caspase-3, but some neurons that expressed activated caspase-3 were not expressing APP from 7 to 14 days after virus injection. In the neighborhood of the degenerating neurons, activated microglia/macrophages, which were identified by the phenotypic marker C3bi receptor (CD11b/c; OX-42), were observed, and some of them appeared to phagocytose the caspase-3-immunopositive degenerating neurons. In addition to microglia/macrophages, infiltrating leukocytes expressing CD45 or CD4 were also detected. These results suggest that the increased accumulation of APP induced not only caspase-3-mediated death machinery, but also inflammatory responses including microglial activation. These inflammatory responses might cause further neurodegeneration through the alternative pathway that might activate the caspase-3-mediated death machinery without APP expression.	0

7691719	Fibrillin binds calcium and is coded by cDNAs that reveal a multidomain structure and alternatively spliced exons at the 5' end. Fibrillin is an important structural protein of the extracellular matrix. It is a large cysteine-rich glycoprotein with extensive intrachain disulfide bonds, likely contributed by multiple EGF-like repeats. We have previously published 6.9 kb of FBN1 cDNA sequence. FBN1 cDNA clones that extend the sequence 3089 bp in the 5' direction are described in this report. The deduced primary structure suggests that fibrillin is composed of multiple domains. The most predominant feature is the presence of 43 calcium binding EGF-like repeats. We demonstrate here that fibrillin molecules bind calcium. In addition, three alternatively spliced exons at the 5' end are described. Analysis of 5.8 kb of surrounding genomic sequence revealed a 1.8-kb CpG island spanning the alternatively spliced exons and the next downstream exon. Since FBN1 is the gene responsible for Marfan syndrome, the information presented here will be useful in identifying new mutations and in understanding the function of fibrillin in the pathogenesis of the disease.	0

7806931	[The collateral ligaments of the elbow joint: their functional anatomy with special reference to the pathology and treatment of post-traumatic stiff elbow]. Factors which cause stiff elbow were investigated both experimentally and clinically. Since a thickened and shortened medial collateral ligament is often seen in stiff elbow, then changes in the length of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and in the length of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) were investigated in cadaver elbow specimens, and correlated with the observed range of motion. The MCL was divided into five bundles, and the LCL into three bundles. The length changes during flexion and extension of the elbow joint were measured, and the length change pattern was found to be different from bundle to bundle. The lengths of the LCL and the anterior oblique ligament (AOL) of the MCL changed little during elbow flexion. On the other hand, the length of the posterior oblique ligament (POL) of the MCL considerably increased when the elbow joint was flexed. The more posterior the bundle was, the larger the change in length that was observed. Because the origin of the POL is far distant from the axis of motion, it was suspected that a shortening in the POL was one of the most important pathologic changes in stiff elbow. The results of the biomechanic study were applied to a subsequent clinical study. Scar formation or ectopic ossification on the medial and/or posterior parts of the elbow joint was observed in 38 of 43 cases at surgery. These pathologic regions were resected, including the scarred POL. The intra-operative findings revealed that the major restraints in stiff elbow were the medial and/or posterior parts of the elbow. The importance of the shortened POL in the clinical pathology of stiff elbow was clearly demonstrated.	0

23220072	Identification of avian RIG-I responsive genes during influenza infection. Ducks can survive infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that are lethal to chickens. We showed that the influenza detector, RIG-I can initiate antiviral responses in ducks, but this gene is absent in chickens. We can reconstitute this pathway by transfecting chicken DF-1 embryonic fibroblast cells with duck RIG-I, which augments their antiviral response to influenza and decreases viral titer. However, the genes downstream of duck RIG-I that mediate this antiviral response to influenza are not known. Using microarrays, we compared the transcriptional profile of chicken embryonic fibroblasts transfected with duck RIG-I or empty vector, and infected with low or highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Transfected duck RIG-I expressed in chicken cells was associated with the marked induction of many antiviral innate immune genes upon infection with both viruses. We used real-time PCR to confirm upregulation of a subset of these antiviral genes including MX1, PKR, IFIT5, OASL, IFNB, and downregulation of the influenza matrix gene. These results provide some insight into the genes induced by duck RIG-I upon influenza infection, and provide evidence that duck RIG-I can function to elicit an interferon-driven, antiviral response against influenza in chicken embryonic fibroblasts.	0

23245275	Arterial spin labelling perfusion MRI of breast cancer using FAIR TrueFISP: initial results. AIM: To assess the feasibility of an unenhanced, flow-sensitive, alternating inversion recovery-balanced steady-state free precession (FAIR TrueFISP) arterial spin labelling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for quantification of breast cancer perfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen untreated breast tumour patients (mean age 53    17 years, range 30-68 years) and four healthy controls (mean age 51    14 years, range 33-68 years) were enrolled in this study and were imaged using a clinical 1.5 T MRI machine. Perfusion measurements were performed using a coronal single-section ASL FAIR TrueFISP technique in addition to a routine breast MRI examination. T1 relaxation time of normal breast parenchyma was determined in four healthy volunteers using the variable flip angle approach. The definitive diagnosis was obtained at histology after biopsy or surgery and was available for all patients. RESULTS: ASL perfusion was successfully acquired in 13 of 18 tumour patients and in all healthy controls. The mean ASL perfusion of invasive ductal carcinoma tissue was significantly higher (88.2    39.5 ml/100 g/min) compared to ASL perfusion of normal breast parenchyma (24.9    12.7 ml/100 g/min; p < 0.05) and invasive lobular carcinoma (30.5    4.3 ml/100 g/min; p < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the mean ASL perfusion of normal breast parenchyma and invasive lobular carcinoma tissue (p = 0.97). CONCLUSION: ASL MRI enables quantification of breast cancer perfusion without the use of contrast material. However, its impact on diagnosis and therapy management of breast tumours has to be evaluated in larger patient studies.	0

24345185	ENV7 and YCK3, which encode vacuolar membrane protein kinases, genetically interact to impact cell fitness and vacuole morphology. Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuoles serve as a model for membrane fusion and fission. Yck3, a vacuolar membrane kinase, has been implicated in regulation of vacuole fusion. Recently, we established Env7 as another vacuolar membrane protein kinase with similar but nonredundant function to Yck3. Here, we report that native Env7 localizes to the vacuole independent of Yck3, where as its phosphorylation is YCK3 dependent. We also show that env7/\\yck3/\\ double mutant exhibits severely compromised fitness, altered cell size and bud vacuoles, and F-class vacuolar morphology. Our results establish negative genetic interactions between ENV7 and YCK3 and suggest cooperative roles for the two conserved genes in regulation of membrane dynamics. Such genetic buffering supports a critical role for membrane flux in global cell fitness.	0
17684518	Increases in cerebrospinal fluid caffeine concentration are associated with favorable outcome after severe traumatic brain injury in humans. Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive drug and a weak adenosine receptor antagonist, can be neuroprotective or neurotoxic depending on the experimental model or neurologic disorder. However, its contribution to pathophysiology and outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans is undefined. We assessed serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of caffeine and its metabolites (theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline) by high-pressure liquid chromatography/ultraviolet in 97 ventricular CSF samples from an established bank, from 30 adults with severe TBI. We prospectively selected a threshold caffeine level of > or = 1 micromol/L (194 ng/mL) as clinically significant. Demographics, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, admission blood alcohol level, and 6-month dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score were assessed. Mean time from injury to initial CSF sampling was 10.77+/-3.13 h. On initial sampling, caffeine was detected in 24 of 30 patients, and the threshold was achieved in 9 patients. Favorable GOS was seen more often in patients with CSF caffeine concentration > or = versus < the threshold (55.6 versus 11.8%, P=0.028). Gender, age, admission CGS score, admission blood alcohol level, and admission systolic arterial blood pressure did not differ between patients with CSF caffeine concentration > or = versus < the threshold. Increases in CSF concentrations of the caffeine metabolites theobromine and paraxanthine were also associated with favorable outcome (P=0.018 and 0.056, respectively). Caffeine and its metabolites are commonly detected in CSF in patients with severe TBI and in an exploratory assessment are associated with favorable outcome. We speculate that caffeine may be neuroprotective by long-term upregulation of adenosine A1 receptors or acute inhibition of A2a receptors.	0
6746625	A 1H NMR comparison of the met-cyano complexes of elephant and sperm whale myoglobin. Assignment of labile proton resonances in the heme cavity and determination of the distal glutamine orientation from relaxation data. The met-cyano complex of elephant myoglobin has been investigated by high field 1H NMR spectroscopy, with special emphasis on the use of exchangeable proton resonances in the heme cavity to obtain structural information on the distal glutamine. Analysis of the distance dependence of relaxation rates and the exchange behavior of the four hyperfine shifted labile proton resonances has led to the assignment of the proximal His-F8 ring and peptide NHs and the His-FG3 ring NH and the distal Gln-E7 amide NH. The similar hyperfine shift patterns for both the apparent heme resonances as well as the labile proton peaks of conserved resonances in elephant and sperm whale met-cyano myoglobins support very similar electronic/molecular structures for their heme cavities. The essentially identical dipolar shifts and dipolar relaxation times for the distal Gln-E7 side chain NH and the distal His-E7 ring NH in sperm whale myoglobin indicate that those labile protons occupy the same geometrical position relative to the iron and heme plane. This geometry is consistent with the distal residue hydrogen bonding to the coordinated ligand. The similar rates and identical mechanisms of exchange with bulk water of the labile protons for the three conserved residues in the elephant and sperm whale heme cavity indicate that the dynamic stability of the proximal side of the heme pocket is unaltered upon the substitution (His----Gln). The much slower exchange rate (by greater than 10(4] of the distal NH in elephant relative to sperm whale myoglobin supports the assignment of the resonance to the intrinsically less labile amide side chain.	0
15077858	The discovery of retrolental fibroplasia and the role of oxygen: a historical review, 1942-1956. Nearly 50 years after it was thought to be conquered, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continues to cause vision disturbances and blindness among prematurely born infants. During the 1940s and early 1950s, researchers and caregivers first identified and struggled to eliminate this problem, which seemed to come from nowhere and was concentrated among the most advanced premature nurseries in the U.S. Research studies initially identified many potential causes, none of which could be proved conclusively. By the mid 1950s, oxygen was identified as the culprit, and its use was immediately restricted. The rate of blindness among premature infants decreased significantly. ROP was not cured, however. By the 1960s, it had reappeared. The history of ROP serves to remind us that, despite our best intentions, the care and treatment of premature newborns will always carry with it the possibility of iatrogenic disease. This caution is worth remembering as we work to expand the quality and quantity of clinical research.	0
17995950	Arcyptera fusca and Arcyptera tornosi repetitive DNA families: whole-comparative genomic hybridization (W-CGH) as a novel approach to the study of satellite DNA libraries. Whole-comparative genomic hybridization (W-CGH) has been used to exemplify a simple methodology which allows identifying and mapping whole genome differences for highly repetitive DNA sequences between two related species of unknown genomic background. The use of this technique to the species binomy Arcyptera fusca/Arcyptera tornosi has allowed the identification of different DNA families mainly concentrated within the para-/peri-centromeric and distal heterochromatic regions of different chromosomes, which are differentially expanded in both genomes. Additionally, W-CGH allowed chromosome mapping of particular euchromatic regions immersed in the chromosome arms which have been affected by processes of DNA amplification and losses. A molecular approach was also conducted to analyse satellite DNA families in these species. We have found three different families showing an unequal representation in both species. Two of these families showed a centromeric location (EcoRV-390CEN and Sau3A-419CEN), whereas the last one was located at distal heterochromatic regions (Sau3A-197TEL). As A. fusca is a widely distributed species represented in most European high mountains, whereas A. tornosi is an endemic species represented in the Iberian Peninsula, the differences and resemblances reported here offer a good basis to support a close evolutionary relationship between both of the actually isolated species. Finally, W-CGH allowed identification of an asynchronic pattern of heterochromatin condensation through early prophase (characteristic in both species) which is uncommon or probably has been poorly analysed within classical early condensing chromosome domains through meiosis. The congruence of the obtained cytological and molecular results is analysed in light of the ancestral genome relationship between both species.	0

18456796	Animal models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mechanisms involved in the genesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly defined. This area is complicated and difficult to model because COPD consists of four separate anatomic lesions (emphysema, small airway remodeling, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic bronchitis) and a functional lesion, acute exacerbation; moreover, the disease in humans develops over decades. This review discusses the various animal models that have been used to attempt to recreate human COPD and the advantages and disadvantages of each. None of the models reproduces the exact changes seen in humans, but cigarette smoke-induced disease appears to come the closest, and genetically modified animals also, in some instances, shed light on processes that appear to play a role.	0
10474797	[Low-threshold potential-controlled calcium channels--their properties and functions]. Low voltage-activated calcium channels discovered 15 year ago are unique molecular structures which play a specific role in the functioning of different types of excitable cells. This conclusion is supported by recent identification of special channel-forming 1- subunits which after expression in artificial cellular systems generate transmembrane currents characteristic for low-voltage-activated calcium channels. At the same time, analysis of recent experimental data indicate the existence of several subtypes of low voltage-activated channels which differ in the characteristics of their permeability, kinetics and pharmacological sensitivity. The expression of different subtypes of low-voltage activated channels is found to be highly coordinated, on one hand, with different phases of the ontogenetic development of excitable cells and, on the other, with their fulfillment of specific functions. Therefore the search for selective modulators of the activity of these channels is an extremely important goal for modern investigations.	0

Three large-scale protein interaction studies, including one by Couzens et al. in this week's issue, have dramatically increased the scope of information about Hippo pathways. In addition to adding nuance to mechanistic interactions that were already known or suspected, these works implicate membrane trafficking, activity of the phosphatase PP6, and cytokinetic regulation in Hippo signaling. A mechanism of pathway inhibition involving the endosomal-lysosomal axis emerges, and dramatic remodeling of protein interactions upon phosphatase inhibition is revealed. Overall, these studies provide a rich new resource for the expanded study of this highly conserved pathway.	0
15783528	Short-range spectroscopic ruler based on a single-molecule optical switch. We demonstrate a novel all-optical switch consisting of two molecules: a primary fluorophore (Cy5) that can be switched between a fluorescent and a dark state by light of different wavelengths, and a secondary chromophore (Cy3) that facilitates switching. The interaction between the two molecules exhibits a distance dependence much steeper than that of conventional Fo rster resonance energy transfer. This enables the switch to act as a ruler with the capability to probe distances difficult to access by other spectroscopic methods, thus presenting a new tool for the study of biomolecules at the single-molecule level.	0

15986949	Hybrid layer thickness and morphology: the influence of cavity preparation with Er:YAG laser. Dentinal surfaces prepared with Er:YAG laser have significantly different characteristics from those prepared with conventional instruments. Different hybrid layer morphologies and thicknesses occur, which may result in differences in the quality of restorations placed on dentinal surfaces prepared with a diamond bur when compared with using an Er:YAG Laser. This study compared the hybrid layer thickness and morphology formed utilizing Scotchbond Multipurpose Plus (SBMP) on dentin prepared with a diamond bur in a high speed handpiece and dentin prepared with an Er:YAG laser. Flat dentin surfaces obtained from five human teeth were treated with the two methods and then with the dentin adhesive system according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a layer of composite was applied, the specimens were sectioned, flattened, polished and prepared for SEM observation. Ten different measurements of hybrid layer thickness were obtained along the bonded surface in each specimen. Results showed that SBMP produced a 3.43 +/- 0.75 microm hybrid layer in dentin prepared with a diamond bur. This hybrid layer was regular and constantly found. In the laser group, the dentin adhesive system produced a 1.54 +/- 0.35 microm hybrid layer that was very irregular and not found constantly. Statistical analysis of variance (p < 0.05) showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the groups. These data indicate that the Er:YAG laser, with parameters used in the experiment, is not a preparation method that allows for a thick hybrid layer formation, which is in opposition to using a diamond bur in a high speed turbine.	0

22334383	Autophagy in toxicology: self-consumption in times of stress and plenty. Autophagy is a critical cellular process orchestrating the lysosomal degradation of cellular components in order to maintain cellular homeostasis and respond to cellular stress. A growing research effort over the last decade has proven autophagy to be essential for constitutive protein and organelle turnover, for embryonic/neonatal survival and for cell survival during conditions of environmental stress. Emphasizing its biological importance, dysfunctional autophagy contributes to a diverse set of human diseases. Cellular stress induced by xenobiotic exposure typifies environmental stress, and can result in the induction of autophagy as a cytoprotective mechanism. An increasing number of xenobiotics are notable for their ability to modulate the induction or the rate of autophagy. The role of autophagy in normal cellular homeostasis, the intricate relationship between cellular stress and the induction of autophagy, and the identification of specific xenobiotics capable of modulating autophagy, point to the importance of the autophagic process in toxicology. This review will summarize the importance of autophagy and its role in cellular response to stress, including examples in which consideration of autophagy has contributed to a more complete understanding of toxicant-perturbed systems.	0
12538914	Alpha-helically constrained phage display library. The library described here is a collection of phages with six degenerate codons in gene VIII, specifying amino acids 12, 13, 15-17 and 19 of the major coat protein. The randomized positions are surface exposed in the wild-type protein and thus might be expected to tolerate a great diversity of side chains without compromising phage viability. In agreement with this supposition, the new library showed great diversity of amino acids at the randomized positions and diversity did not diminish noticeably during repeated subculture. Despite their diversity, however, the randomized positions should be strongly constrained conformationally because they lie in an extended alpha-helical portion of the protein, stabilized by numerous inter- and intra-subunit contacts--a presupposition corroborated by circular dichroism spectroscopy of many library members. To reflect this conformational homogeneity and the fact that random amino acids subtend a major fraction of the surface 'landscape' of the particle, we call the new construct an alpha landscape library. It can be used as a source of alpha-helical ligands and substitute antibodies.	0

24370387	Effects of environment on the release of Ni, Cr, Fe, and Co from new and recast Ni-Cr alloy. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The addition of previously cast alloy to new alloy for economic reasons may increase the release of elements. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of the immersion period, immersion media, and addition of previously cast alloy to new alloy on the release of elements. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Disk-shaped specimens were prepared from a Ni-Cr alloy (Ni: 61 wt%, Cr: 26 wt%, Mo: 11 wt%, Si: 1.5 wt%, Fe, Ce, Al, and Co <1 wt%) (Remanium CS; Dentaurum) with new alloy (group N) and 50% new/50% recast alloy (group R). After the immersion of the specimens in both NaCl (pH 4) and artificial saliva (pH 6.7) for 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days, the release of ions was determined by using atomic absorption spectrometry. Data were analyzed with a 3-way ANOVA (a=.001). RESULTS: The release of Ni was significantly affected by the immersion period, of Ni and Cr by the alloy and media (P<.01), and of Fe by the alloy (P<.01). Ion release from the recast alloy in artificial saliva was 109.71 for Ni, 6.49 for Cr, 223.22 for Fe, and 29.90  g/L for Co. The release of Co in NaCl was below the detection limit in both groups. CONCLUSION: The release of Ni in NaCl and artificial saliva increased with the length of the immersion period in both groups. The release of Cr and Fe was higher in artificial saliva than in NaCl in group R, regardless of the immersion period. The release of Co in NaCl was below the detection limit in both groups.	0

10777590	FHX, a novel fork head factor with a dual DNA binding specificity. The HNF3/fork head family includes a large number of transcription factors that share a structurally related DNA binding domain. Fork head factors have been shown to play important roles both during development and in the adult. We now describe the cloning of a novel mammalian fork head factor that we have named FHX (fork head homologous X (FHX), which is expressed in many adult tissues. In the embryo, FHX expression showed a very early onset during the cleavage stages of preimplantation development. Polymerase chain reaction-assisted site selection experiments showed that FHX bound DNA with a dual sequence specificity. Sites recognized by FHX could be classified into two different types according to their sequences. Binding of FHX to sequences of each type appeared to occur independently. Our data suggest that either different regions of the fork head domain or different molecular forms of this domain could be involved in binding of FHX to each type of site. In transfection assays, FHX was capable of activating transcription from promoters containing FHX sites of either type.	0
24377588	Risk of treatment-related mortality with sorafenib in patients with cancer. BACKGROUND: Fatal adverse events (FAEs) have been reported with sorafenib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor (VEGFR TKI). We here performed an up-to-date and detailed meta-analysis to determine the overall risk of FAEs associated with sorafenib. METHODS: Databases, including PubMed, Embase and Web of Science, and abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings were searched to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials evaluating sorafenib effects in patients with all malignancies. Summary incidence rates, relative risks (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for FAEs. In addition, subgroup analyses were performed according to tumor type and therapy regimen. RESULTS: 13 trials recruiting 5,546 patients were included in our analysis. The overall incidence of FAEs with sorafenib was 1.99% (95%CI, 0.98-4.02%). Patients treated with sorafenib had a significantly increased risk of FAEs compared with patients treated with control medication, with an RR of 1.77 (95%CI 1.25-2.52, P=0.001). Risk varied with tumour type, but appeared independent of therapy regimen. A significantly increased risk of FAEs was observed in patients with lung cancer (RR 2.26; 95% CI 1.03-4.99; P= 0.043) and renal cancer (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.15-2.94; P= 0.011). The most common causes of FAEs were hemorrhage (8.6%) and thrombus or embolism (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: It is important for health care practitioners to be aware of the risks of FAEs associated with sorafenib, especially in patients with renal and lung cancer.	0

15974347	Effects of choice on performance in two cultures. Research in Japan and the United States has demonstrated that learning and memory may be improved when individuals are permitted to choose materials to be learned. In Japanese studies, the effects appear to be limited to the specific materials actually chosen, whereas in the United States, choice enhances recall of chosen as well as other materials that are later assigned. In the United States, personal choice has been hypothesized to affect both the learner's relationship to the chosen materials as well as motivation; in Japan personal choice affects the relationship between the learner and the chosen materials. Apparently the consequences of choice may vary in these cultures.	0
17868137	A modified model of hindlimb osteomyocutaneous flap for the study of tolerance to composite tissue allografts. Composite tissue allotransplantation (CTA) is the new frontier in transplantation. More than 25 hand allograft transplants have been performed worldwide, and the feasibility has been well established. The classical experimental model of CTA involves rat orthotopic hindlimb transplantation, a time-consuming procedure associated with high mortality and morbidity. We describe a rat heterotopic osteomyocutaneous flap that serves as a nonfunctional CTA, allowing the study of tolerance induction to a highly antigenic vascularized allograft of bone, muscle, and skin while minimizing the morbidity and mortality of full hind limb transplantation. In the present studies, we explored whether establishing chimerism by nonmyeloablative conditioning would induce tolerance to CTA. When compared with the classic hind limb transplantation model, these results demonstrate that our heterotopic hind limb flap is less morbid and as an effective experimental model for the study of CTA tolerance.	0
23628713	Sad facial cues inhibit temporal attention: evidence from an event-related potential study. We examined the influence of different emotional cues (happy or sad) on temporal attention (short or long interval) using behavioral as well as event-related potential recordings during a Stroop task. Emotional stimuli cued short and long time intervals, inducing 'sad-short', 'sad-long', 'happy-short', and 'happy-long' conditions. Following the intervals, participants performed a numeric Stroop task. Behavioral results showed the temporal attention effects in the sad-long, happy-long, and happy-short conditions, in which valid cues quickened the reaction times, but not in the sad-short condition. N2 event-related potential components showed sad cues to have decreased activity for short intervals compared with long intervals, whereas happy cues did not. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for different modulation of sad and happy facial cues on temporal attention. Furthermore, sad cues inhibit temporal attention, resulting in longer reaction time and decreased neural activity in the short interval by diverting more attentional resources.	0

22629613	The hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of textile preparation auxiliaries on the photochemical treatment of nonylphenol ethoxylate. The present paper deals with the effects of frequently used textile preparation chemicals and common ions on the H2O2/UV-C treatment of a commercially important and slowly biodegradable nonionic surfactant, namely a nonylphenol bearing 10 ethoxylated chains. For this purpose, the effect of soda ash carbonate (0-5.0 g L(-1)), two phosphonic acid-based organic sequestering agents (0-2.5 g L(-1)) and chloride (0-3.0 g L(-1)) at two different pH values (3.5 and 10.5) as hydroxyl radical scavengers was experimentally investigated. Among the studied textile preparation chemicals and hydroxyl radical scavengers, the decreasing order of hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity was established as diethylene triamine pentamethylene phosphonic acid > 1-hydroxy ethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid > soda ash carbonate at pH 10.5 > chloride at pH 3.5 > chloride at pH 10.5.	0
21524302	Simrank: Rapid and sensitive general-purpose k-mer search tool. BACKGROUND: Terabyte-scale collections of string-encoded data are expected from consortia efforts such as the Human Microbiome Project http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/hmp. Intra- and inter-project data similarity searches are enabled by rapid k-mer matching strategies. Software applications for sequence database partitioning, guide tree estimation, molecular classification and alignment acceleration have benefited from embedded k-mer searches as sub-routines. However, a rapid, general-purpose, open-source, flexible, stand-alone k-mer tool has not been available. RESULTS: Here we present a stand-alone utility, Simrank, which allows users to rapidly identify database strings the most similar to query strings. Performance testing of Simrank and related tools against DNA, RNA, protein and human-languages found Simrank 10X to 928X faster depending on the dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Simrank provides molecular ecologists with a high-throughput, open source choice for comparing large sequence sets to find similarity.	0

20942844	Identification of a potent anti-IL-15 antibody with opposing mechanisms of action in vitro and in vivo. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is important in the activation and proliferation of lymphocytic cell populations and is implicated in inflammatory disease. We report the characterization of a novel monoclonal antibody DISC0280 which is specific for human IL-15. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: DISC0280 was characterized in a direct binding assay of IL-15 with IL-15 receptor a (IL-15Ra) and by its ability to alter IL-15 mediated proliferation of a range of cell lines (cytotoxic T lymphocyte line-2, M-07e, KIT225). A pharmacodynamic model injecting male C57/BL6 mice with IL-15 or IL-15/IL-15Ra, with or without DISC0280, and assessing changes in lymphocytic cell populations and serum cytokines was utilized. KEY RESULTS: DISC0280 inhibited the binding of IL-15 to IL-15Ra and also potently inhibits IL-15 dependent proliferation of cells expressing IL-15Ra, shared interleukin 2/ interleukin 15 receptor b chain (IL-15Rb) and common gamma chain (y(c) ). DISC0280 also inhibited the IL-15 dependent proliferation of M-07e cells that only express IL-15Rb/y(c) subunits. Human IL-15 injected into mice caused an increase in NK1.1(+) and CD3(+) cells in the spleen and peripheral blood and these effects were unexpectedly potentiated by giving DISC0280 with human IL-15. This increase in cells caused by DISC0280/IL-15 co-administration was greater than that observed when IL-15 was administered complexed with soluble IL-15Ra. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The ability of DISC0280 to bind to the IL-15Ra-binding site on IL-15 allows trans-presentation of IL-15 by DISC0280 in vivo, similar to the trans-presentation by soluble IL-15Ra. DISC0280 may be therefore suitable as a clinical substitute for IL-15.	0
24013951	Effect of catenation and basicity of pillared ligands on the water stability of MOFs. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have extremely high surface areas and pore volumes, tunable pore sizes and chemical functionalities and are an interesting addition to the field of porous materials. One of the key challenges that needs to be overcome to elevate MOFs to the applied level is their sensitivity to humid environments. The work reported here seeks to address this critical issue by examining two important contributors to MOF stability or instability: basicity (pKa value) of the pillar ligand and catenation of the framework. Catenation is the interpenetration or interweaving of two or more identical and independent frameworks. We demonstrate that, using catenation in combination with a pillaring strategy, it is possible to obtain water stable MOFs even when the pillar ligand has lower basicity (pKa value). This study shows that after 90% relative humidity (RH) exposure, comparing Zn-BDC-DABCO (DMOF) and Zn-BDC-BPY (MOF-508), MOF-508 is stable due to its two-fold interpenetration that prevents significant water adsorption. In contrast, comparing non-catenated isostructural pillared MOFs Zn-TMBDC-DABCO (DMOF-TM) and Zn-TMBDC-BPY (MOF-508-TM), MOF-508-TM is unstable since BPY is less basic (higher pKa) and less rigid than DABCO.	0
21383888	Structure, function, and pharmacology of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs): focus on ASIC1a. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are H(+)-gated Na(+) channels, which are present in most, if not all, neurons. The typical ASIC current is transient and is elicited by a rapid drop in the extracellular pH. In the human genome, four genes for ASICs are present: asic1 - 4. In this review, we will focus on ASIC1a, one of the key subunits in the central nervous system. We will describe the structure of this channel, a topic that has enormously profited from the recent elucidation of the first crystal structure of an ASIC. We will then relate the ASIC1 structure to current models of the gating mechanism of ASICs. Finally, we will review the pharmacology of ASIC1a. Advances in the pharmacological inhibition of individual ASIC currents have greatly contributed to our current knowledge of the functional roles of this channel in physiology, including learning, memory, and fear conditioning, and in pathophysiological states, including the neurodegeneration accompanying stroke, and axonal degeneration in autoimmune inflammation.	0
8262376	Differential transcription of multiple copies of a silk worm gene encoding tRNA(Gly1). Ten different tRNA(Gly1) genes from the silk worm, Bombyx mori, have been cloned and characterized. These genes were transcribed in vitro in homologous nuclear extracts from the posterior silk gland (PSG) or nuclear extracts derived from the middle silk gland or ovarian tissues. Although the transcription levels were much higher in the PSG nuclear extracts, the transcriptional efficiency of the individual genes followed a similar pattern in all the extracts. Based on the levels of in vitro transcription, the ten tRNA(Gly1) genes could be divided into three groups, viz., those which were transcribed at very high levels (e.g., clone pR8), high to medium levels (e.g., pBmi1, pBmp1, pBmh1, pBmt1) and low to barely detectable levels (e.g., pBms1, pBmj1 and pBmk1). The coding sequences of all these tRNA genes being identical, the differential transcription suggested that the flanking sequences modulate their transcriptional efficiency. The presence of positive and negative regulatory elements in the 5' flanking regions of these genes was confirmed by transcription competition experiments. A positive element was present in the immediate upstream A+T-rich sequences in all the genes, but no consensus sequences correlating to the transcriptional status could be generated. The presence of negative elements on the other hand was indicated only in some of the genes and therefore may have a role in the differential transcription of these tRNA(Gly1) genes in vivo.	0

7526103	Colorectal cancer prognosis and expression of exon-v6-containing CD44 proteins. CD44 variants containing v6 confer metastatic potential to rat carcinoma cell-lines. In man, CD44v6 is increasingly expressed during colorectal tumour progression. In 68 colorectal carcinoma patients, survival analysis showed that CD44v6 expression in the tumours was associated with tumour-related death. In patients who had an apparently radical resection of their primary tumour, CD44v6 expression had prognostic value independent of Dukes' stage. CD44v6 expression may reflect propensity for metastasis after apparently curative surgery, making adjuvant therapy an option in these patients.	0
16539604	Patterns of asymmetry in the twining vine Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae): ontogenetic and hierarchical perspectives. We studied patterns of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in leaves of four populations of the neotropical vine Dalechampia scandens to obtain insight into the origin of leaf FA and the level at which it is controlled. We analysed correlations in signed and unsigned asymmetry at different organizational levels. We also analysed the ontogeny of FA during leaf expansion to test whether asymmetry is regulated during cell expansion, and whether fast-expanding leaves are more or less asymmetrical. Signed asymmetry was negatively correlated between successive leaves, that is, when the right side of a leaf was larger than the left side, the next leaf on the shoot tended to show the opposite pattern. The magnitude of FA, however, was very weakly correlated among successive leaves or among leaves measured on different shoots. The direction of asymmetry did not change during leaf expansion, but the relative asymmetry, that is, asymmetry corrected for difference in trait size, decreased during expansion. We found a weak negative relationship between leaf expansion rate and relative asymmetry on the fully expanded leaves. These results suggest that leaf asymmetry in Dalechampia originates from perturbations in cell proliferation in the stem, creating asymmetries in opposite directions in successive leaves. These asymmetries persist during leaf expansion, but tend to be reduced by unknown mechanisms.	0

22366787	Heterozygous missense mutations in SMARCA2 cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NBS) is characterized by sparse hair, distinctive facial morphology, distal-limb anomalies and intellectual disability. We sequenced the exomes of ten individuals with NBS and identified heterozygous variants in SMARCA2 in eight of them. Extended molecular screening identified nonsynonymous SMARCA2 mutations in 36 of 44 individuals with NBS; these mutations were confirmed to be de novo when parental samples were available. SMARCA2 encodes the core catalytic unit of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that is involved in the regulation of gene transcription. The mutations cluster within sequences that encode ultra-conserved motifs in the catalytic ATPase region of the protein. These alterations likely do not impair SWI/SNF complex assembly but may be associated with disrupted ATPase activity. The identification of SMARCA2 mutations in humans provides insight into the function of the Snf2 helicase family.	0
10755626	The role of fimbriae and flagella in the adherence of avian strains of Escherichia coli O78:K80 to tissue culture cells and tracheal and gut explants. To investigate the role of fimbriae and flagella in the pathogenesis of avian colibacillosis, isogenic insertionally inactivated mutant strains of Escherichia coli O78:K80 strain EC34195 defective in the elaboration of type-1 and curli fimbriae and flagella were constructed by allelic exchange. Single and multiple non-fimbriate and non-flagellate mutant strains were compared to the wild-type in vitro in adherence assays with a HEp-2 cell line, a mucus-secreting cell line HT2916E, a non-mucus-secreting cell line HT2919A, tracheal explant and proximal gut explant. Mutant strains defective in the elaboration of type-1 fimbriae were significantly less adherent--in the order of 90% reduction--than the wild-type strain in all assays. Mutant strains defective in the elaboration of flagella were generally as adherent as the wild-type strain except when assayed with the mucus-secreting cell line HT2916E, for which a significant reduction of adherence--of the order of 90%--compared with the wild-type strain was observed. Mutant strains defective for the elaboration of curli fimbriae adhered as well as the wild-type strain in all assays, except when assayed in tests with gut explant tissue for which a significant reduction of adherence--of the order of 80%--compared with the wild-type strain was observed. Adherence to explants was to epithelial, not serous, surfaces and was 10-fold greater to tracheal than to gut explants. Together, these data support the hypothesis that type-1 fimbriae are significant factors in adherence, aided by flagella for penetration of mucus and curli fimbriae for adherence to the gut.	0
9819532	Use of surrogate markers for drugs of military importance. In the future, U.S. military forces will be faced with opposing forces that have chemical and biological weapon capabilities. Although drugs used against these agents would be an ideal solution to protecting soldiers, the ability to test their efficacy in humans is limited by several ethical and technical problems: (1) the high risk of toxicity to volunteers; (2) the risk of delayed side effects in the volunteers; and (3) the inability to extrapolate effects against sublethal doses to efficacy against lethal doses. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relies on safety and efficacy data in humans, making approval for these types of drugs difficult. An alternative approach for regulatory approval would be to use surrogate markers. Surrogate markers are biochemical or physiologic measurements that demonstrate the direct effect of the drug. Surrogate markers, such as CD4 counts and viral RNA levels, have been used recently in the anti-human immunodeficiency virus drug approval process with success. A drug development program using surrogate markers must meet several criteria, including demonstrated efficacy in animal models, correlation between efficacy and the surrogate marker, a link between the surrogate marker and the pathophysiology and toxicologic effects of the agent, and the ability to produce the surrogate marker in humans. This article illustrates the use of drug-induced methemoglobin as a surrogate marker for protection against cyanide intoxication. Safety issues regarding this class of drugs would also have to be pursued aggressively during and after their use by military forces. Demonstrating that the drug satisfies these criteria would be a platform for approval by the FDA. The guidelines mentioned above should be an acceptable approach for FDA approval, scientific researchers, medical practitioners, and the soldiers using these drugs.	0
8106586	Rapid and sensitive assay of dobutamine in plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrochemical detection. A sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection was developed for measuring dobutamine in human plasma samples. Following an external standard method, 0.1 ml of EDTA-glutathione plasma was diluted on ice with 0.2 ml of a 5% trichloracetic acid solution. The mixture was centrifuged, filtered, and 30 microliters were injected. Assessment was done by electrochemical detection. The assay was linear from 1 to 400 ng/ml plasma. For determination of dobutamine we also used a liquid-liquid extraction method routinely applied for plasma catecholamines. Liquid-liquid extraction requires application of 100-1000 microliters of plasma. The standard curve was linear from 0.1 to 600 ng/ml. Absolute recovery of dobutamine was 90 +/- 3% with the liquid-liquid extraction procedure and 91 +/- 3% with the protein precipitation method. For both methods dobutamine was separated on Nova-Pak C18 columns. The mobile phase used was 0.1 molar phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (80:20, v/v) with 1-octanesulfonic acid and triethylamine as ion-pair reagents. The pH was adjusted to 2.7.	0
18923042	Shared internal models for feedforward and feedback control. A child often learns to ride a bicycle in the driveway, free of unforeseen obstacles. Yet when she first rides in the street, we hope that if a car suddenly pulls out in front of her, she will combine her innate goal of avoiding an accident with her learned knowledge of the bicycle, and steer away or brake. In general, when we train to perform a new motor task, our learning is most robust if it updates the rules of online error correction to reflect the rules and goals of the new task. Here we provide direct evidence that, after a new feedforward motor adaptation, motor feedback responses to unanticipated errors become precisely task appropriate, even when such errors were never experienced during training. To study this ability, we asked how, if at all, do online responses to occasional, unanticipated force pulses during reaching arm movements change after adapting to altered arm dynamics? Specifically, do they change in a task-appropriate manner? In our task, subjects learned novel velocity-dependent dynamics. However, occasional force-pulse perturbations produced unanticipated changes in velocity. Therefore, after adaptation, task-appropriate responses to unanticipated pulses should compensate corresponding changes in velocity-dependent dynamics. We found that after adaptation, pulse responses precisely compensated these changes, although they were never trained to do so. These results provide evidence for a smart feedback controller which automatically produces responses specific to the learned dynamics of the current task. To accomplish this, the neural processes underlying feedback control must (1) be capable of accurate real-time state prediction for velocity via a forward model and (2) have access to recently learned changes in internal models of limb dynamics.	0
8224854	In search of new mutants in cell-signaling systems of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Review. Development of multicellular organisms is controlled mainly by cell-signaling systems. In this review I first discuss methods of genetic analysis and properties of mutants of cell-signaling systems in general and in the nematode C. elegans. Then, I describe two of our approaches to isolating new mutants in cell-signaling of C. elegans. The first approach is to select for mutants that have the same visible phenotype as those in known cell-signaling genes. In a survey of larval lethal mutations we found that there are quite a few mutants in which the inner surface of the body wall is detached from the outer surface of the intestine. Some of them map in genes that are known to act in cell-signaling systems in vulval induction or sex myoblast migration, which are not essential to the growth and survival of C. elegans. Therefore, we think many of the mutations of the above phenotype disrupt cell-signaling in an unidentified essential function, and also cell-signaling in the non-essential functions. The second approach is to isolate mutants resistant to a drug expected to disturb cell-signaling. As the drug we have chosen sodium fluoride, which depletes calcium ion, activates G-proteins and inactivates some phosphatases. The mutants are grouped into two classes (three and two genes, respectively) according to degree of fluoride-resistance and growth rate of larvae. Although there is so far no direct evidence that these mutants are related to cell-signaling, they show complex epistasis that can be explained by a model consisting of a cell-signaling pathway.	0

Methane formation in methanogenic Archaea is catalyzed by methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) and takes place via the reduction of methyl-coenzyme M (CH3-S-CoM) with coenzyme B (HS-CoB) to methane and the heterodisulfide CoM-S-S-CoB. MCR harbors the nickel porphyrinoid coenzyme F430 as a prosthetic group, which has to be in the Ni(I) oxidation state for the enzyme to be active. To date no intermediates in the catalytic cycle of MCRred1 (red for reduced Ni) have been identified. Here, we report a detailed characterization of MCRred1m (\"m\" for methyl-coenzyme M), which is the complex of MCRred1a (\"a\" for absence of substrate) with CH3-S-CoM. Using continuous-wave and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with selective isotope labeling (13C and 2H) of CH3-S-CoM, it is shown that CH3-S-CoM binds in the active site of MCR such that its thioether sulfur is weakly coordinated to the Ni(I) of F430. The complex is stable until the addition of the second substrate, HS-CoB. Results from EPR spectroscopy, along with quantum mechanical calculations, are used to characterize the electronic and geometric structure of this complex, which can be regarded as the first intermediate in the catalytic mechanism.	0
11457696	Radiofrequency resurfacing: technique and clinical review. Radiofrequency resurfacing has recently emerged as a new modality for treating facial wrinkles. This approach uses a novel method of energy-mediated, \"cool\" cellular disintegration that is distinct from the tissue effects associated with heat-based lasers. Early clinical findings have shown that radio-frequency resurfacing results in significant improvement in wrinkles and overall cosmetic appearance. The technique is also assocaited with rapid healing, minimal pain, and a low incidence of adverse events. If initial clinical experience is confirmed in broader use, radiofrequency resurfacing could help expand the number of resurfacing procedures performed and could extend treatment to new and perhaps younger patients.	0

21551305	Complete genome sequence of Metallosphaera cuprina, a metal sulfide-oxidizing archaeon from a hot spring. The genome of the metal sulfide-oxidizing, thermoacidophilic strain Metallosphaera cuprina Ar-4 has been completely sequenced and annotated. Originally isolated from a sulfuric hot spring, strain Ar-4 grows optimally at 65  C and a pH of 3.5. The M. cuprina genome has a 1,840,348-bp circular chromosome (2,029 open reading frames [ORFs]) and is 16% smaller than the previously sequenced Metallosphaera sedula genome. Compared to the M. sedula genome, there are no counterpart genes in the M. cuprina genome for about 480 ORFs in the M. sedula genome, of which 243 ORFs are annotated as hypothetical protein genes. Still, there are 233 ORFs uniquely occurring in M. cuprina. Genome annotation supports that M. cuprina lives a facultative life on CO(2) and organics and obtains energy from oxidation of sulfidic ores and reduced inorganic sulfuric compounds.	0

10779028	Imparied platelet--dense granule release in neonates. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to examine differences in platelet dense granule (PDG) uptake and release between preterm infants, term infants, and adults. METHODS: PDG uptake and release was examined by flow cytometry using mepacrine fluorescent staining in phycoerythrin-anti-GPIIb/IIIa bound platelets taken from cord blood of eight term infants and seven preterm infants and venous blood from eight adults. RESULTS: Analysis of the baseline fluorescence in the untreated versus thrombin-treated samples revealed significant differences in the way infant PDGs responded to thrombin stimulation when compared with adults. Initial uptake of mepacrine in both term and preterm platelets was similar to that in adult platelets. Statistically significant differences between adults and both term and preterm infants, at two concentrations of mepacrine, were observed after stimulation with thrombin. CONCLUSION: Persistent mepacrine staining of infant PDGs, when compared with those of adults, after thrombin stimulation implies defective infant PDG release. This may partially explain why infants have impaired response to agonists requiring ATP release from PDGs.	0
8089559	[Evaluation of immunochromatography assay technique for detection of hepatitis B surface antigen]. A new immunochromatography assay technique (DAINASCREEN HBsAg, Dainabot) has been recently introduced for the detection of the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). To evaluate the feasibility of using the DAINASCREEN HBsAg, we carried out comparison tests with this method and RPHA. Results obtained were as follows: In a test of 692 sera from inhabitants in Iki island, Nagasaki Prefecture, 24 (3.5%) were positive for HBsAg by both DAINA and RPHA. Twenty-four patients with hepatitis B were all positive in both methods. Thirty patients with autoimmune diseases and eight who had accidental needle exposure to the blood of patients with HBV infection were negative by both methods. Six individuals were followed over a period of 10 years and all eventually eliminated HBsAg from their sera. In four patients, HBsAg remained positive by DAINA at one yearly check after it had become negative by RPHA. In five patients, HBsAg remained positive by RIA and IMs after DAINA and RPHA had become negative. A good correlation was observed between DAINA and RPHA with a concordance rate of 99.5%. A good correlation of HBsAg titer between the two methods was observed and found to be significant (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). HBsAg assay was able to be completed within 15 minutes by DAINA and the procedure was simple. These results indicate that the sensitivity of DAINA is superior to RPHA and it is easy to use.	0

Heart transplantation is accepted worldwide as the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage heart disease who have a life expectancy of less than 1 year. Mechanical Cardiac assistance might be necessary as a bridge to transplantation and, in selected cases, to multiorgan transplantation. We report a successful case of a 15-day extracorporeal membrane oxygenator assistance as bridge to combined heart and liver transplantation in a young man with dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic hepatitis C virus infection.	0
21520702	Plant phenolics in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Epidemiological studies indicate that populations consuming high levels of plant derived foods have low incidence rates of various cancers. Recent findings implicate a variety of phytochemicals, including phenolics, in these anticancer properties. Both monophenolic and polyphenolic compounds from a large variety of plant foods, spices and beverages have been shown to inhibit or attenuate the initiation, progression and spread of cancers in cells in vitro and in animals in vivo. The cellular mechanisms that phenolics modulate to elicit these anticancer effects are multi-faceted and include regulation of growth factor-receptor interactions and cell signaling cascades, including kinases and transcription factors, that determine the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, cell survival and apoptosis or programmed cell death. A major focus has been the inhibitory effects of phenolics on the stress-activated NF-KB and AP-1 signal cascades in cancer cells which are regarded as major therapeutic targets. Phenolics can enhance the body's immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells as well as inhibiting the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) that is necessary for tumour growth. They also attenuate adhesiveness and invasiveness of cancer cells thereby reducing their metastatic potential. Augmentation of the efficacy ofstandard chemo- and radiotherapeutic treatment regimes and the prevention of resistance to these agents is another important effect of plant phenolics that warrants further research. Plant phenolics appear to have both preventative and treatment potential in combating cancer and warrant further, in-depth research. It is interesting that these effects of plant phenolics on cancer inhibition resemble effects reported for specific fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA, conjugated linoleic acids). Although phenolic effects in cells in vitro and in animal models are generally positive, observations from the less numerous human interventions are less clear. This is surprising given the positive epidemiological data and may relate to mixed diets and synergistic interactions between compounds or the bioavailability of individual compounds. Much of the work in vitro with phenolic compounds has utilized concentrations higher than the amount that can be obtained from the diet suggesting a role of fortified, functional foods in cancer suppression.	0
24082358	In vitro and in vivo Antiinflammatory Activity of Clerodendrum paniculatum Linn. Leaves. Preliminary phytochemical screening showed the presence of terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids, phenolic acid, sterols, and glycosides. This study was intended to evaluate the antiinflammatory activity of various extracts of fresh leaves of Clerodendrum paniculatum Linn experimentally by in vitro (human red blood cell membrane stabilization method) and in vivo methods (0.1 ml of 1% w/v carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema model). Petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, alcohol, and aqueous extracts were screened for in vitro antiinflammatory activity. Petroleum ether and chloroform extracts which showed, best in vitro antiinflammatory activity was screened for in vivo antiinflammatory activity at the dose level of 200 and 400 mg/kg. Indomethacin at the dose level of 10 mg/kg was used as reference standard drug. Both the extracts showed a dose dependent significant (P<0.001) reduction in paw edema when compared to the control, at all the time intervals and comparable to indomethacin (reference standard) treated group. The results of the present study demonstrate that petroleum ether and chloroform extracts possess significant (P<0.001) antiinflammatory potential which provide scientific basis for the traditional claims of Clerodendrum paniculatum Linn leaves as an antiinflammatory drug.	0
20888839	Substance abuse, adherence with antiretroviral therapy, and clinical outcomes among HIV-infected individuals. Substance abuse and addiction are highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals. Substance abuse is an important comorbidity that affects the delivery and outcomes of HIV medical management. In this paper I will review data examining the associations between substance abuse and HIV treatment and potential strategies to improve outcomes in this population that warrant further investigation. Current - but not past - substance abuse adversely affects engagement in care, acceptance of antiretroviral therapy, adherence with therapy, and long-term persistence in care. Substance abuse treatment appears to facilitate engagement in HIV care, and access to evidence-based treatment for substance abuse is central to addressing the HIV epidemic. Strategies that show promise for HIV-infected substance abusers include integrated treatment models, directly observed therapy, and incentive-based interventions.	0

10951845	[Detection of multiple myeloma cells using multicolor immunofluorescence and flow cytometry]. The advent of new therapeutic approaches to multiple myeloma made necessary the introduction of novel methods for detection of minimal residual disease. Among others approaches residual disease can be detected by the immunofluorescence using flow cytometry. We have examined the co-expression of CD19, CD38, CD45, CD54, CD56, and CD138 molecules in cells of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates in patients with multiple myeloma by 3-color flow cytometry. For the detection and characterization of multiple myeloma cells, combinations of following antibodies were used: anti-CD19 FITC, anti-CD38 FITC, anti-CD38 PE, anti-CD54 FITC, anti-CD56 PE-Cy5, anti-CD45 PE, anti-CD45 PE-Cy5 (Immunotech) and anti CD138 PE (Serotec). The samples were analyzed using EPICS XL (Coulter) flow cytometer, and the analysis was based on at least 10,000 events. Samples from 17 patients were analyzed. The percentage of multiple myeloma cells ranged between 0.3% and 54.2% in bone marrow aspirates and between 0.0 and 11.8% in periferal blood. The expression of CD138, CD38, CD54 and CD56 molecules was found in 100%, 100%, 85% and 68% of examined cases, respectively. In our opinion, multiple myeloma cells are best characterized by following combinations of antibodies: CD38 FITC/CD138 PE/CD45 PE-Cy5, CD54 FITC/CD138 PE/CD56 PE-Cy5 or CD54 FITC/CD38 PE/CD 56 PE-Cy5. The identification of a malignant clone is the first and the most important step in the characterization of the disease, determination of its prognosis and the detection of residual disease after treatment. Three-color flow cytometry represents a method which can meet these goals.	0
21167867	Inhibition of HBV replication by theophylline. We have suggested recently that ATM-Rad3-Related (ATR) DNA damage signaling pathway, which responds to single-strand breaks in DNA, was activated in response to HBV infection. ATR knockdown cells showed decreased HBV DNA yields, implying HBV infection and replication activate and exploit the activated DNA damage response. Host cell proteins may constitute an attractive target for anti-HBV-1 therapeutics, since development of drug resistance against compounds targeting these cellular cofactor proteins is unlikely. In this study, we show that one of the clinically used compounds of ATR and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinases inhibitor, theophylline (Tp), significantly reduced the yield of HBV DNA, HBsAg and HBeAg in HepG2215 cell culture system, furthermore, Tp could also suppress serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in the HBV-transgenic mice. Consistent with this result, immunohistology also showed reduced intensity of HBsAg staining on livers from Tp-treatment group. Taken together, these data indicated the feasibility of therapeutic approaches that target host cell proteins by inhibiting a cellular gene that was required for HBV replication and provided a potential approach for the prevention and treatment of HBV infection.	0
22845635	Nursing documentation: experience of the use of the nursing process model in selected hospitals in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The descriptive study was conducted to determine the extent of utilization of the nursing process for documentation of nursing care in three selected hospitals, Ibadan, Nigeria. One hundred fifty nurses and 115 discharged clients' records were selected from the hospitals. Questionnaires and checklists were used to collect data. Utilization of nursing process for care was 100%, 73.6% and 34.8% in the three hospitals. Nurses encountered difficulties in history taking, formulation of nursing diagnoses, objectives, nursing orders and evaluation. Most nurses disagreed or were undecided with the use of authorized abbreviations and symbols (34.3%, 40.3% and 69.5%), recording errors that occurred during care (37.1%, 56.1% and 52.2%) and inclusion of change in clients' condition (54.3%, 56.1% and 73.8%). Most nurses appreciated the significance of documentation. Lack of time, knowledge and need for extensive writing are the major barriers against documentation. Seventy-seven point four per cent of the 115 clients' records from one hospital showed evidence of documentation, no evidence from the other two. Study findings have implications for continuing professional education, practice and supervision.	0

15290420	The volatile anesthetics halothane and isoflurane differentially modulate proinflammatory cytokine-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. PURPOSE: Volatile anesthetics affect the cardiovascular and immune systems. Toward a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the modulation exerted by these agents, we focused on the effects of halothane and isoflurane on the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which plays a critical role in the cellular responses to extracellular stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 (IL-1). METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HeLa cells, an established cell line, were examined by molecular biological methods. Cells were treated with proinflammatory compounds with or without the volatile anesthetics. p38 MAPK activation was investigated by Western blotting analysis with phosphospecific anti-p38 MAPK antibodies. RESULTS: Isoflurane activated p38 MAPK by itself, but halothane did not. Halothane or isoflurane augmented the LPS- and TNF-induced activation of p38 MAPK. In contrast, neither halothane nor isoflurane enhanced the p38 MAPK activation induced by IL-1. Neither of the anesthetics affected H(2)O(2) or MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3)-induced p38 MAPK activation. CONCLUSION: Our in vitro results indicate that the volatile anesthetics used in the clinical field and in animal experiments modify the p38 MAPK signaling cascade and suggest that the target molecules of the anesthetics are not unique and the anesthetics regulate them differentially at clinically relevant doses.	0
19180468	Epithelial expression of human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein results in peripheral CD8 T-cell suppression mediated by CD4+CD25+ T cells. The role of thymic versus peripheral epithelium in the regulation of the antigen-specific CD8 T-cell repertoire is still largely unresolved. We generated TCR-beta chain transgenic mice in which an increased frequency of peripheral CD8 T cells recognizes an epitope from a viral oncoprotein (HPV16E7) in the context of H-2D(b) MHC class I. When T cells from these mice developed through the thymus of mice expressing functional E7 protein from a keratin 14 promoter, no major perturbation to transgenic T-cell development in the thymus was observed in these double-transgenic mice. In contrast, peripheral CD8 T-cell responses in the single-transgenic, K14E7 mice, including those unrelated to E7 antigen, are reduced whereas CD4 T-cell responses and antibody production are unchanged in these mice. Peripheral non-responsiveness among CD8 T cells was mediated largely by CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. This suggested that epithelium expressing HPV16E7 protein induces Treg that specifically down-regulate CD8 T-cell responses in the periphery. This may have important consequences for the treatment of cervical pre-cancers and provides a model for understanding differential suppression of T and B lymphocyte subsets by Treg.	0

10894239	Predicting recovery from acute asthma in an emergency diagnostic and treatment unit. OBJECTIVE: Optimal use of emergency diagnostic and treatment unit (EDTU) resources for treatment of acute asthma should be facilitated by the selection of patients with a high probability of discharge from the EDTU. The study goal was to identify characteristics of the patient or exacerbation that could be used to predict recovery of pulmonary function within 12 hours. METHODS: Comprehensive cohort design in an urban public hospital. The subjects were 269 patients with moderately severe asthma exacerbations. Data were collected for historical and presenting features and response to treatment over 12 hours. Two outcomes were examined: 1) discharge from the EDTU and 2) achieving 50% predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) within 12 hours. RESULTS: The two outcomes showed good concordance. The third-treatment PEFR was found to be predictive of both discharge and reaching 50% predicted PEFR within 12 hours. Since the objective measure of reaching 50% predicted PEFR is more readily defined and thus more generalizable, the authors focused on this outcome when describing prediction zones. Patients with 40% or higher PEFR after third treatment had an 89% probability of reaching 50% predicted in 12 hours, while those with a third-treatment PEFR lower than 32% predicted had only a 22% probability. CONCLUSIONS: A simple objective measure of pulmonary function early in treatment discriminated among those with high, low, and intermediate probabilities of achieving a specified level of PEFR within 12 hours. Awareness of this probability could assist clinicians attempting to predict discharge from the EDTU and facilitate decision making regarding utilization of EDTU resources.	0
22998650	Coexistence of macro- and micro-vascular abnormalities in newly diagnosed normal tension glaucoma patients. PURPOSE: To investigate the coexistence of ocular microvascular and systemic macrovascular abnormalities in early stage, newly diagnosed and previously untreated normal tension glaucoma patients (NTG). METHODS: Retinal vascular reactivity to flickering light was assessed in 19 NTG and 28 age-matched controls by means of dynamic retinal vessel analysis (IMEDOS GmbH, Jena, Germany). Using a newly developed computational model, the entire dynamic vascular response profile to flicker light was imaged and used for analysis. In addition, assessments of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and pulse wave analysis (PWA) were conducted on all participants, along with blood pressure (BP) measurements and blood analyses for lipid metabolism markers. RESULTS:    Patients with NTG demonstrated an increased right and left carotid IMT (p   =   0.015, p   =   0.045) and an elevated PWA augmentation index (p   =   0.017) in comparison with healthy controls, along with an enhanced retinal arterial constriction response (p   =   0.028), a steeper retinal arterial constriction slope (p   =   0.031) and a reduced retinal venous dilation response (p   =   0.026) following flicker light stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Early stage, newly diagnosed, NTG patients showed signs of subclinical vascular abnormalities at both macro- and micro-vascular levels, highlighting the need to consider multi-level circulation-related pathologies in the development and progression of this type of glaucoma.	0

20013951	Reduction of bias in static closed chamber measurement of delta13C in soil CO2 efflux. The (13)C/(12)C ratio of soil CO(2) efflux (delta(e)) is an important parameter in studies of ecosystem C dynamics, where the accuracy of estimated C flux rates depends on the measurement uncertainty of delta(e). The static closed chamber method is frequently used in the determination of delta(e), where the soil CO(2) efflux is accumulated in the headspace of a chamber placed on top of the soil surface. However, it has recently been shown that the estimate of delta(e) obtained by using this method could be significantly biased, which potentially diminish the usefulness of delta(e) for field applications. Here, analytical and numerical models were used to express the bias in delta(e) as mathematical functions of three system parameters: chamber height (H), chamber radius (R(c)), and soil air-filled porosity (theta). These expressions allow optimization of chamber size to yield a bias, which is at a level suitable for each particular application of the method. The numerical model was further used to quantify the effects on the delta(e) bias from (i) various designs for sealing of the chamber to ground, and (ii) inclusion of the commonly used purging step for reduction of the initial headspace CO(2) concentration. The present modeling work provided insights into the effects on the delta(e) bias from retardation and partial chamber bypass of the soil CO(2) efflux. The results presented here supported the continued use of the static closed chamber method for the determination of delta(e), with improved control of the bias component of its measurement uncertainty.	0
21576508	Single-cell analysis of the human T regulatory population uncovers functional heterogeneity and instability within FOXP3+ cells. Natural FOXP3(+)CD4(+)CD25(High) regulatory T cells are critical in immunological self-tolerance. Their characterization in humans is hindered by the failure to discriminate these cells from activated effector T cells in inflammation. To explore the relationship between FOXP3 expression and regulatory function at the clonal level, we used a single-cell cloning strategy of CD25-expressing CD4(+) T cell subsets from healthy human donors. Our approach unveils a functional heterogeneity nested within CD4(+)CD25(High)FOXP3(+) T cells, and typically not revealed by conventional bulk assays. Whereas most cells display the canonical regulatory T (T(reg)) cell characteristics, a significant proportion of FOXP3(+) T cells is compromised in its suppressive function, despite the maintenance of other phenotypic and functional regulatory T hallmark features. In addition, these nonsuppressive FOXP3(+) T cells preferentially emerge from the CD45RO(+) memory pool, and arise as a consequence of a rapid downregulation of FOXP3 expression upon T cell reactivation. Surprisingly, these dysfunctional T(reg) cells with unstable FOXP3 expression do not manifest overt plasticity in terms of inflammatory cytokine secretion. These results open a path to an extensive study of the functional heterogeneity of CD4(+)CD25(High)FOXP3(+) T(reg) cells and warrant caution in the sole use of FOXP3 as a clinical marker for monitoring of immune regulation in humans.	0
8082358	CPAP therapy via oronasal mask for obstructive sleep apnea. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of oronasal masks for positive pressure therapy in alleviating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Polysomnographic records of all 245 patients with OSA who underwent therapeutic trials of either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure between January 1991 and December 1992 were reviewed. Thirty patients who had been prescribed positive pressure therapy employing an oronasal mask were identified. Two patients known to be successfully treated with CPAP via oronasal mask underwent repeat polysomnography. The initial portion of the study was a diagnostic evaluation during which the patients were untreated. During the second portion of the study, both patients used CPAP via an oronasal mask while wearing a mouthpiece designed to maintain oral patency. RESULTS: The 30 patients with OSA who were identified in this study had significant amelioration of OSA while receiving positive pressure therapy via oronasal mask compared with the baseline, diagnostic polysomnogram (apnea index: 55.3 +/- 36.9-->1.6 +/- 3.7, p < 0.001; hypopnea index: 21.2 +/- 20-->2.7 +/- 4.9, p < 0.001; nadir of SaO2: 72.5 +/- 13.9-->87.1 +/- 4.3, p < 0.001, mean +/- SD). Improvement of OSA did not depend on maintenance of a closed mouth, as evidenced by elimination of sleep-disordered breathing in the two patients receiving positive pressure via oronasal mask while wearing a mouthpiece to keep the mouth open. CONCLUSION: Oronasal masks are a viable alternative interface for alleviating OSA with positive pressure therapy in those patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate conventional nasal interfaces. Although there were no adverse consequences associated with the use of oronasal masks in our patients, appropriate safety precautions should be taken to minimize the possibility of aspiration of gastric contents and avoid untoward sequelae due to positive pressure device failure.	0
10871389	Preparation of DNA and protein micro arrays on glass slides coated with an agarose film. A thin layered agarose film on microscope slides provides a versatile support for the preparation of arrayed molecular libraries. An activation step leading to the formation of aldehyde groups in the agarose creates reactive sites that allow covalent immobilization of molecules containing amino groups. Arrays of oligonucleotides and PCR products were prepared by tip printing. After hybridization with complementary fluorescence labeled nucleic acid probes strong fluorescence signals of sequence-specific binding to the immobilized probes were detected. The intensity of the fluorescence signals was proportional to the relative amount of immobilized oligonucleotides and to the concentration of the fluorescence labeled probe. We also used the agarose film-coated slides for the preparation of protein arrays. In combination with specific fluorescence labeled antibodies these protein arrays can be used for fluorescence linked immune assays. With this approach different protein tests can be performed in parallel in a single reaction with minimal amounts of the binding reagents.	0
21835734	[Not Available]. The authors emphasize that late results following surgery for pancreatic cancer can be improved by increasing the rate of R0 resections. Therefore, they propose a new method for pancreatic head resection, which starts with the dissection of the uncinate process and continues in a caudo-cranial direction (retrograde). Thus the superior mesenteric artery comes into view at the beginning, and the peripancreatic tissues can be removed completely along the vessel consequently. This method can potentially decrease the risk of the bleeding and major vessel injury. The authors carried out six pancreatic head resections with the technique mentioned above, and histology revealed R0 resection in all six cases. Non-traditional, retrograde dissection of the pancreatic head is a recommended method which is supported by literature data as well as the authors' own experience.	0
23684518	Variants of hepatic arterial supply in a Caribbean population: a computed tomography based study. AIM: To evaluate the spectrum of hepatic arterial variants in unselected patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen at the main regional referral centre in the northern Anglophone Caribbean. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two radiologists independently reviewed 309 CT angiographic studies performed over 2 years between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2012 at a regional hepatobiliary referral centre for the Northern Caribbean. The anatomical variations were described according to a conventional classification proposed by Michels et al. RESULTS: In this Caribbean population, the majority of patients had conventional Michels' type 1 vascular anatomy (63.4%). However, a statistically significantly greater incidence of Michels' type 2 variations (20.4%) were found than that reported in the international literature and a lower incidence of type 3 (5.2%), type 6 (0.6%), and type 9 (0) patterns than previously reported. One case with variations not previously described in this classification was also encountered. CONCLUSION: Although 63.4% of persons in a Caribbean population have conventional vascular anatomy, the distribution of anatomical variants is quite different to that seen in North American and European centres. Interventional radiologists and hepatobiliary surgeons practicing in the Caribbean must be cognizant of these differences in order to minimize morbidity and mortality during invasive procedures.	0

9322682	ATG plus corticosteroid therapy for acute graft-versus-host disease: predictors of response and survival. Innovative treatment strategies for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) have not replaced corticosteroids as the primary therapy. We retrospectively reviewed 74 patients who received equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in addition to corticosteroids as therapy for GVHD, 21 who received primary therapy and 53 who received ATG after progressing or failing to improve with corticosteroids alone. The groups were comparable in clinical characteristics and in timing and severity of GVHD. After primary therapy with ATG 67% of patients' GVHD symptoms were stable or improved by 28 days versus 56% in those receiving secondary ATG (p = 0.57). In univariate analysis the absence of multiple organ, GI, and liver aGVHD and a clinical stage score < or = 4 were predictive of a favorable response, while in a multivariate logistic regression model only a clinical stage score < or = 4 was independently associated with a favorable response (odds ratio 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.32, p = 0.003). ATG response rates and 6-month survival (38 vs. 40%, p = 0.89) were similar following primary and secondary ATG. Patients stable or improved 28 days after ATG therapy had a significantly better 6-month survival than those whose aGVHD had progressed (50 vs. 30%, p = 0.02). Further study is required to assess whether some initial presentations of aGVHD would predictably fail corticosteroid therapy and may thus suggest a role for ATG in the primary management of aGVHD. For this determination, formal prospective comparative trials are needed.	0
23432833	SES differences in language processing skill and vocabulary are evident at 18 months. This research revealed both similarities and striking differences in early language proficiency among infants from a broad range of advantaged and disadvantaged families. English-learning infants (n = 48) were followed longitudinally from 18 to 24 months, using real-time measures of spoken language processing. The first goal was to track developmental changes in processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning in this diverse sample. The second goal was to examine differences in these crucial aspects of early language development in relation to family socioeconomic status (SES). The most important findings were that significant disparities in vocabulary and language processing efficiency were already evident at 18 months between infants from higher- and lower-SES families, and by 24 months there was a 6-month gap between SES groups in processing skills critical to language development.	0
17691719	Nonbonding orbitals in fullerenes: nuts and cores in singular polyhedral graphs. A zero eigenvalue in the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the graph representing an unsaturated carbon framework indicates the presence of a nonbonding pi orbital (NBO). A graph with at least one zero in the spectrum is singular; nonzero entries in the corresponding zero-eigenvalue eigenvector(s) (kernel eigenvectors) identify the core vertices. A nut graph has a single zero in its adjacency spectrum with a corresponding eigenvector for which all vertices lie in the core. Balanced and uniform trivalent (cubic) nut graphs are defined in terms of (-2, +1, +1) patterns of eigenvector entries around all vertices. In balanced nut graphs all vertices have such a pattern up to a scale factor; uniform nut graphs are balanced with scale factor one for every vertex. Nut graphs are rare among small fullerenes (41 of the 10 190 782 fullerene isomers on up to 120 vertices) but common among the small trivalent polyhedra (62 043 of the 398 383 nonbipartite polyhedra on up to 24 vertices). Two constructions are described, one that is conjectured to yield an infinite series of uniform nut fullerenes, and another that is conjectured to yield an infinite series of cubic polyhedral nut graphs. All hypothetical nut fullerenes found so far have some pentagon adjacencies: it is proved that all uniform nut fullerenes must have such adjacencies and that the NBO is totally symmetric in all balanced nut fullerenes. A single electron placed in the NBO of a uniform nut fullerene gives a spin density distribution with the smallest possible (4:1) ratio between most and least populated sites for an NBO. It is observed that, in all nut-fullerene graphs found so far, occupation of the NBO would require the fullerene to carry at least 3 negative charges, whereas in most carbon cages based on small nut cubic polyhedra, the NBO would be the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for the uncharged system.	0

18601703	Neuroendocrinology and aging. This short review goes back to early discoveries concerning the neuroendocrinology of aging, discussing the Brown-Sequard experiment on rejuvenation at the end of the 19th century and Steinach's subsequent experiments in the early 20th century. It also considers the seminal experiments of Pierre Ascheim, Ming Tsung Peng and Joseph Meites in the 1960s on the aging of the gonadotrophic axis. Major age-associated changes in neuroendocrine regulatory processes involved in the menopausal transition, andropause, somatopause and adrenopause are also reviewed. Finally, some views on future directions of research into the neuroendocrinology of aging are proposed, based on the pleiotropy of neuroendocrine messengers and functions.	0

8971647	Application of a newly developed 3-D deformation measurement system to prosthetic dentistry. A new system for measuring three-dimensional deformation has been developed. The main components of the system are a fixed TV camera and vertically scanning projectors. The advantages of the system are: (1) since there is no mechanical contact between the object and the sensing unit, hardness and form of the object do not have to be considered; (2) the system does not need any precise geometry except for the reproducibility of the vertical scanning stage; (3) the time required for one measurements is extremely short; and (4) the system is not expensive. From the basic experiments for testing accuracy, this system has about +/- 30 microns range deviation against 1000 microns deformation of the object. The system has been applied to investigate the influence of various impression procedures for a removable partial denture on the displacement of the simulated soft mucosal tissue. It is revealed that deformation forms are expressed precisely. Our results suggest that this measurement system is quite useful for research in dentistry and that it could be widely applied.	0
21504500	Time course of acetylcholine-induced activation of sympathetic efferents matches axon reflex sweating in humans. Action potentials from postganglionic C-fibres were recorded in healthy volunteers by microneurography in the peroneal nerve. Their responsiveness to mechanical or heat stimuli or to sympathetic reflex provocation tests was determined by transient slowing of conduction velocity following activation. Twenty units were classified as sympathetic efferent units. Acetylcholine (ACh) iontophoresis (10%, 1 mA, 1 min) inside their innervation territory activated 8 of 20 sympathetic fibres with a mean delay of 61    12 s, peak response at 175    38 s, and a duration of 240    42 s, whereas iontophoresis of saline did not activate any of them. The time course of neuronal activation correlated with the axon reflex sweating measured by an evaporimeter in a separate session (delay 76    9 s, peak at 195    12 s, decline to 50% of peak 312    25 s). No ACh-induced vasoconstriction was observed by laser Doppler scanning (n = 11) even after depletion of neuropeptides by chronic topical capsaicin treatment (n = 8). We conclude that ACh iontophoresis activates about half of the sympathetic fibres in human skin and provokes a corresponding axon reflex sweating. The absence of ACh-induced vasoconstriction even after the depletion of neuropeptides by capsaicin suggests that only sudomotor fibres, but not sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibres are activated by this stimulus.	0
17616112	Is there a general rule for the gauche effect in the conformational isomerism of 1,2-disubstituted ethanes? The stabilities of the gauche and anti conformations of butane, 1,2-dicyanoethane (DCE), and 1,2-dinitroethane (DNE) have been investigated through theoretical calculations. The gauche effect-the tendency of keeping close vicinal electronegative substituents (thetaX-C-C-X approximately 60 degrees ) in an ethane fragment-is expected to drive the conformational equilibrium of DCE and DNE toward the gauche conformation. It was found that, for butane, where the gauche effect is supposed to be poor/null, the hyperconjugation effect contributes mostly to the anti stabilization in opposition to the traditional sense that the methyl groups repel each other, and this should govern its conformational equilibrium. For DCE the equilibrium was shifted to the anti conformer, essentially due to a gauche repulsion, while for DNE, despite the higher electronic delocalization energies, a predominance of the gauche conformer was obtained, and this was attributed mainly to the attractive dipolar interaction between the two nitro groups. A full orbital energy analysis was performed using the natural bond orbital approach, which showed that bond bending and anti-C-H/C-X* hyperconjugation models, usually applied to explain the origin of the gauche effect in fluorinated derivatives, are not adequate to completely explain the conformational behavior of the titled compounds.	0
7554909	Alternative splicing of amelogenins. Amelogenins comprise as much as 90% of the protein in the developing enamel matrix. Separating amelogenins by gel electrophoresis reveals a complex of polypeptides with apparent mobilities ranging from low molecular weight species on up to 28,000 Daltons. A major objective of our research is determine the extent to which alternative RNA splicing contributes to this heterogeneity. We have cloned seven alternatively spliced mouse amelogenin mRNAs. The predicted translation products of these messages are 194, 180, 156, 141, 74, 59, and 44 amino acids in length. The 194 residue amelogenin is the only mouse amelogenin to include a polypeptide segment encoded by exon 4, which has a deduced amino acid sequence of KSHSQAINTDRTAL. Antibodies were raised against synthetic exon 4 encoded polypeptides and used to immunostain histologic tooth sections. These data indicate that alternatively spliced amelogenin mRNAs are translated into protein and secreted into the enamel matrix.	0

We describe a technique that uses flexible iris retractors in a diamond configuration for small-pupil extracapsular or intracapsular cataract surgery in eyes with unusually dense nuclear sclerosis. Advantages of this technique include ease of conversion from phacoemulsification, optimal orientation of the maximum pupil diameter for nucleus expression or intracapsular lens removal, and conservation of iris tissue.	0

17290279	Chronic kidney disease in long-term survivors of hematopoietic cell transplant. We conducted a cohort study to identify risk factors of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among long-term survivors of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). We studied 1635 patients transplanted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) between 1991 and 2002, who survived to day +131 after transplant and had serum creatinine measured on at least two occasions after day +131. CKD was defined as a glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min/m(2) on two occasions separated by at least 30 days between days 100 and 540 post transplant. Cox regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) describing associations between demographic data, clinical variables and the risk of developing CKD. A total of 376 patients (23%) developed CKD at a median of 191 days post transplant (range 131-516 days). An increased risk of CKD was associated with acute renal failure (ARF) (HR=1.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.1), acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD) grade II (HR=2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.9) and grades III/IV (HR=3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.6) and chronic GVHD (HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.2). Total body irradiation (TBI) (HR=1.0, 95% CI 0.8-1.3) was not associated with an increased risk of CKD. CKD is relatively common among survivors of HCT. The presence of ARF and GVHD, but not receipt of TBI, appears to be associated with the occurrence of CKD.	0
16712421	A high-throughput microfluidic assay for SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 2. SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) is a potential drug target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This enzyme serves as a negative regulator of insulin-mediated signal transduction by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of the second messenger lipid molecule phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Traditionally, assays for phosphoinositide phosphatases such as SHIP2 have relied on radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol-containing lipid membranes and chromatographic separation of labeled phospholipid substrate from product by thin-layer chromatography. We have expressed and purified catalytically active phosphatase domain constructs of SHIP2 from Escherichia coli and developed a sensitive and antibody- or binding protein-independent assay for SHIP2 amenable to high-throughput screening of phosphoinositide phosphatases or phosphoinositide kinases. This microfluidic assay, with Z' values approximately 0.8, is based upon the difference in mobility within an electric field between a fluorophore-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate substrate and the corresponding 3,4-bisphosphate product. High-throughput screening of a 91,060-member compound library in 384-well format resulted in the identification of SHIP2 inhibitors.	0
23881923	BMN 673, a novel and highly potent PARP1/2 inhibitor for the treatment of human cancers with DNA repair deficiency. PURPOSE: PARP1/2 inhibitors are a class of anticancer agents that target tumor-specific defects in DNA repair. Here, we describe BMN 673, a novel, highly potent PARP1/2 inhibitor with favorable metabolic stability, oral bioavailability, and pharmacokinetic properties. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Potency and selectivity of BMN 673 was determined by biochemical assays. Anticancer activity either as a single-agent or in combination with other antitumor agents was evaluated both in vitro and in xenograft cancer models. RESULTS: BMN 673 is a potent PARP1/2 inhibitor (PARP1 IC50 = 0.57 nmol/L), but it does not inhibit other enzymes that we have tested. BMN 673 exhibits selective antitumor cytotoxicity and elicits DNA repair biomarkers at much lower concentrations than earlier generation PARP1/2 inhibitors (such as olaparib, rucaparib, and veliparib). In vitro, BMN 673 selectively targeted tumor cells with BRCA1, BRCA2, or PTEN gene defects with 20- to more than 200-fold greater potency than existing PARP1/2 inhibitors. BMN 673 is readily orally bioavailable, with more than 40% absolute oral bioavailability in rats when dosed in carboxylmethyl cellulose. Oral administration of BMN 673 elicited remarkable antitumor activity in vivo; xenografted tumors that carry defects in DNA repair due to BRCA mutations or PTEN deficiency were profoundly sensitive to oral BMN 673 treatment at well-tolerated doses in mice. Synergistic or additive antitumor effects were also found when BMN 673 was combined with temozolomide, SN38, or platinum drugs. CONCLUSION: BMN 673 is currently in early-phase clinical development and represents a promising PARP1/2 inhibitor with potentially advantageous features in its drug class.	0
17612511	Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibits glutamatergic synaptic transmission in dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dl-PAG). The purpose of this study was to determine the role of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in modulating neuronal activity of the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dl-PAG) through excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. First, whole cell voltage-clamp recording was performed to obtain excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) of the dl-PAG neurons. Our results show that PGE(2) significantly decreased the frequency of miniature EPSCs and amplitude of evoked EPSCs. The effects were mimicked by sulprostone, an agonist to PGE(2) EP(3) receptors. In contrast, PGE(2) had no distinct effect on IPSCs. In addition, spontaneous action potential of the dl-PAG neurons was recorded using whole cell current-clamp methods. PGE(2) significantly attenuated the discharge rate of the dl-PAG neurons. The decreased firing activity was abolished in the presence of glutamate NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists. The results from the current study provide the first evidence indicating that PGE(2) inhibits the neuronal activity of the dl-PAG via selective attenuation of glutamatergic synaptic inputs, likely due to the activation of presynaptic EP(3) receptors.	0

19626913	[Determination of trace elements in Mongolian medicine Susi-12 curing cholecystitis and gallstone disease by ICP-AES]. Trace elements in Mongolian medicine Susi-12 for cholecystitis and gallstones were analyzed in order to discuss the relation between Susi-12's drug action and the trace elements. The analysis was carried out using the pressure seal microwave digestion and inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). It was found that the medicine contained great amount of trace elements, especially human-body-needed trace elements, such as Ca, Al, Mg, Fe, Sr, Mn, Zn, Cu etc., whereas heavy metals are very little, e.g. the contents of Pb, Cb, As etc are below the country's limit. The recoveries of standard addition are in the range of 94.63%-106.40%. The relative standard deviation RSD< or =3.35%, and detection limit is < or =0.009 mg x L(-1). It is concluded that Mongolian medicine Susi-12 can effectively control and cure cholecystitis and gallstones, and the effective rate reaches 91.2% to 100%. So the trace elements in Susi-12 must have a close connection with the drug action.	0
23433593	The lung cancer patient at the emergency department: a three-year retrospective study. INTRODUCTION: Currently, there are limited data on the lung cancer patient at the emergency department. Our objective is to review the medical charts of those patients to determine the frequency and main causes of emergency consultations and the predicting factors for hospital admissions and deaths. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study including all patients with lung cancer consulting at the emergency department of a cancer hospital. RESULTS: From January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010, 269 patients with lung cancer presented at the emergency, corresponding to 548 consultations (8.3% of all 6575 visits). During the same period, 626 patients for lung cancer were treated in our institution meaning that 43% of them are consulting at least once the emergency department during the course of their disease. The main reasons for consultation were respiratory symptoms (22.3%) and fever (19.9%). Emergency visit leads to hospital admission in 63% of the cases. In multivariate analysis, the main independent predictor factor of hospitalisation is arrival by ambulance (odd ratio 12), which is also the principal predictor of death during hospitalisation (odd ratio 9.5). The presence of signs at physical examination is also an important factor. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that emergency visit is a frequent event for lung cancer patients and has identified simple factors predicting hospitalisation and deaths.	0

23869937	Quantification, mechanism, and mitigation of active ingredient phase transformation in tablets. Model tablet formulations containing thiamine hydrochloride [as a nonstoichiometric hydrate (NSH)] and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) were prepared. In intact tablets, the water released by dehydration of DCPD mediated the transition of NSH to thiamine hydrochloride hemihydrate (HH). The use of an X-ray microdiffractometer with an area detector enabled us to rapidly and simultaneously monitor both the phase transformations. The spatial information, gained by monitoring the tablet from the surface to the core (depth profiling), revealed that both DCPD dehydration and HH formation progressed from the surface to the tablet core as a function of storage time. Film coating of the tablets with ethyl cellulose caused a decrease in both the reaction rates. There was a pronounced lag time, but once initiated, the transformations occurred simultaneously throughout the tablet. Thus the difference in the phase transformation behavior between the uncoated and the coated tablets could not have been discerned without the depth profiling. Incorporation of hydrophilic colloidal silica as a formulation component further slowed down the transformations. By acting as a water scavenger it maintained a very \"dry\" environment in the tablet matrix. Finally, by coating the NSH particles with hydrophobic colloidal silica, the formation of HH was further substantially decelerated. The microdiffractometric technique not only enabled direct analyses of tablets but also provided the critical spatial information. This helped in the selection of excipients with appropriate functionality to prevent the in situ phase transformations.	0

16084158	Comparison of losartan and captopril on heart failure-related outcomes and symptoms from the losartan heart failure survival study (ELITE II). BACKGROUND: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improves outcomes and symptoms in patients with heart failure (HF). We compared effects of losartan to captopril on mortality, morbidity, and functional status for patients in the ELITE II study. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 3152 patients, aged 60 years or older, with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II to IV HF and ejection fraction < or = 40% were assigned to receive losartan 50 mg once daily or captopril 50 mg 3 times daily. Outcome measures included all-cause and HF-related mortality, hospitalizations, and discontinuations; change in NYHA class; and quality of life (QoL). HF-related outcomes were not significantly different between therapies. Similar improvements from baseline (P < .01) in NYHA class were observed within both treatment groups. Among 1856 QoL participants, 1343 patients survived at least 1 year; the QoL for 1-year survivors improved in both treatment groups (P < .001 vs baseline) and did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In ELITE II, the effects of losartan on HF-related outcomes, NYHA class, and QoL were not superior to those of captopril. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain the treatment of choice for patients with HF, the similarity of the findings in the present analysis supports a role for angiotensin-receptor antagonists in this patient population.	0
24399190	Peptide vaccines for hematological malignancies: a missed promise? Despite the crucial aid that newly developed target therapies are providing to chemotherapy and stem cell transplant, the cure for many hematological malignancies is still an unmet need. Although available therapies are able to induce an effective debulking of the tumor, most of the time, an insidious minimal residual disease survives current treatments and it is responsible for an immediate or delayed relapse. Peptide-derived antitumor vaccines have been developed with the idea that an artificially \"educated\" immune system may exert an active specific antitumor response able to control and ultimately eradicate underlying post-treatment residual disease. This review will summarize current knowledge of peptide vaccines for hematological malignancies, trying to analyze promises and pitfalls of a safe and intelligent tool that after many years from its first appearance has not yet established its potential role as alternative immune mediated therapeutic approach for hematopoietic tumors.	0
21310198	Human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene expression in the osteosarcoma line U2OS is repressed by the cell protein ATRX. The control of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early (IE) gene expression in infected human fibroblasts was compared with that in the U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. Viral IE expression was stimulated by the virion protein pp71 and repressed by the cell protein hDaxx in fibroblasts, as expected from published data. Neither of these events occurred in infected U2OS cells, suggesting that this cell line lacks one or more factors that repress HCMV IE expression. The chromatin remodeling factor ATRX is absent from U2OS cells, therefore the effect of introducing this protein by electroporation of plasmid DNA was investigated. Provision of ATRX inhibited HCMV IE expression, and the presence of the HCMV-specified virion phosphoprotein pp71 overcame the repression. The experiments demonstrate that ATRX can act as a cellular intrinsic antiviral defense in U2OS cells by blocking gene expression from incoming HCMV genomes. In contrast, ATRX did not affect the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1, showing that there are differences in the way U2OS cells respond to the presence of the herpesviral genomes.	0
22400990	Adsorption of sulfur dioxide by CoFe2O4 spinel ferrite nanoparticles and corresponding changes in magnetism. Adsorption of sulfur dioxide on 10 nm CoFe(2)O(4) spinel ferrite nanoparticles was examined. Adsorption loadings of sulfur dioxide at breakthrough conditions were determined to be approximately 0.62 mol/kg, which is significant given the 150 m(2)/g surface area of the nanoparticles. Adsorption proceeds through a chemisorption mechanism with sulfur dioxide forming a sulfate upon adsorption on the particle surface, which leads to a 23% decrease in the remnant magnetization, a 20% decrease in the saturation magnetization, and a 9% decrease in the coercivity of the magnetic nanoparticles. Adsorbent materials that provide a magnetic signal when adsorption occurs could have broad implications on adsorption-based separations.	0
21778826	Root architecture remodeling induced by phosphate starvation. Plants have evolved efficient strategies for utilizing nutrients in the soil in order to survive, grow, and reproduce. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is a major macroelement source for plant growth; however, the availability and distribution of Pi are varying widely across locations. Thus, plants in many areas experience Pi deficiency. To maintain cellular Pi homeostasis, plants have developed a series of adaptive responses to facilitate external Pi acquisition, limit Pi consumption, and adjust Pi recycling internally under Pi starvation conditions. This review focuses on the molecular regulators that modulate Pi starvation-induced root architectural changes.	0

15644161	[Effects of Corydalis ambailis migo total alkaloids on experimental cerebral ischemia]. OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effects of Corydalis ambailis migo total alkaloids (COAMTA) on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats and to investigate its mechanism. METHODS: The effects of COAMTA on decapitated gasping mouse model and rat model of middle cerebral artery ischemia (2 h)/reperfusion (22 h) were observed. The neurological scale, cerebral infarcted volume and cerebral water content subjected to cerebral middle artery ischemia/reperfusion in rats were recorded. The activities of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the ratso brain were measured. Cell apoptosis in ischemic penumbral area was observed with light microscope in the method of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: The average gasping time of the mice (6.0 mg/kg or 9.0 mg/kg COAMTA) was significantly prolonged, the cerebral infarcted volume and cerebral water content of the rats (5.0 mg/kg or 7.5 mg/kg COAMTA) were significantly decreased, as compared with the control groups. The average activity of SOD in cerebral tissue of the rats (5.0 mg/kg or 7.5 mg/kg COAMTA) was significantly higher than that of the control groups, meanwhile, the average activity of NOS and the content of MDA declined significantly. The cell apoptosis in ischemic penumbral area of the rats (5.0 mg/kg COAMTA) was significantly inhibited as compared with the control groups. CONCLUSION: COAMTA can facilitate the protection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion damage. The mechanism is related to inhibiting the activity of NOS and lipoperoxidation, increasing the activity of SOD and decreasing the neuronal apoptosis.	0
7958146	Plasma levels of beta-endorphin and ACTH during labor and immediate puerperium. We measured concentrations of beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in maternal peripheral plasma during dilation, the expulsive period and immediate puerperium, and in the umbilical vein. Plasma levels of both peptides increased markedly and were directly correlated during labor, and decreased 24 h after birth; they were no longer correlated during immediate puerperium. In the umbilical vein, beta-EP and ACTH were also directly correlated. Moreover, the concentration of each of the two peptides in maternal plasma during the expulsive period was correlated with the corresponding concentration in umbilical vein. We discuss the importance of placental corticotropin-releasing factor in the regulation of maternal and fetal stress.	0

10121962	The provision of secure psychiatric services in Leeds; Paper i. A point prevalence study. The results of a point prevalence study were used to assess the relative contributions of a local Special Care Unit, Regional Secure Unit and Special Hospitals to the provision of secure psychiatric services in Leeds. Over a six-month period, a comparison was undertaken of all patients admitted to the three tiers of security; particular emphasis was given to mentally abnormal offenders. Most admissions to the Special Care Unit were transferred from the general psychiatric wards; admissions to the Regional Secure Unit were mainly from the Court and prisons. On the census day, 7.1 patients per 100,000 population from the catchment area were in one of the three tiers of security, with the Special Hospitals providing the main long-stay service component. The findings show that the three tiers perform distinct, but complementary, functions, and emphasise a need for medium to long-stay secure facilities.	0
12483798	Pesticide illness, farm practices, and neurological symptoms among farm residents in Colorado. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between pesticides and neurological symptoms among a population exposed to organophosphate chemicals as a result of agricultural use. Chronic sequelae of acute pesticide poisoning from organophosphate compounds include a variety of neurological symptoms including restlessness, irritability, and trouble sleeping. Individuals who have had an acute pesticide poisoning have been reported to suffer a wide range of neurological symptoms that occur from weeks to months after the initial episode. Data for this study came from a cross-sectional survey of farmers and their spouses conducted in an eight-county area in north-eastern Colorado. Neurological characteristics were assessed to determine their relationship with previously reported pesticide-related illnesses. Symptoms that were significantly associated with a previous poisoning were difficulty concentrating [OR 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22, 3.50]; relatives noticing person had trouble remembering things (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.47, 4.39); making notes to remember things (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.20, 3.97); finding it hard to understand the meaning of newspapers, magazines, and books (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.01, 3.60); felt irritable (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.08, 3.12); felt depressed (OR 2.82, 95% CI 1.65, 4.81); had heart palpitations without exertion (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.22, 6.54); sleeping more than usual (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.95, 6.58); difficulty moving fingers or grasping things (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.06, 3.24); and headaches at least once a week (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.06, 3.24). Stepwise regression was used to identify the best explanatory model of pesticide-related illness. Variables that were associated with increased odds of illness were being male, being depressed, sleeping too much, and using crop organophosphates.	0

24091359	Model-based iterative reconstruction: effect on patient radiation dose and image quality in pediatric body CT. PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare image quality and radiation dose between a reduced-dose computed tomographic (CT) protocol that uses model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and a standard-dose CT protocol that uses 30% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) with filtered back projection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained. Clinical CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis obtained with a reduced-dose protocol were identified. Images were reconstructed with two algorithms: MBIR and 100% ASIR. All subjects had undergone standard-dose CT within the prior year, and the images were reconstructed with 30% ASIR. Reduced- and standard-dose images were evaluated objectively and subjectively. Reduced-dose images were evaluated for lesion detectability. Spatial resolution was assessed in a phantom. Radiation dose was estimated by using volumetric CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) and calculated size-specific dose estimates (SSDE). A combination of descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and t tests was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In the 25 patients who underwent the reduced-dose protocol, mean decrease in CTDI(vol) was 46% (range, 19%-65%) and mean decrease in SSDE was 44% (range, 19%-64%). Reduced-dose MBIR images had less noise (P > .004). Spatial resolution was superior for reduced-dose MBIR images. Reduced-dose MBIR images were equivalent to standard-dose images for lungs and soft tissues (P > .05) but were inferior for bones (P = .004). Reduced-dose 100% ASIR images were inferior for soft tissues (P < .002), lungs (P < .001), and bones (P < .001). By using the same reduced-dose acquisition, lesion detectability was better (38% [32 of 84 rated lesions]) or the same (62% [52 of 84 rated lesions]) with MBIR as compared with 100% ASIR.

Reduction of cellular polyamine pools results in inhibition of cell proliferation and sometimes in induction of cell death. Reduction of cellular polyamine pools can be achieved by several strategies involving all the mechanisms of polyamine homoeostasis, i.e. biosynthesis, catabolism and transport across the cell membrane. In the present paper, we concentrate on results achieved using the polyamine analogue DENSPM (N(1),N(11)-diethylnorspermine) on different cell lines. We discuss polyamine levels in DENSPM-treated cells in relation to effects on cell cycle kinetics and induction of apoptosis. To really understand the role of polyamines in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, we believe it is now time to go through the vast polyamine literature in a meta-analysis-based manner. This short review does not claim to be such a study, but it is our hope to stimulate such studies in the polyamine field. Such work is especially important from the viewpoint of introducing drugs that affect polyamine homoeostasis in the treatment of various diseases such as cancer.	0
9395215	Inhibition of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline-DNA adducts by indole-3-carbinol: dose-response studies in the rat colon. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) inhibits the formation of colonic aberrant crypt foci and DNA adducts in rats given heterocyclic amine colon carcinogens, such as 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ). Mechanism studies indicate that I3C induces cytochromes P4501A1 and 1A2 (CYP1A1 and CYP1A2), isozymes that respectively metabolize IQ via ring hydroxylation or activate the carcinogen by N-hydroxylation. The present study examined the dose-response for induction of CYP1A1 versus CYP1A2 by I3C, and compared the profiles of induction with the dose-response for inhibition of IQ-DNA adducts in the colon of the F344 rat. Dietary equivalent doses of I3C in the range 100-1000 p.p.m. increased in a dose-related manner both ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and methoxyresorufin O-demethylase (MROD) activities in the liver and colonic mucosa, and Western blots showed a corresponding induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 proteins. However, dietary equivalent doses of I3C in the range 10-25 p.p.m. (i) reduced hepatic EROD and MROD activities and CYP1A protein levels compared with controls, (ii) increased the ratio of CYP1A2 versus CYP1A1, and (iii) activated IQ to a more potent mutagen when liver microsomes from rats given I3C were used for metabolic activation in the Salmonella assay. Rats given a single oral dose of I3C shortly before administering IQ (5 mg/kg body wt, p.o.) exhibited dose-related inhibition of colonic IQ-DNA adducts in the range 25-100 p.p.m. I3C, reaching 95% inhibition at doses > or = 100 p.p.m. I3C, but IQ-DNA adducts were elevated slightly at the lowest I3C dose as compared with the controls. The possible significance of the low versus high dose effects of I3C are discussed in the context of human dietary exposures to I3C and the reported chemopreventive mechanisms of I3C in vivo.	0

8098560	[Changes in free radicals and possibility of their correction in patients with bronchial asthma]. The controversy of data about the role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma (BA) and lack of clear recommendations for the use of medicaments with antioxidant characteristics in the treatment of patients with BA has challenged us to undertake this study. The aim was to explain characteristics of generation of active forms of oxygen (AFO) by leukocytes, peroxide lipid oxidation (PLO) and antiperoxide plasma activities (APA) in patients with BA, evaluation of their pathogenetic importance and justified use of antioxidants in the complex therapy of BA. For this purpose, 92 patients with BA and 45 healthy volunteers were studied. Generation of AFO by blood leukocytes were examined by the method of luminol-dependent chemiluminiscence (CL). Basal and stimulated HL parameters have been measured. The intensity of PLO was determined according to the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) in plasma. The APA was determined according to its resistance to the injection of free radicals oxidation of hydrogen peroxide. In patients with acute BA compared with healthy volunteers, both CL parameters were increased. In the same time the contents of plasma MDA and relationship of induced and spontaneous plasma CL were increased which suggested the decreased APA. In remission, both CL parameters of AFK generation by leukocytes and the contents of plasma MDA were decreased approximating the normal, but it was never reached. The direct proportional dependence of the degree of impairment and severity of the BA course and the intensity of free radical process were discovered as well as the reversed proportional dependence among the degree of impairment and severity of BA and plasma APA. However, the least parameters of AFK generation by leukocytes were obtained in patients with asthmatic state. In patients with steroid-dependent bronchial asthma the free radical process is more intensive, the plasma APA being lower than in patients with steroid-non-dependent bronchial asthma. Regarding the free radical process the most responsive was aspirin asthma, the mildest exercise-induced asthma. In patients with steroid-non-dependent BA and in patients with steroid-dependent BA who together with the traditional therapy received also antioxidants (aevit and glutamic acid), the decreased CL parameters of leukocyte AFK generation and the decreased contents of MDA were more manifested than in patients not taking antioxidants.	0

17097660	Statin treatment for children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis. AIMS: To assess efficacy and safety of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment in children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE and Current Controlled Trials databases were searched. Study design, efficacy, and safety outcome-measures were extracted. Results of parallel-group randomised placebo controlled trials with low density (LDL) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglycerides as outcomes were pooled using standard meta-analytical methods. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty seven of 1060 identified papers studied familial hypercholesterolaemia, and 18 papers reported 7 prospective case series, 1 non-randomised trial, 2 trials with active treatment control groups, and 8 parallel-group randomised placebo controlled trials (RCT). The RCTs randomised 947 children, aged 8-18 years, for periods of 6-96 weeks with an estimated 850 person-years follow-up. There were no differences in clinical or laboratory adverse reactions between placebo and active treatment. Statins lowered LDL 32.5% (95% CI 24.3, 40.7), increased HDL 3.4% (0.8, 6.0), lowered triglycerides 3.0% (-11.6, 17.6), attenuated progression of carotid medial thickness, and improved endothelial function. CONCLUSIONS: Statin monotherapy is efficacious, well tolerated and safe in the short-term, although long-term safety remains unclear. Current evidence supports treatment of children at highest cardiovascular risk, but results of on-going, longer-term studies may extend these indications.	0

23738524	Monofunctional and higher-valent platinum anticancer agents. Platinum compounds represent one of the great success stories of metals in medicine. Following the serendipitous discovery of the anticancer activity of cisplatin by Rosenberg, a large number of cisplatin variants have been prepared and tested for their ability to kill cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth. These efforts continue today with increased realization that new strategies are needed to overcome issues of toxicity and resistance inherent to treatment by the approved platinum anticancer agents. One approach has been the use of so-called \"non-traditional\" platinum(II) and platinum(IV) compounds that violate the structure-activity relationships that governed platinum drug-development research for many years. Another is the use of specialized drug-delivery strategies. Here we describe recent developments from our laboratory involving monofunctional platinum(II) complexes together with a historical account of the manner by which we came to investigate these compounds and their relationship to previously studied molecules. We also discuss work carried out using platinum(IV) prodrugs and the development of nanoconstructs designed to deliver them in vivo.	0

16757426	New strategies in chronic myeloid leukemia. Most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) achieve clinically relevant hematologic and cytogenetic responses to imatinib. Patients who show resistance to imatinib need new therapeutic options. A range of options are being developed to treat imatinib-resistant patients who have CML. Promising results of early-phase clinical trials have been reported for new tyrosine kinase inhibitors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, decitabine, homoharringtonine, and vaccines. Further clinical trials are needed to characterize the efficacy and safety profile of these new agents and to determine which agents improve the long-term prognosis for patients with CML who have shown resistance to imatinib.	0
21382088	Immediate loading after implant placement following tooth extraction up-regulates cellular activity in the dog mandible. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate cellular activity of the cervical portion of peri-implant tissue due to immediate loading after implant placement following tooth extraction from the dog mandible, in terms of morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sand-blasted implant was inserted into the root septum bone of each extraction socket and was connected to a superstructure made from resin and then covered with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. Implants without the superstructure were used as the non-loading control group. Animals were sacrificed 1-3 weeks later and specimens were observed using light microscopy and mRNA levels were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The new bone formation ratio in the loading group at 3 weeks was significantly higher than in the non-loading group. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-positive cells were observed in tissues around the implant surface in both groups at each of the time periods. More osteocalcin (OCN)-positive cells were observed in the non-loading group than in the loading group at 2 weeks. The expression of ALP mRNA in the loading group was significantly up-regulated compared with the non-loading group (P<0.05). The expression of OCN mRNA in the loading group was significantly up-regulated compared with the non-loading group at 2 weeks (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that immediate loading after implant placement following tooth extraction osteogenic affects cellular activity of cervical portion of peri-implant tissue.	0
23210989	Proteomic analysis of proteins differentially expressed in conidia and mycelium of the entomopathogenic fungus Aschersonia placenta. The infection of insects by the entomopathogenic fungus Aschersonia placenta depends on conidia. To identify proteins differentially expressed in A.  placenta conidia vs mycelia, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of A.  placenta using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). We detected 1022 2-DE protein spots in conidia and 1049 in mycelia and analyzed 48 (13 from conidia and 35 from mycelia) using MALDI-TOF-MS. Finally, we identified 28 proteins (7 from conidia and 21 from mycelia). The identified proteins exclusive to conidia included major proteins participating in oxidation-reduction processes and vegetative insecticidal protein 1 (Vip1), a protein that is likely involved in pathogenicity. The identified proteins exclusive to mycelia were those involved in biosynthesis and metabolism, including uridine diphosphate galactopyranose mutase, which might play key roles in hyphal morphogenesis. This report provides the first proteomic analysis of different developmental stages of an Aschersonia species. Although only a small number of proteins were identified, the data represent a useful foundation for future studies concerning the molecular basis of entomopathogenicity in the species A.  placenta and in the genus Aschersonia.	0
6828991	Venous angiomas of the posterior fossa should be considered as anomalous venous drainage. Venous angioma of the posterior fossa has been described, and the existing literature has been reviewed. The patient presented had a venous angioma located in the pons, and both cerebellar hemispheres and was drained by an enlarged and anatomically anomalous vein within the fourth ventricle. The patient had a \"cough headache\" and later had signs of cerebellar involvement. A surgical attempt at collapsing the anomalous vein resulted in death in the immediate postoperative period due to venous infarction of the brain stem and cerebellum. Emphasis has been given to the following: 1. \"Cough Headache\" can be a presenting feature for venous angiomas of the posterior fossa. 2. Venous angiomas of the posterior fossa are developmental anatomic anomalies with enlargement of certain venous structures as a result of inadequate alternative venous drainage. 3. The enlarged vein, which is the pathognomonic feature of venous angiomas, serves a vital function in drainage of blood from structures in the posterior fossa as the usual drainage pathways are inadequate or absent. 4. Operative intervention aimed at resection or collapse of such large veins, which has been successful in treatment of venous angiomas of the frontal lobe, can be disastrous in the treatment of those lesions occurring in the posterior fossa.	0
17632313	Diagnostic value of GDx polarimetry in a Taiwan Chinese population. PURPOSE: To study the diagnostic ability of scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (GDx VCC) for early glaucomatous (EG) eyes and glaucoma-suspect (GS) eyes in a Taiwan Chinese population. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study included 82 EG eyes (mean deviation, MD: -3.32 +/- 2.20 dB), 45 GS eyes (MD: -2.43 +/- 2.16 dB), and 62 normal eyes. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness of each subject was measured using GDx VCC and Humphrey Field Analyzer visual field testing. Measured GDx VCC parameters were compared among groups. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AROC) curve of each parameter was used to differentiate normal from EG eyes or GS eyes. The correlation between MD and each parameter was also evaluated. RESULTS: For both normal versus EG and normal versus GS, the largest AROC values were for nerve fiber indicator, superior average thickness, and inferior average thickness. There was no significant correlation between MD and GDx-VCC-measured parameters either in EG or GS eyes. CONCLUSIONS: GDx VCC shows only moderate ability to distinguish normal eyes from eyes with early glaucoma. However, its diagnostic role in eyes with suspicious discs and normal visual fields is uncertain at this moment in the Taiwan Chinese population. Further studies are needed to address this issue.	0
15596310	[Routine screening of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in acute rehabilitation units]. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant bacteria among motor impaired patients admitted to an acute rehabilitation unit. METHODS: From January 2000 to December 2002, the acute rehabilitation units of R. Poincare Hospital have screened patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enterobacteria (ESBL-EB) carriage by nasal and rectal swab at admission, every month and exit. RESULTS: Finally, MRSA was isolated form screening or diagnosis samples of 360 patients and ESBL-EB from screening or diagnosis samples of 170 patients, corresponding respectively to an incidence of 3.6 for 1000 days of hospitalization (DH) and 1.7 for 1000 DH. 66% (236/360) of MRSA carriers and 58% of ESBL-EB carriers were identified only by screening samples. Carriage origin was identified for year 2002: Cases were imported for 40% (26/65) of MRSA carriers and 43% (18/42) of ESBL-EB carriers. The median acquisition delays were of 31 days [3-154] for MRSA and 19 days [3-317] for ESBL-EB. CONCLUSION: This allowed to set up contact precautions for more than 2 fold patients that would have allowed diagnosis samples alone.	0
9036454	[Interactive atlas with magnetic resonance on CD-ROM for Macintosh]. Computer assisted education in radiology has been increasingly used during the past ten years and now complements traditional learning resources. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of musculoskeletal anatomy, and particularly of joints, lends itself naturally to learning modules on computer. This paper describes the design, development and use of an interactive computer assisted teaching module of MR joint anatomy on CD-ROM for Macintosh: to date, we have used this atlas for ankle and elbow anatomy. The atlas is divided into three main sections: MR anatomy, traditional anatomy and a quiz. On each MR image, any anatomical detail can be identified clicking on it with the mouse. Buttons allow to visualize cross-reference points and to go directly on the desired image. If the student wants to look at anatomical drawings of the last identified structure, a button retrieves all the cards in the traditional anatomy section containing that structure. Finally, the student can make his own self-assessment, verifying his learning immediately with the exam mode: the software makes a random selection of 10 MR images where an anatomical structure must be indicated: if the answer is wrong, the software gives the right one and shows the misinterpreted structure. Then, the student is given a total score for his performance. The computer assisted teaching modules present some advantages: the images can be viewed in a given sequence (like traditional learning resources) or in any self-paced, customized way; this possibility, together with the friendly interface of Macintosh computers could make learning more active and pleasant.	0
18667417	Crystal structure of the deglycating enzyme fructosamine oxidase (amadoriase II). Fructosamine oxidases (FAOX) catalyze the oxidative deglycation of low molecular weight fructosamines (Amadori products). These proteins are of interest in developing an enzyme to deglycate proteins implicated in diabetic complications. We report here the crystal structures of FAOX-II from the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, in free form and in complex with the inhibitor fructosyl-thioacetate, at 1.75 and 1.6A resolution, respectively. FAOX-II is a two domain FAD-enzyme with an overall topology that is most similar to that of monomeric sarcosine oxidase. Active site residues Tyr-60, Arg-112 and Lys-368 bind the carboxylic portion of the fructosamine, whereas Glu-280 and Arg-411 bind the fructosyl portion. From structure-guided sequence comparison, Glu-280 was identified as a signature residue for FAOX activity. Two flexible surface loops become ordered upon binding of the inhibitor in a catalytic site that is about 12A deep, providing an explanation for the very low activity of FAOX enzymes toward protein-bound fructosamines, which would have difficulty accessing the active site. Structure-based mutagenesis showed that substitution of Glu-280 and Arg-411 eliminates enzyme activity. In contrast, modification of other active site residues or of amino acids in the flexible active site loops has little effect, highlighting these regions as potential targets in designing an enzyme that will accept larger substrates.	0
19362286	Prospective clinical and functional results of combined rectal and urogynecologic surgery in complex pelvic floor disorders. BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the results of combined rectal and urogynecologic surgery in women with associated obstructed defecation, urinary incontinence, or genital prolapse. METHODS: One hundred forty-two selected patients with obstructed defecation in isolation or associated with urinary incontinence, enterocele, or genital prolapse were consecutively operated on by stapled transanal rectal resection alone or associated with transobturator tape, vaginal repair of the enterocele, or vaginal hysterectomy, respectively, and followed up by clinical controls and defecography. RESULTS: At 2 years, all symptom, quality-of-life, and defecographic parameters had significantly improved in all groups (P < .001). The association with hysterectomy showed higher risk for severe complications, longer operative time, hospital stay, and time of inability (P < .001). Recurrence of urinary incontinence was observed in 3 of 24 patients, while 2 of 21 showed residual vaginal prolapse. CONCLUSION: The combination of rectal and urogynecologic surgery is effective, with higher morbidity in the association with vaginal hysterectomy. Randomized trials comparing surgery in 1 and more stages and longer follow-up are necessary for a definitive conclusion.	0
11511701	Occupation during life and risk of dementia in French elderly community residents. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether principal occupation during life is a risk factor for incident Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or dementia with parkinsonism. METHODS: This study was carried out from the PAQUID (Personnes Ag  es QUID) cohort, an epidemiological study on normal and pathological aging after 65 years in the south west of France. At baseline, 2950 non-demented people living at home were identified and re-examined 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 years later with identical standardised neurological and neuropsychological measures. Cox proportional hazards models with delayed entry were used, taking age as the time scale and adjusting for sex, education, tobacco, and wine consumption to estimate the risk ratio (RR) of incident dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and dementia with parkinsonism associated with occupational category. RESULTS: Of the 2950 subjects, 393 became demented, of whom 251 had Alzheimer's disease, 112 had vascular dementia, and 27 had dementia with parkinsonism. The risk of Alzheimer's disease was not related to a given occupation. However the risk of dementia with parkinsonism seemed to be increased in farmers in comparison with professionals and managerials, particularly among women (RR 7.47; 95%CI, 1.80-31.07). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that occupation does not change the risk of Alzheimer's disease, which seems to be more influenced by cognitive abilities in childhood and adolescence than by occupation in adult life. However, being a farmer may increase the risk of dementia with parkinsonism among women; occupation could act by the way of differences in health behaviour or in exposure to environmental factors.	0
18302014	Sensory sensitivities and performance on sensory perceptual tasks in high-functioning individuals with autism. Most reports of sensory symptoms in autism are second hand or observational, and there is little evidence of a neurological basis. Sixty individuals with high-functioning autism and 61 matched typical participants were administered a sensory questionnaire and neuropsychological tests of elementary and higher cortical sensory perception. Thirty-two percent of autism participants endorsed more sensory sensitivity items than any control participants. Both groups made few errors on elementary sensory perception items. Controls made few errors on higher cortical sensory perception items, but 30% of the autism participants made high numbers of errors. These findings support the common occurrence of sensory symptoms in high functioning autism based on first person report, and the presence of neurological abnormalities in higher cortical sensory perception.	0

In this complex, two picrate anions hydrogen bond, via their phenolate moieties, to the pendant hydroxyl groups of the receptor which, together with the four N atoms, themselves bond to Cd(II) in an approximately cubic arrangement. One picrate anion hydrogen bonds to all four hydroxyl groups, one of which also acts as the sole hydrogen-bond donor to the second picrate anion.	0
15972547	Genome scale identification of Treponema pallidum antigens. Antibody responses for 882 of the 1,039 proteins in the proteome of Treponema pallidum were examined. Sera collected from infected rabbits were used to systematically identify 106 antigenic proteins, including 22 previously identified antigens and 84 novel antigens. Additionally, sera collected from rabbits throughout the course of infection demonstrated a progression in the breadth and intensity of humoral immunoreactivity against a representative panel of T. pallidum antigens.	0
18647716	Differential reproductive success favours strong host preference in a highly specialized brood parasite. Obligate avian brood parasites show dramatic variation in the degree to which they are host specialists or host generalists. The screaming cowbird Molothrus rufoaxillaris is one of the most specialized brood parasites, using a single host, the bay-winged cowbird (Agelaioides badius) over most of its range. Coevolutionary theory predicts increasing host specificity the longer the parasite interacts with a particular avian community, as hosts evolve defences that the parasite cannot counteract. According to this view, host specificity can be maintained if screaming cowbirds avoid parasitizing potentially suitable hosts that have developed effective defences against parasitic females or eggs. Specialization may also be favoured, even in the absence of host defences, if the parasite's reproductive success in alternative hosts is lower than that in the main host. We experimentally tested these hypotheses using as alternative hosts two suitable but unparasitized species: house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and chalk-browed mockingbirds (Mimus saturninus). We assessed host defences against parasitic females and eggs, and reproductive success of the parasite in current and alternative hosts. Alternative hosts did not discriminate against screaming cowbird females or eggs. Egg survival and hatching success were similarly high in current and alternative hosts, but the survival of parasitic chicks was significantly lower in alternative hosts. Our results indicate that screaming cowbirds have the potential to colonize novel hosts, but higher reproductive success in the current host may favour host fidelity.	0

12076958	Preconditioning-mediated neuroprotection: role of nitric oxide, cGMP, and new protein expression. Preconditioning adaptation induced by transient ischemia can increase brain tolerance to oxidative stress, but the underlying neuroprotective mechanisms are not fully understood. Recently, we developed a human brain-derived cell model to investigate preconditioning mechanism in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.(1) Our results demonstrate that a non-lethal serum deprivation-stress for 2 h (preconditioning stress) enhanced the tolerance to a subsequent lethal oxidative stress (24 h serum deprivation) and also to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP(+)).(2) Two-hour non-lethal preconditioning stress increased the expression of neuronal nitric oxide (NOS1/nNOS) mRNA, Fos, Ref-1, NOS protein, and then nitric oxide (*NO) production. As well as MnSOD expression, the *NO-cGMP-PKG pathway mediated the preconditioning-induced upregulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the downregulation of adaptor protein p66(shc). We also propose that cGMP-mediated preconditioning-induced adaptation against oxidative stress may be due to the synthesis of a new protein, such as thioredoxin (Trx) since the protective effect can be blocked by Trx reductase inhibitor.(3) The antioxidative potency of Trx was approximately 100 and 1,000 times greater than GSNO and GSH, respectively. These results suggest that *NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway plays an important role in the preconditioning-induced neuroprotection, and perhaps cardioprotection, against oxidative stress.	0

23090459	Postoperative infections in obstetrics and gynecology. Postoperative infection is the most commonly seen complication of surgery in obstetrics and gynecology. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis has greatly decreased though not completely eliminated this adverse outcome. Postoperative infections include wound cellulitis, wound abscess, endomyometritis, pelvic cellulitis, and pelvic abscess. Infections usually manifest as fever and greater than normal postoperative pain. Refractory fevers maybe because of septic pelvic vein thrombophlebitis or maybe noninfectious in origin. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as soon as possible when diagnosis of postoperative infection is made; most patients will respond to treatment within 24 to 48 hours when appropriate antibiotics are selected.	0
20650248	In vitro effect of n-nitrosodiethylamine on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system in human erythrocytes. Human erythrocytes were used in vitro to investigate the effect of the hepatocarcinogen N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) on lipid peroxidation (LPO) and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR). LPO and erythrocyte haemolysis increased with increasing concentrations of NDEA and with increased exposure time. CAT activity decreased while GR activity increased with both the increasing concentrations of NDEA treatment and exposure time. However, no alteration was observed in SOD enzyme activity. The inhibitory effects of antioxidants and free radical scavengers such as EDTA, succinic acid, sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid were observed. These agents lowered NDEA-induced LPO and haemolysis in erythrocytes. This might indicate that the generation of free radicals and subsequent LPO may play a role, at least in part, in inducing NDEA toxicity.	0
19542304	Treatment of cartilage defects in the knee using alginate beads containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes. BACKGROUND: The repair of osteochondral lesions is imperfect and transient; chondral lesions do not heal in mature cartilage. Attempts have been made to restore cartilage lesions by filling the defects with a temporary artificial biocompatible matrix. PURPOSE: To determine whether the implantation of alginate beads containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes is feasible and safe for the treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects in the knee. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A biodegradable, alginate-based, biocompatible scaffold containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes was used for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral lesions in the knee. Twenty-one patients were clinically and prospectively evaluated with use of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and a visual analog scale for pain preoperatively and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up. Of the 21 patients, 13 consented to having a biopsy sample taken for investigative purposes from the area of implantation at 12 months of follow-up, allowing histologic assessment of the repair tissue. RESULTS: A statistically significant clinical improvement became apparent after 6 months, and patients improved during the 24 months of follow-up. Adverse reactions to the alginate/fibrin matrix seeded with the allogenic cartilage cells were not observed. Histologic analysis of the biopsy specimens rated the repair tissue as hyaline-like in 15.3% of the samples, as mixed tissue in 46.2%, as fibrocartilage in 30.8%, and as fibrous in 7.7%. CONCLUSION: The results of this short-term pilot study show that the alginate-based scaffold containing human mature allogenic chondrocytes is feasible and safe for the treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee. The described technique provides clinical and histologic outcomes that are equal but not superior to those of other cartilage repair techniques.	0

The role played by low molecular weight emulsifiers (mono- and di-glycerides) and non-dairy stabilizers (alginates, carrageenans, gums and gelatins) in the formation and stabilization of liquid milk (and specifically a functionalized milk containing omega-3), yoghurt and ice cream has been reviewed. Attention is given to the interactions that may occur between the reactive sites on polysaccharide stabilizers and milk proteins and other milk components, and to the desirable characteristics, e.g., viscosity/consistency, appearance and mouthfeel, body and texture, imparted to yoghurt and ice cream by addition of emulsifiers and gums.	0
19634113	E-cadherin and metalloproteinase-1 and -7 polymorphisms in colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: E-cadherin (CDH1) and metalloproteinase (MMP) polymorphisms could play a crucial role in cancer invasion. Our aim was to investigate the influence of the -160C/A CDH1, -1607ins/delG MMP-1 and -181A/G MMP-7 polymorphisms on the frequency and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 130 patients with CRC and 130 noncancer controls were studied. The -160C/A CDH1, -1607ins/delG MMP-1 and -181A/G MMP-7 genotypes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Patients with the 1G allele and a family history of CRC showed a six times higher risk of developing CRC (OR: 6.45, 95% CI: 2.02-20.6, p=0.001). The A/A CDH1 genotype was associated with a higher risk of metastatic disease (OR: 3.43, 95% CI: 1.27-9.27, p=0.023). A higher marginal risk of metastatic disease was observed for MMP-1 genotypes 1G/1G and 1G/2G (OR: 2.97, 95% CI: 0.93-9.47, p=0.098). CONCLUSIONS: The -160C/A CDH1, -1607ins/delG MMP-1 and -181A/G MMP-7 single nucleotide polymorphisms did not modify the risk of CRC development. Patients with the 1G/1G or 1G/2G genotype and a family history of CRC presented a higher risk of CRC. The AA CDH1 and 1G/1G and 1G/2G MMP-1 genotypes might be associated with advanced metastatic disease, but are not markers of lymphatic metastasis.	0
16618812	JNK1 phosphorylation of SCG10 determines microtubule dynamics and axodendritic length. c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) are essential during brain development, when they regulate morphogenic changes involving cell movement and migration. In the adult, JNK determines neuronal cytoarchitecture. To help uncover the molecular effectors for JNKs in these events, we affinity purified JNK-interacting proteins from brain. This revealed that the stathmin family microtubule-destabilizing proteins SCG10, SCLIP, RB3, and RB3' interact tightly with JNK. Furthermore, SCG10 is also phosphorylated by JNK in vivo on sites that regulate its microtubule depolymerizing activity, serines 62 and 73. SCG10-S73 phosphorylation is significantly decreased in JNK1-/- cortex, indicating that JNK1 phosphorylates SCG10 in developing forebrain. JNK phosphorylation of SCG10 determines axodendritic length in cerebrocortical cultures, and JNK site-phosphorylated SCG10 colocalizes with active JNK in embryonic brain regions undergoing neurite elongation and migration. We demonstrate that inhibition of cytoplasmic JNK and expression of SCG10-62A/73A both inhibited fluorescent tubulin recovery after photobleaching. These data suggest that JNK1 is responsible for regulation of SCG10 depolymerizing activity and neurite elongation during brain development.	0

6827633	Neuroma formation following digital amputations. One hundred consecutive patients with 144 digital amputations performed at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center between 1978 and 1980 were retrospectively reviewed. In this group, four patients demonstrated painful amputation stumps. Two of these were treated by surgical excision of neuromas and two patients, who had more vague complaints, were treated by desensitization which decreased the sensitivity of their stumps and allowed them to return to work. It is felt that this low incidence of painful neuromas and amputation stumps is due to the positive postoperative effort to send patients back to work as soon as possible, allowing them to perform their own therapy and thereby minimizing their disability and tendency to develop pain problems.	0

22296727	Up-regulation of platelet-activating factor synthases and its receptor in spinal cord contribute to development of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. BACKGROUND: Platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a lipid mediator derived from cell membrane. It has been reported that PAF is involved in various pathological conditions, such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain and intrathecal administration of PAF leads to tactile allodynia. However, the expression of PAF synthases and its receptor in the spinal cord following peripheral nerve injury is unknown. METHODS: Using the rat spared nerve injury (SNI) model, we investigated the expression of PAF synthases (LPCAT1 and 2) and PAF receptor (PAFr) mRNAs in the spinal cord. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and double-labeling analysis of in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) with immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed for the analyses. Pain behaviors were also examined with PAFr antagonist (WEB2086). RESULTS: RT-PCR showed that LPCAT2 mRNA was increased in the ipsilateral spinal cord after injury, but not LPCAT1 mRNA. Double-labeling of ISHH with IHC revealed that LPCAT1 and 2 mRNAs were constitutively expressed by a subset of neurons, and LPCAT2 mRNA was increased in spinal microglia after nerve injury. RT-PCR showed that PAFr mRNA was dramatically increased in the ipsilateral spinal cord after nerve injury. Double-labeling analysis of ISHH with IHC revealed that after injury PAFr mRNA was predominantly colocalized with microglia in the spinal cord. Continuous intrathecal administration of the PAFr antagonist suppressed mechanical allodynia following peripheral nerve injury. Delayed administration of a PAFr antagonist did not reverse the mechanical allodynia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show the histological localization of PAF synthases and its receptor in the spinal cord following peripheral nerve injury, and suggest that PAF/PAFr signaling in the spinal cord acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner among the activated microglia and neurons, thus contributing to development of neuropathic pain.	0
8611611	Contribution to the biophysics of the lethal effects of electric field on microorganisms. The proposed model assumes that the criteria leading to the lethal breakdown of microorganisms suspended in a continuous medium depend on two parameters: (a) the applied electric field must exceed the critical field of membrane to create holes and (b) the Joule energy (deposited in the membrane) must exceed the minimum value beyond which the cell can not recover. The first parameter initiates (reversible) breakdown and the second one, the completion of the (irreversible) electrical breakdown leading to death of the cell. The number of cells surviving the electric field treatment is related to statistical distribution of cell size. Comparison between theory and the experimental results of Kinosita and Tsong (1977); H  lsheger et al. (1980, 1981, 1983); Rosemberg and Korenstein (1990) and others is given.	0
17317154	Involvement of gene polymorphisms of thymidylate synthase in gene expression, protein activity and anticancer drug cytotoxicity using the NCI-60 panel. A significant association has been established, in clinical studies, between the expression or activity of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and the efficiency of fluorouracil. TYMS expression is partly under the dependence of gene polymorphisms in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR), but conflicting results have been obtained about their roles on fluorouracil efficiency. In this study, we wanted to use the National Cancer Institute (NCI) panel of 60 human tumour cell lines to clarify this problem. Three relevant polymorphisms of the TYMS gene were studied: (i) the 5'UTR tandem repeat of 28-bp (2R/3R polymorphism); (ii) the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the second repeat (3C/3G polymorphism); (iii) the 3'UTR 6-bp deletion (+6/-6 polymorphism). Allele frequencies were close to those expected in a Caucasian population (2R/3C/3G: 53/29/18%; +6/-6: 68/32%), but the proportion of heterozygous genotypes was lower than expected from allele frequencies. The 2R and 3G alleles were significantly associated with the +6 and the -6 alleles, respectively. There was a significant association between the presence of the 3G allele and TYMS mRNA expression and catalytic activity, particularly in p53-mutated cell lines. However, no significant correlation existed between fluorouracil cytotoxicity, as extracted from the NCI databases, and TYMS expression, activity or polymorphisms.	0
23418729	Serotonin promotes the proliferation of serum-deprived hepatocellular carcinoma cells via upregulation of FOXO3a. BACKGROUND: Peripheral serotonin is involved in tumorigenesis and induces a pro-proliferative effect in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells; however, the intracellular mechanisms by which serotonin exerts a mitogenic effect remain unclear. In this research, we examined whether FOXO3a, a transcription factor at the interface of crucial cellular processes, plays a role downstream of serotonin in HCC cells. RESULTS: The cell viability and expression of FOXO3a was assessed in three HCC cell lines (Huh7, HepG2 and Hep3B) during serum deprivation in the presence or absence of serotonin. Serum free media significantly inhibited HCC proliferation and led to reduced expression and nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a. Knockdown of FOXO3a enhanced the ability of serum deprivation to inhibit HCC cells proliferation. And overexpression of non-phosphorylated FOXO3a in HCC cells reversed serum-deprivation-induced growth inhibition. Serotonin reversed the serum-deprivation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and upregulated FOXO3a in Huh7 cells; however, serotonin had no effect on the proliferation of serum-deprived HepG2 or Hep3B cells. In addition to proliferation, serotonin also induced phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO3a in serum-deprived Huh7 cells but not in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. However, the phosphorylation of FOXO3a induced by serotonin did not export FOXO3a from nucleus to cytoplasm in serum-deprived Huh7 cells. Consequently, we demonstrated that serotonin promoted the proliferation of Huh7 cells by increasing the expression of FOXO3a. We also provide preliminary evidence that different expression levels of the 5-HT2B receptor (5-HT2BR) may contribute to the distinct effects of serotonin in different serum-deprived HCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that FOXO3a functions as a growth factor in serum-deprived HCC cells and serotonin promotes the proliferation of serum-deprived HCC cells via upregulation of FOXO3a, in the presence of sufficient levels of the serotonin receptor 5-HT2BR. Drugs targeting the serotonin-5-HT2BR-FOXO3a pathway may provide a novel target for anticancer therapy.	0

19733123	Endometriosis, in vitro fertilisation and the risk of gynaecological malignancies, including ovarian and breast cancer. There is evidence that endometriosis as well as drugs used in the process of in vitro fertilisation appear to associate with increased risk for gynaecological cancer. In this review, we attempt to describe this relationship according to the most recent epidemiologic data and to present the possible mechanisms on the molecular level that could potentially explain this correlation. There are data to support that ovarian endometriosis could have the potential for malignant transformation. Epidemiologic and genetic studies support this notion. It seems that endometriosis is associated with specific types of ovarian cancer (endometrioid and clear cell). There is no clear association between endometriosis and breast or endometrial cancer. More studies are needed to establish the risk factors that may lead to malignant transformation of this condition and to identify predisposed individuals who may require closer surveillance. Currently, there is no proven relationship between any type of gynaecological cancer and drugs used for infertility treatment. In principle, infertile women have increased risk for gynaecologic malignancies. Nulligravidas who received treatment are at increased risk for malignancy compared with women who had conceived after treatment. There is limited evidence that clomiphene citrate use for more than six cycles or 900mg or treatment of women over the age of 40 could increase their risk for ovarian and breast cancer. More studies with the appropriate statistical power and follow-up time are required to evaluate accurately the long-term effects of these drugs and procedures.	0

11223672	Expression and prognostic value of CD44 standard and variant v3 and v6 isoforms in prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: The adhesion molecule CD44 standard (CD44s), and its variant isoforms v3 and v6 are associated with cell-to-cell adhesion. The down-regulation of CD44 standard and its variant isoform CD44v6 is linked with early cancer cell dissemination, but the relationship between CD44v3 and malignant features of prostate cancer (PC) has not been established previously. METHODS: The expression of CD44s and its CD44v3 and CD44v6 isoforms was analysed by immunohistochemistry in 209 archival PC biopsy specimens to establish their prognostic value. RESULTS: Down-regulation of CD44s and CD44v6 was related to high T classification, metastasis, high Gleason score, DNA aneuploidy, high S-phase fraction, high mitotic index, perineural growth and dense amount of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (p < 0.03 for all). Down-regulation of CD44s and CD44v6 was related to poor survival in the entire cohort (p < 0.0001), in M0 tumours (p < 0.001) and in T1-2M0 tumours (p < 0.05). In needle biopsies and TURP specimens, the prognostic impact of the investigated parameters was similar. In the multivariate analysis, T classification (p = 0.0009), presence of metastases (p < 0.0001), Gleason score (p = 0.0060) and CD44v6 (p = 0.0220) expression were independent prognostic factors. In M0 tumours, T classification (p < 0.0001) and CD44v6 (p = 0.003) independently predicted survival. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of CD44s and its CD44v6 isoform is related to tumour malignancy and unfavourable prognosis in PC.	0
7983348	Utility of the hospital tuberculosis registry. Emerging guidelines suggest that the management of tuberculosis and suspected tuberculosis in the hospital will become an increasingly costly enterprise. The local hospital registry can be a focal point for determining the extent to which such measures are necessary at individual institutions, that existing infection control recommendations are being carried out, and that patients released from the hospital are not lost to follow-up. Consideration might be given to inclusion of all patients begun on antituberculous therapy, regardless of the results of acid-fast bacilli cultures, in view of renewed concern about patient compliance.	0
8648031	Establishment and characterization of alpha s1-casein-specific T-cell lines from patients allergic to cow's milk: unexpected higher frequency of CD8+ T-cell lines. To study cow's milk allergy at the cellular level, we assessed the reactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients allergic to cow's milk to alpha s1-casein, which is one of the major allergens in cow's milk. Proliferation of the cells to alpha s1-casein activation showed a rather weak response. Therefore to understand T-cell reactivity to alpha s1-casein in more detail, we prepared alpha s1-casein-specific T-cell lines from patients allergic to cow's milk and established 26 T-cell lines. These T-cell lines could be classified into three groups by analyzing their surface marker expression: those containing predominantly CD4+ CD8- T cells, those containing both CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ T cells, and those containing predominantly CD4- CD8+ T cells. The CD8+ T cells were obtained at an unexpectedly higher frequency from the patients. These T-cell lines produced interferon-gamma and IL-4. These results suggest that CD8+ T cells specific for alpha s1-casein and CD4+ T cells were primed by the stimulation with alpha s1-casein in patients allergic to milk and that both T cells may play a key role in the onset, progression of, or recovery from cow's milk allergy.	0
12480320	Development and assessment of mini projectiles as drug carriers. This paper describes a novel technology for the delivery of drugs into the subcutaneous and intramuscular tissue of farmed animals. The technology comprises small, hollow mini projectiles into which drug formulations can be loaded and administered using compressed air from an administration device which is held a few millimeters (3-10 mm) from the surface of the animals' skin. The design of the mini projectiles and administration procedure allows administration without contacting the skin, thereby avoiding cross-contamination between handlings and ensuring safe injection practice in livestock. In vitro experiments are described which investigate the parameters that affect mini projectile penetration into excised porcine and bovine skin. These include shape and weight of the mini projectiles and species type and injection site of the animal. An in vitro skin model for assessing mini projectile administration is described which permits visualization of the penetration of the mini projectiles through excised bovine or porcine skin into an underlying tissue simulant made from gelatin. The quantities of energy necessary to inject mini projectiles through excised porcine and bovine skin into the tissue simulant of the in vitro skin model were determined. The paper also describes the processes that occur during the administration of mini projectiles. The results suggest that tissue damage caused during administration of mini projectiles is comparable to the tissue damage caused by conventional syringe-needle injections. Finally, three different formulations of the model vaccine BSA, without adjuvant, are loaded into mini projectiles and administered to pigs. A seroconversion was shown for all three formulations, thus demonstrating proof of concept for the miniprojectiles.	0

19940144	Location of 3-hydroxyproline residues in collagen types I, II, III, and V/XI implies a role in fibril supramolecular assembly. Collagen triple helices are stabilized by 4-hydroxyproline residues. No function is known for the much less common 3-hydroxyproline (3Hyp), although genetic defects inhibiting its formation cause recessive osteogenesis imperfecta. To help understand the pathogenesis, we used mass spectrometry to identify the sites and local sequence motifs of 3Hyp residues in fibril-forming collagens from normal human and bovine tissues. The results confirm a single, essentially fully occupied 3Hyp site (A1) at Pro(986) in A-clade chains alpha1(I), alpha1(II), and alpha2(V). Two partially modified sites (A2 and A3) were found at Pro(944) in alpha1(II) and alpha2(V) and Pro(707) in alpha2(I) and alpha2(V), which differed from A1 in sequence motif. Significantly, the distance between sites 2 and 3, 237 residues, is close to the collagen D-period (234 residues). A search for additional D-periodic 3Hyp sites revealed a fourth site (A4) at Pro(470) in alpha2(V), 237 residues N-terminal to site 3. In contrast, human and bovine type III collagen contained no 3Hyp at any site, despite a candidate proline residue and recognizable A1 sequence motif. A conserved histidine in mammalian alpha1(III) at A1 may have prevented 3-hydroxylation because this site in chicken type III was fully hydroxylated, and tyrosine replaced histidine. All three B-clade type V/XI collagen chains revealed the same three sites of 3Hyp but at different loci and sequence contexts from those in A-clade collagen chains. Two of these B-clade sites were spaced apart by 231 residues. From these and other observations we propose a fundamental role for 3Hyp residues in the ordered self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures.	0

21691719	Exploring the knowledge of nasopharyngeal carcinoma among medical doctors at primary health care level in Perak state, Malaysia. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is among the commonest cancers in Malaysia. The prognosis for NPC like most other head and neck cancer is dependent on its staging. Majority of patients in Malaysia at the time of diagnosis are either at stage III or IV (27 and 47%, respectively). The lack of knowledge among primary care medical doctors regarding NPC may contribute to this delay in diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of the primary care doctors in the state of Perak on the various aspects of NPC. The doctors at the primary care level in the state of Perak were recruited to take part in this study on a voluntary basis. A total number of 154 out of 198 doctors participated in this survey. They were given a questionnaire to fill in to test their knowledge on different aspects of NPC and its treatment. The overall respondents' score was poor with a score of 67.5% on all sections. The doctors appear to be able to identify common presenting features of NPC with a mean score of 85.3% but for the uncommon presentations of NPC, the scores were poorer with 61.8%. In addition, 54.1% of the participants answered that they would refer a patient with symptoms suspicious of NPC after a period of 1 month from the onset of symptom. However, only 34% would refer within 2 weeks. Based on the results of this study, the authors feel that it is clear that the doctors posted in the primary care hospitals and clinics appear to have inadequate knowledge to diagnose and refer patients with suspected NPC. As early diagnosis can often lead to a better prognostic outcome, steps must be taken to raise the awareness among these doctors.	0
20501800	Decitabine maintains hematopoietic precursor self-renewal by preventing repression of stem cell genes by a differentiation-inducing stimulus. The cytosine analogue decitabine alters hematopoietic differentiation. For example, decitabine treatment increases self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells. The mechanisms underlying decitabine-induced shifts in differentiation are poorly understood, but likely relate to the ability of decitabine to deplete the chromatin-modifying enzyme DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which plays a central role in transcription repression. HOXB4 is a transcription factor that promotes hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. In hematopoietic precursors induced to differentiate by the lineage-specifying transcription factor Pu.1 or by the cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, there is rapid repression of HOXB4 and other stem cell genes. Depletion of DNMT1 using shRNA or decitabine prevents HOXB4 repression by Pu.1 or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and maintains hematopoietic precursor self-renewal. In contrast, depletion of DNMT1 by decitabine 6 hours after the differentiation stimulus, that is, after repression of HOXB4 has occurred, augments differentiation. Therefore, DNMT1 is required for the early repression of stem cell genes, which occurs in response to a differentiation stimulus, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observation that decitabine can maintain or increase hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal in the presence of a differentiation stimulus. Using decitabine to deplete DNMT1 after this early repression phase does not impair progressive differentiation.	0
24134563	The effect of HPMC particle size on the drug release rate and the percolation threshold in extended-release mini-tablets. Abstract The particle size of HPMC is a critical factor that can influence drug release rate from hydrophilic matrix systems. Percolation theory is a statistical tool which is used to study the disorder of particles in a lattice of a sample. The percolation threshold is the point at which a component is dominant in a cluster resulting in significant changes in drug release rates. Mini-tablets are compact dosage forms of 1.5-4   mm diameter, which have potential benefits in the delivery of drug to some patient groups such as pediatrics. In this study, the effect of HPMC particle size on hydrocortisone release and its associated percolation threshold for mini-tablets and tablets was assessed. For both mini-tablets and tablets, large polymer particles reduced tensile strength, but increased the drug release rate and the percolation threshold. Upon hydration, compacts with 45-125    m HPMC particles formed a strong gel layer with low porosity, reducing hydrocortisone release rates. In comparison, faster drug release rates were obtained when 125-355     m HPMC particles were used, due to the greater pore sizes that resulted in the formation of a weaker gel. Using 125-355     m HPMC particles increased the percolation threshold for tablets and to a greater extent for mini-tablets. This work has demonstrated the importance of HPMC particle size in ER matrices, the effects of which are even more obvious for mini-tablets.	0
16523402	Natural products from cyanobacteria: Exploiting a new source for drug discovery. In the 1990s, the pharmaceutical industry shifted its focus to a combinatorial chemistry approach to fill drug-discovery pipelines; however, more recently there has been renewed interest in natural products as sources of lead compounds. Cyanobacteria are prolific producers of natural products displaying enormous chemical diversity, yet, until recently, exploitation of the genera was hampered by a number of issues related to their handling. With most of these problems now resolved, cyanobacteria have the potential to expand the variety of natural products obtained from microorganisms. The relative disregard in the past of cyanobacteria compared with other microbial sources of natural products, as well as the huge chemical diversity and biological activities of their products, recommend them as an attractive source of novel drugs for use in diverse therapeutic areas.	0
22890639	Randomised trial of clazosentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage undergoing surgical clipping (CONSCIOUS-2). We report here results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study ( http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT00558311) that investigated the effect of clazosentan (5 mg/h, n = 768) or placebo (n = 389) administered for up to 14 days in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) repaired by surgical clipping. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, new cerebral infarction or delayed ischemic neurological deficit due to vasospasm, and rescue therapy for vasospasm. The main secondary endpoint was the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), which was dichotomized. Twenty-one percent of clazosentan- compared to 25% of placebo-treated patients met the primary endpoint (relative risk reduction [RRR] [95% CI]: 17% [-4% to 33%]; p = 0.10). Poor outcome (GOSE score  <= 4) occurred in 29% of clazosentan- and 25% of placebo-treated patients (RRR: -18% [-45% to 4%]; p = 0.10). In prespecified subgroups, mortality/vasospasm-related morbidity was reduced in clazosentan-treated patients by 33% (8-51%) in poor WFNS (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons) grade (>= III) and 25% (5-41%) in patients with diffuse, thick SAH. Lung complications, anemia and hypotension occurred more frequently with clazosentan. Mortality (week 12) was 6% in both groups. The results showed that clazosentan nonsignificantly decreased mortality/vasospasm-related morbidity and nonsignificantly increased poor functional outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH undergoing surgical clipping.	0

15740324	Molecules in high spin states III: the millimeter/submillimeter-wave spectrum of the MnCl radical (X (7)Sigma(+)). The pure rotational spectrum of the MnCl radical (X (7)Sigma(+)) has been recorded in the range 141-535 GHz using millimeter-submillimeter direct absorption spectroscopy. This work is the first time the molecule has been studied with rotational resolution in its ground electronic state. MnCl was synthesized by the reaction of manganese vapor, produced in a Broida-type oven, with Cl(2). Transitions of both chlorine isotopomers were measured, as well as lines originating in several vibrationally excited states. The presence of several spin components and manganese hyperfine interactions resulted in quite complex spectra, consisting of multiple blended features. Because 42 rotational transitions were measured for Mn(35)Cl over a wide range of frequencies with high signal-to-noise, a very accurate set of rotational, fine structure, and hyperfine constants could be determined with the aid of spectral simulations. Spectroscopic constants were also determined for Mn(37)Cl and several vibrationally excited states. The values of the spin-rotation and spin-spin parameters were found to be relatively small (gamma=11.2658 MHz and lambda=1113.10 MHz for Mn(35)Cl); in the case of lambda, excited electronic states contributing to the second-order spin-orbit interaction may be canceling each other. The Fermi contact hyperfine term was found to be large in manganese chloride with b(F)(Mn(35)Cl)=397.71 MHz, a result of the manganese 4s character mixing into the 12sigma orbital. This orbital is spsigma hybridized, and contains some Mn 4psigma character, as well. Hence, it also contributes to the dipolar constant c, which is small and positive for this radical (c=32.35 MHz for Mn(35)Cl). The hyperfine parameters in MnCl are similar to those of MnH and MnF, suggesting that the bonding in these three molecules is comparable.	0
9796130	The role of sodium in the in vivo absorption of glycine by the intestine of the amphibian discoglossus pictus. This work showed that sodium deficit in the incubation medium causes a decrease in oxygen consumption of the isolated intestine. Replacement of 33% and 66% sodium by equivalent quantities of potassium provoked respective inhibitions of 43.5% and 44%. Total replacement of sodium induced an inhibition of 51.7%. Under in vivo conditions, sodium deficit in the luminal fluid led to lower glycine absorption. This inhibition was 7.9% in 5/1000 NaCl, from 16.8% in 2.5/1000 NaCl and 27.4% when sodium was totally replaced by potassium. The quantity of glycine retained by the intestinal wall in vivo was inversely proportional to sodium concentration in the intestine. We conclude from the latter result that the presence of sodium in the lumen appears to stimulate glycine transport across the basolateral membrane of the intestine.	0
19153465	Structure of relaxed-state human hemoglobin: insight into ligand uptake, transport and release. Hemoglobin was one of the first protein structures to be determined by X-ray crystallography and served as a basis for the two-state MWC model for the mechanism of allosteric proteins. Since then, there has been an ongoing debate about whether Hb allostery involves the unliganded tense T state and the liganded relaxed R state or whether it involves the T state and an ensemble of liganded relaxed states. In fact, the former model is inconsistent with many functional observations, as well as the recent discoveries of several relaxed-state Hb structures such as RR2, R3 and R2. One school of thought has suggested the R2 state to be the physiologically relevant relaxed end state, with the R state mediating the T-->R2 transition. X-ray studies have been performed on human carbonmonoxy Hb at a resolution of 2.8 A. The ensuing liganded quaternary structure is different from previously reported liganded Hb structures. The distal beta-heme pocket is the largest when compared with other liganded Hb structures, partly owing to rotation of betaHis63(E7) out of the distal pocket, creating a ligand channel to the solvent. The structure also shows unusually smaller alpha- and beta-clefts. Results from this study taken in conjunction with previous findings suggest that multiple liganded Hb states with different quaternary structures may be involved in ligand uptake, stabilization, transport and release.	0
18440594	Intrinsic hand proportions of euarchontans and other mammals: implications for the locomotor behavior of plesiadapiforms. Arboreal primates have distinctive intrinsic hand proportions compared with many other mammals. Within Euarchonta, platyrrhines and strepsirrhines have longer manual proximal phalanges relative to metacarpal length than colugos and terrestrial tree shrews. This trait is part of a complex of features allowing primates to grasp small-diameter arboreal substrates. In addition to many living and Eocene primates, relative elongation of proximal manual phalanges is also present in most plesiadapiforms. In order to evaluate the functional and evolutionary implications of manual similarities between crown primates and plesiadapiforms, we measured the lengths of the metacarpal, proximal phalanx, and intermediate phalanx of manual ray III for 132 extant mammal species (n=702 individuals). These data were compared with measurements of hands in six plesiadapiform species using ternary diagrams and phalangeal indices. Our analyses reveal that many arboreal mammals (including some tree shrews, rodents, marsupials, and carnivorans) have manual ray III proportions similar to those of various arboreal primates. By contrast, terrestrial tree shrews have hand proportions most similar to those of other terrestrial mammals, and colugos are highly derived in having relatively long intermediate phalanges. Phalangeal indices of arboreal species are significantly greater than those of the terrestrial species in our sample, reflecting the utility of having relatively long digits in an arboreal context. Although mammals known to be capable of prehensile grips demonstrate long digits relative to palm length, this feature is not uniquely associated with manual prehension and should be interpreted with caution in fossil taxa. Among plesiadapiforms, Carpolestes, Nannodectes, Ignacius, and Dryomomys have manual ray III proportions that are unlike those of most terrestrial species and most similar to those of various arboreal species of primates, tree shrews, and rodents. Within Euarchonta, Ignacius and Carpolestes have intrinsic hand proportions most comparable to those of living arboreal primates, while Nannodectes is very similar to the arboreal tree shrew Tupaia minor. These results provide additional evidence that plesiadapiforms were arboreal and support the hypothesis that Euarchonta originated in an arboreal milieu.	0
24376734	PGK1 as predictor of CXCR4 expression, bone marrow metastases and survival in neuroblastoma. BACKGROUND AND AIM: A close relationship between phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and the CXCR4/SDF1 axis (chemokine receptor 4/stromal cell derived factor 1) has been shown for several cancers. However, the role of PGK1 has not been investigated for neuroblastoma, and PGK1 might be a therapeutic target for this tumor entity. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of PGK1 expression in neuroblastoma patients, to determine the impact of PGK1 expression levels on survival, and to correlate PGK1 expression with CXCR4 expression and bone marrow dissemination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from 22 patients with neuroblastoma that were surgically treated at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were evaluated for expression of PGK1 and CXCR4 using immunohistochemistry. Results were correlated with clinical parameters, metastases and outcome of patients. Immunocytochemistry, proliferation and expression analysis of CXCR4 and PGK1 were performed in neuroblastoma cell lines. RESULTS: PGK1 is expressed in neuroblastoma cells. PGK1 expression is significantly positively correlated with CXCR4 expression and tumor dissemination to the bone marrow. Moreover the expression of PGK1 is significantly associated with a negative impact on survival in patients with neuroblastoma. PGK1 is downregulated by inhibition of CXCR4 in neuroblastoma cells. CONCLUSION: PGK1 appears to play an important role for neuroblastoma, predicting survival and tumor dissemination. Further in vivo studies outstanding, it is a candidate target for novel therapeutic strategies.	0
21560306	[Relationship between XRCC3 gene polymorphisms and lung cancer]. OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between XRCC3 and lung cancer after selecting tag SNPs from HapMap database and reconstructing haplotypes. METHODS: Using case-control study design, smoking condition were surveyed by questionare. Peripheral blood of cases and saliva or buccal cell for controls were collected, and then their DNA were extracted. XRCC3 tagSNPs were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. TagSNPs were selected by Haploview, HWE and LD were checked by LDA. Best genetic model and relationship between tagSNPs and lung cancer were analysed by SPSS, and haplotype frequencies and effects were computed by THESIAS. RESULTS: Carriers of rs861537 AG or AA genotype had a statistically significantly increased risk for lung cancer (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17-1.86). Carriers of rs1799794 per G allele had a statistically significantly decreased risk for lung cancer (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.97); no significant association was observed between rs861539 and lung cancer. Smoke interacted with rs861537 polymorphism. Compared with CGG haplotype, carriers of CAA had a statistically significantly increased risk for lung cancer (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.11-1.57). CONCLUSION: XRCC3 gene polymorphisms were associated with lung cancer.	0

10741224	[Homeless persons residing in shelters in the county of Funen I. Psychosocial characteristics and need of treatment]. In the County of Funen (population 460,000) 120 homeless people resided in shelters for homeless people during week 49, 1996. Of these homeless persons, 94 (or 78%) were examined using ICD-10 and the Addiction Severity Index. Ninety percent were men, 90% were aged 20-59 years, 98% were unmarried or separated/divorced. Seventy-one percent had lived alone during the past three years, only 2% were employed, and sources of income for 83% were public assistance or disability pensions. The population of homeless people was divided into three groups: 1) Psychoses were found in 13 cases or 14%--schizophrenia (4%), paranoid psychosis (4%) and affective disorder (5%). About 2/3 had double disorder, psychosis plus substance abuse. 2) Sixty-four or 68% were non-psychotic homeless people, who had alcohol/substance abuse (53 or 83%) and/or personality disorder (57 or 89%). 3) Seventeen or 18% had no mental illness. About 60% had been sentenced to prison at least once. About 20% needed psychiatric treatment.	0
12121962	Efficacy of orally delivered cochleates containing amphotericin B in a murine model of aspergillosis. Cochleates containing amphotericin B (CAMB) were administered orally at doses ranging from 0 to 40 mg/kg of body weight/day for 14 days in a murine model of systemic aspergillosis. The administration of oral doses of CAMB (20 and 40 mg/kg/day) resulted in a survival rate of 70% and a reduction in colony counts of more than 2 logs in lungs, livers, and kidneys. Orally administered CAMB shows promise for the treatment of aspergillosis.	0

17360486	DgrA is a member of a new family of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate receptors and controls flagellar motor function in Caulobacter crescentus. Bacteria are able to switch between two mutually exclusive lifestyles, motile single cells and sedentary multicellular communities that colonize surfaces. These behavioral changes contribute to an increased fitness in structured environments and are controlled by the ubiquitous bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). In response to changing environments, fluctuating levels of c-di-GMP inversely regulate cell motility and cell surface adhesins. Although the synthesis and breakdown of c-di-GMP has been studied in detail, little is known about the downstream effector mechanisms. Using affinity chromatography, we have isolated several c-di-GMP-binding proteins from Caulobacter crescentus. One of these proteins, DgrA, is a PilZ homolog involved in mediating c-di-GMP-dependent control of C. crescentus cell motility. Biochemical and structural analysis of DgrA and homologs from C. crescentus, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated that this protein family represents a class of specific diguanylate receptors and suggested a general mechanism for c-di-GMP binding and signal transduction. Increased concentrations of c-di-GMP or DgrA blocked motility in C. crescentus by interfering with motor function rather than flagellar assembly. We present preliminary evidence implicating the flagellar motor protein FliL in DgrA-dependent cell motility control.	0
6739113	Applicability of the McGill Pain Questionnaire to the differentiation of 'toothache' pain. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was administered to 102 'toothache' patients to determine whether it was sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between dental patients whose pain was clinically diagnosed as originating from a reversibly inflamed tooth pulp (group I) and those whose pain was diagnosed as originating from an irreversibly inflamed or necrotic pulp (group II). Scores for Total Pain Rank Index (PRI(T)), Sensory Pain Rank Index (PRI(S)), Evaluative Pain Rank Index (PRI(E)), Miscellaneous Pain Rank Index (PRI(M)), and Number of Words Chosen (NWC) were significantly higher (p less than 0.05) for group II patients. The PRI differences between both groups were attributed mainly to the more frequent selection by group II patients of 8 of the 20 subclasses of words and/or of words with higher rank values within the 8 subclasses. A significantly greater degree of sleep disturbance, nausea, headache, drowsiness and/or dizziness was also found in group II patients. Discriminant analysis using the 20 subclasses and 4 supplementary questions related to sleep disturbance, changes in food intake or activity levels, and accompanying symptoms, indicated that the MPQ, when used alone, correctly predicted diagnosis and treatment outcome in 73% of patients. Therefore, our findings indicate that the MPQ can distinguish between the two types of toothache and suggest that, especially when used along with other standard diagnostic tests, it may be a useful clinical adjunct in the diagnosis of dental pain.	0
10388389	Retention and marginal adaptation of a compomer placed in non-stress-bearing areas used with the total-etch technique: a 3-year retrospective study. The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate class V and class III cavities restored with a polyacid-modified resin composite (compomer) restorative material in association with two different dentin-enamel bonding systems: Dyract-PSA (Primer Sealer Adhesive-DentSply, Germany) and Prime _ Bond 2.0 (DentSply, Germany). The control group was a hybrid composite used with ProBond bonding system (DentSply, Germany). A total of 116 restorations (79 class V, 37 class III) were made and reevaluated after 1, 2 and 3 years in 55 patients in two private practices and in a university department. Class V nonretentive cavities were located at the CEJ level and class III at interproximal level close to CEJ. Each cavity was prepared using a water-cooled, high-speed handpiece with a fine diamond burr. A small bevel was prepared along enamel margin. Cavity dimensions were no more than 3.5 x 3.5 mm (using burr as reference point). Each restoration was finished immediately with fine diamond burrs and Sof-Lex disks (3 M, USA). The criteria that were evaluated by the USPHS method included: retention, color match, marginal integrity, marginal discoloration, and secondary caries. Results indicated that all compomer restorations were fully retained at 3 years, and that no secondary caries detected. Seven composite restorations were lost during the 3-year study. No statistical differences were observed between class III and class V or among other conditions (e.g., upper-lower arc, sex, age). This study demonstrates that compomers are suitable restorative materials for class III-V restorations. They may represent a clinical alternative to composites in class V and III restorations.	0

7256076	The circadian variation of experimentally displaced sleep. In a group of 6 male subjects sleep was displaced to seven different times of day (one displacement condition per week). The subjects were isolated from external time cues (daylight, clocks, noise) and sleep was allowed to terminate spontaneously. The results showed a pronounced time-of-day variation of total sleep time, stage 2, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Maxima occurred after bedtimes at 1900 hr and 2300 hr, while the minima occurred after bedtimes at 0700 hr and 1100 hr. The latter also was the time of maximum propensity to wake up. Slow wave sleep showed a rapid decrease from high initial levels, irrespective of time of day. Ratings of sleepiness showed a highly significant circadian variation peaking between 0500 hr and 0700 hr. The lowest level of sleepiness coincided with the maximum tendency to wake up, and it was suggested that sleep termination may be closely related to the sleepiness/alertness rhythm.	0

18676418	Video-assisted instruction improves the success rate for tracheal intubation by novices. BACKGROUND: Tracheal intubation via laryngoscopy is a fundamental skill, particularly for anaesthesiologists. However, teaching this skill is difficult since direct laryngoscopy allows only one individual to view the larynx during the procedure. The purpose of this study was to determine if video-assisted laryngoscopy improves the effectiveness of tracheal intubation training. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, crossover study, 37 novices with less than six prior intubation attempts were randomized into two groups, video-assisted followed by traditional instruction (Group V/T) and traditional instruction followed by video-assisted instruction (Group T/V). Novices performed intubations on three patients, switched groups, and performed three more intubations. All trainees received feedback during the procedure from an attending anaesthesiologist based on standard cues. Additionally, during the video-assisted part of the study, the supervising anaesthesiologist incorporated feedback based on the video images obtained from the fibreoptic camera located in the laryngoscope. RESULTS: During video-assisted instruction, novices were successful at 69% of their intubation attempts whereas those trained during the non-video-assisted portion were successful in 55% of their attempts (P=0.04). Oesophageal intubations occurred in 3% of video-assisted intubation attempts and in 17% of traditional attempts (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The improved rate of successful intubation and the decreased rate of oesophageal intubation support the use of video laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation training.	0
22481998	Floating-electrode enhanced constriction dielectrophoresis for biomolecular trapping in physiological media of high conductivity. We present an electrokinetic framework for designing insulator constriction-based dielectrophoresis devices with enhanced ability to trap nanoscale biomolecules in physiological media of high conductivity, through coupling short-range dielectrophoresis forces with long-range electrothermal flow. While a 500-fold constriction enables field focusing sufficient to trap nanoscale biomolecules by dielectrophoresis, the extent of this high-field region is enhanced through coupling the constriction to an electrically floating sensor electrode at the constriction floor. However, the enhanced localized fields due to the constriction and enhanced current within saline media of high conductivity (1   S/m) cause a rise in temperature due to Joule heating, resulting in a hotspot region midway within the channel depth at the constriction center, with temperatures of    8  -10  K above the ambient. While the resulting vortices from electrothermal flow are directed away from the hotspot region to oppose dielectrophoretic trapping, they also cause a downward and inward flow towards the electrode edges at the constriction floor. This assists biomolecular trapping at the sensor electrode through enabling long-range fluid sampling as well as through localized stirring by fluid circulation in its vicinity.	0
11490099	L-arginine immunoreactive enteric glial cells in the enteric nervous system of rat ileum. L-arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide (NO) that may be involved in neuronal activity in the gastrointestinal tract. It is known that NO is formed from L-arginine by NO synthase which is localized in neurons in the enteric nervous system. The present study demonstrated that significant L-arginine immunoreactivity was present in the enteric ganglia. Ultrastructural examination showed that L-arginine immunoreactivity was present in the ganglionic glial cells but not in neurons. These findings suggest that enteric glial cells may represent the main reservoir of L-arginine, which may possibly be transferred to neurons when used.	0
23002250	'Avoidable' mortality: a measure of health system performance in the Czech Republic and Slovakia between 1971 and 2008. BACKGROUND Post-communist health care reforms and the break-up of Czechoslovakia have been studied from various perspectives, but little research has addressed the impact on health system performance. This paper investigates the quality and performance of the Slovak and Czech health systems before and after 1989, including the year of separation in 1993, using the concept of 'avoidable' mortality. METHODS Age-standardized mortality rates for mortality from 'avoidable' and other (non-avoidable) causes have been calculated through indirect standardization to study national and regional trends between 1971 and 2008. RESULTS The paper shows that 'avoidable' mortality in both countries has been continuously decreasing while mortality from other causes has remained unchanged or increased slightly. For some 'avoidable' conditions, mortality rates of the two countries converge while for others divergence can be observed, with either the Czech Republic or Slovakia performing better. CONCLUSION Declines in overall 'avoidable' mortality suggest improvements in the health system's performance and quality of care in both countries, compared with mortality from other causes where factors outside the control of the health care system may be stronger determinants. For conditions where 'avoidable' mortality rates stagnate or increase, more in-depth research should be carried out to identify problems in the delivery of timely and effective prevention and treatment, and to establish steps that would reduce the numbers of unnecessary deaths.	0

22689019	Camel-related injuries: prospective study of 212 patients. BACKGROUND: Camel-related injuries have been less well studied than other animal-related injuries. We aimed to study prospectively the incidence, mechanism, distribution of injury, and outcome of patients admitted to hospital with camel-related injuries in Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates. METHODS: All patients who were admitted to Al-Ain Hospital with a camel-related injury were prospectively studied during the period of October 2001 to January 2010. Patient's demography, time of injury, mechanism of injury, and distribution and severity of injury were studied. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients, all male, with a median age of 28 years (5-89 years) were studied. The estimated incidence of hospitalized camel-related injured patients in Al-Ain City was 6.88 per 100,000 population per year. Camel kicks were most common (36.8 %) followed by a fall from a camel (26.4 %) and camel bites (25.0 %). Camel kicks and falling from a camel were more common during the hot month of August, and camel bites were more common during the rutting season (November to February). Patients with a kick-related injury had a significantly higher rate of maxillofacial fractures compared with other mechanisms. Spinal injuries occurred significantly more often in vehicle occupants who collided with camels compared with other mechanisms (3/7 compared with 7/205, p = 0.0022, Fisher's exact test). Twelve patients (5.7 %) were admitted to the intensive care unit. The mean hospital stay was 8.6 days (1-103 days). Two patients died (overall mortality 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the biomechanisms and patterns of injury and correlating them with the behavior of the camel is important for identification and prevention of camel-related injuries.	0

10051507	Zidovudine (AZT) causes an oxidation of mitochondrial DNA in mouse liver. Zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine [AZT]) inhibits human immunodeficiency virus replication and delays progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We have recently found that, in muscle, AZT causes oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and other signs of mitochondrial oxidative damage. The aim of this work was to test if AZT causes oxidative damage to liver mtDNA. In our study, an experimental mouse model was used in which mice were administered AZT (10 mg/kg body weight/d) in drinking water. Liver mtDNA of mice treated with AZT had 40% more of the oxidized, mutagenic nucleoside, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroxy-2'deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) than untreated controls. This oxidative damage to mtDNA is caused by a significant increase (of over 240%) in peroxide production by liver mitochondria from AZT-treated mice, which was prevented by dietary administration with vitamins C and E.	0

15249237	The responsibilities and contributions of professional educators in surgery departments. BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study is to describe the academic preparation, scope of duties, and scholarly activity of professional educators in surgery departments. METHODS: Educators with doctoral degrees employed as full-time faculty in surgery departments were surveyed to determine terms of employment, academic preparation, scope of duties, and job satisfaction. RESULTS: Twelve of 13 educators responded and participated in the study. Educators spent, on average, 22% of their time on research activities, 33% on administrative responsibilities, 13% on teaching, 13% counseling students and residents, and 7% writing grants. They spent approximately 34% of their time with surgical faculty, 19% with residents/fellows, and 14% with medical students. Educators' contributions to surgery departments included improvements in assessment and evaluation, educational conferences, recruitment, and research productivity. CONCLUSIONS: Professional educators provide support needed to meet the growing demands and requirements of surgical education. Study findings may inform those interested in recruiting a professional educator to their faculty.	0
9014851	Inhibition of L-692,429-stimulated rat growth hormone release by a weak substance P antagonist: L-756,867. H2N,D-Arg,Pro,Lys,Pro,D-Phe,Gln,D-Trp,Phe,D-Trp,Leu, Leu,NH2 (L-756,867), a weak substance P antagonist, inhibited L-692,429-stimulated GH release from rat primary pituitary cells in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 50 nM, L-756,867 shifted the dose-response curve of L-692,429-induced GH release to the right by about tenfold. It also impaired the ability of L-692,429 to potentiate the effect of growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) on GH release. Substance P (1 microM) had no effect on basal or L-692,429-stimulated GH release. When tested in anesthetized rats, L-756,867 inhibited L-692,429- and growth hormone-releasing hexapeptide- (GHRP-6)-stimulated GH secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Complete inhibition was observed at an i.v. dose of 100 micrograms/kg of L-756,867. However, at the same concentration, it had no effect on GRF-induced GH secretion D-Lys3-GHRP-6, a GHRP-6 antagonist, had no effect on GHRP-6 or L-692,429-induced GH secretion even at an i.v. dose of 2 mg/kg. These results indicate that L-692,429 and GHRP-6 stimulate GH release both in vitro and in vivo via a common receptor and signaling pathway which is different from that of substance P in spite of the fact that their effects are inhibited by a weak substance P antagonist.	0

10753825	Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilizes T helper 2-inducing dendritic cells. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) obtained from granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized donors are increasingly used for allogeneic transplantation. Despite a 10-fold higher dose of transplanted T cells, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) does not develop in higher proportion in recipients of PBSC than in recipients of marrow. T cells from G-CSF-treated experimental animals preferentially produce IL-4 and IL-10, cytokines characteristic of Th2 responses, which are associated with diminished GVHD-inducing ability. We hypothesized that G-CSF-mobilized PBSC contain antigen-presenting cells, which prime T-lymphocytes to produce Th2 cytokines. Two distinct lineages of dendritic cells (DC) have been described in humans, DC1 and DC2, according to their ability to induce naive T-cell differentiation to Th1 and Th2 effector cells, respectively. We have used multicolor microfluorometry to enumerate DC1 and DC2 in the peripheral blood of normal donors. G-CSF treatment with 10 to 16 microg/kg per day for 5 days increased peripheral blood DC2 counts from a median of 4.9 x 10(6)/L to 24.8 x 10(6)/L (P =.0009), whereas DC1 counts did not change. Purified DC1, from either untreated or G-CSF treated donors, induced the proliferation of allogeneic naive T cells, but fresh DC2 were poor stimulators. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated DC1 induced allogeneic naive T cells to produce IFN-gamma, which is typical of Th1 responses, whereas TNF-alpha-activated DC2 induced allogeneic naive T cells to produce IL-4 and IL-10, which are typical of Th2 responses. PBSC transplants contained higher doses of DC2 than marrow transplants (median, 2.4 x 10(6)/kg versus 0.5 x 10(6)/kg) (P =.006), whereas the dose of DC1 was comparable. Thus, it is conceivable that transplantation of G-CSF-stimulated PBSC does not result in overwhelming acute GVHD because the graft contains predominantly Th2-inducing DC. Adoptive transfer of purified DC2 may be exploited to induce immune deviation after transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells or organ allografts. (Blood. 2000;95:2484-2490)	0

24336184	Adhesion, invasion and evasion: the many functions of the surface proteins of Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is an important opportunistic pathogen and persistently colonizes about 20% of the human population. Its surface is 'decorated' with proteins that are covalently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan. Structural and functional analysis has identified four distinct classes of surface proteins, of which microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) are the largest class. These surface proteins have numerous functions, including adhesion to and invasion of host cells and tissues, evasion of immune responses and biofilm formation. Thus, cell wall-anchored proteins are essential virulence factors for the survival of S. aureus in the commensal state and during invasive infections, and targeting them with vaccines could combat S. aureus infections.	0
22815032	Congenital adrenal hyperplasia masquerading as periodic paralysis in an adolescent girl. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an uncommon diagnosis in routine clinical practice. 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is its most common subtype, may be diagnosed at birth in a female infant by virilisation or by features of salt wasting in both genders. However, other uncommon subtypes of this condition such as 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency may present much later in adolescence or adulthood. A high index of suspicion is necessary when evaluating children with hypertension, hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis or sexual infantilism.	0

9812331	First trimester ultrasonography of multiple gestations: a review. The objective was to review current literature pertaining to first trimester ultrasonography of multiple gestations. To this goal, all manuscripts published in the English language regarding this topic were selected and reviewed in a MEDLINE search from 1966 through May 1998. Additional sources were identified through cross-referencing. Current widespread application of first trimester ultrasonography and especially transvaginal sonography has introduced a new dimension in both diagnostic and management aspects of multiple gestations. Application of first trimester ultrasonography in multiple gestations enables an earlier and more precise depiction of important anatomical details regarding fetal viability, chorionicity, pregnancy outcome, structural abnormalities, pathophysiology of developmental disorders (such as twin reverse arterial perfusion [TRAP] sequence), early sonographic signs associated with fetal aneuploidy (nuchal translucency and abnormal crown-rump length), and potential fetal growth discordancy. First trimester ultrasonography also assists in guiding operative procedures including: amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, and selective fetal reduction. Enhanced information obtained with high-resolution, first trimester transvaginal ultrasonography is rapidly becoming a standard for establishing critical information that will assist clinicians to stratify management of multiple gestations. Given the increasing incidence of multiple gestations because of various assisted reproductive technology modalities, it is important that obstetricians become aware of the potential advantages of first trimester ultrasonography in clinical management of multiple gestations.	0
24111161	Portable bioreactor for perfusion and electrical stimulation of engineered cardiac tissue. Cardiac tissue engineering aims to create functional tissue constructs that can reestablish the structure and function of injured myocardium. Although bioreactors have facilitated the engineering of cardiac patches of clinically relevant size in vitro, a major drawback remains the transportation of the engineered tissues from a production facility to a medical operation facility while maintaining tissue viability and preventing contamination. Furthermore, after implantation, most of the cells are endangered by hypoxic conditions that exist before vascular flow is established. We developed a portable device that provides the perfusion and electrical stimulation necessary to engineer cardiac tissue in vitro, and to transport it to the site where it will be implantated. The micropump-powered perfusion apparatus may additionally function as an extracorporeal active pumping system providing nutrients and oxygen supply to the graft post-implantation. Such a system, through perfusion of oxygenated media and bioactive molecules (e.g. growth factors), could transiently support the tissue construct until it connects to the host vasculature and heart muscle, after which it could be taken away or let biodegrade.	0

10872637	Sentence and word outline shape as co-primes for target words presented to the two visual hemifields. A lexical decision experiment tested visual field stimulation of word targets after priming the central visual field by the target word outline shape and/or an incomplete sentence. In general, RT was shorter and accuracy better for target words presented to the RVF. Responses were quicker and more accurate to target words presented to either visual hemifield after priming by either a congruent incomplete sentence or a congruent word outline shape (WOS). However, the joint effect of WOS and an incomplete sentence as co-primes was different when the succeeding word target appeared in the RVF than when it appeared in the LVF. While a congruent WOS and incomplete sentence acting as co-primes reduced RT to LVF targets orthogonally. the two variables operated interactively as co-primes on target words presented to the RVF.	0
10325383	Two cases of Chromobacterium violaceum infection after injury in a subtropical region. Chromobacterium violaceum is a gram-negative rod and is isolated from soil and water in tropical and subtropical regions. The species have pigmented and nonpigmented colony types. Infections caused by nonpigmented strains are rare. We report on two cases of infection caused by both pigmented and nonpigmented strains of C. violaceum. Two 24-year-old Korea Airline stewardesses were admitted to Inha University Hospital, Inchon, South Korea, on 9 August 1997, 3 days after an airplane accident in Guam. Both had multiple lacerations on exposed parts of their bodies. There was swelling, tenderness, and pus discharge. The wounds contained many small fragments of stones and weeds. A pigmented strain was isolated from the left hand and a nonpigmented strain was isolated from the left knee of one patient. For the other patient only a nonpigmented strain was isolated from a foot wound. The nonpigmented colonies from the left-knee and the left-foot wounds did not produce any pigment even after an extended period of incubation. The biochemical characteristics were the same for each strain except for oxidase and indole reactions. The pigmented strain was oxidase negative and indole positive, whereas the nonpigmented strains were oxidase positive and indole negative. The patients were successfully treated by debridement and with appropriate antibiotics.	0
8669217	The effects of imipramine, amitriptyline and clonidine administered by iontophoresis on the pain threshold. We performed iontophoresis of aqueous solution of imipramine and amitriptyline, tricyclic antidepressant, and clonidine, an alpha 2 agonist, in a total of 30 healthy adult volunteers. Analgesic effects were compared among the 3 drugs by measurement of the pain threshold using a thermopainmeter. No significant changes in the pain threshold were observed with imipramine or amitriptyline. On the other hand, clonidine significantly increased the pain threshold, compared with the control value before iontophoresis. Although the effects of iontophoresis of clonidine were smaller than the previously reported effects of iontophoresis with other drugs, these effects seemed to be due to the action of clonidine itself not associated with electric stimulation. More marked effects may be obtained with changes in the conditions of iontophoresis.	0
22606211	Patient Satisfaction with Physician Discussions of Treatment Impact on Fertility, Menopause and Sexual Health among Pre-menopausal Women with Cancer. PURPOSE: Pre-menopausal women with cancer are at risk of therapy-associated infertility, premature menopause, and sexual dysfunction. However, it is unknown whether oncologists adequately address these risks during treatment planning. We conducted a study to evaluate physician-patient discussions addressing the impact of cancer treatment and actual treatment effects on fertility, menopause status, and general sexual health. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered in four oncology clinics specializing in breast, gynecologic, general hematology-oncology, and blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) cancer care at a single institution. Eligible participants were pre-menopausal at the time of diagnosis and either actively receiving or within 24 months from completion of treatment. Participants completed the questionnaire at enrollment and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 104 eligible women, a majority were satisfied with the quality (68%) and length (66%) of reproductive health discussions, with the highest satisfaction levels in the gynecologic cancer clinic (85%) and the lowest levels in the BMT clinic (53%). Fertility preservation was desired by 20% of women, including some >40 years old. Women were more interested in discussing treatment impact on menopause status and sexual health than fertility. Rates of discussions on treatment impact on sexual health were low despite 77% of women reporting severe sexual dysfunction at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of women are dissatisfied with the quality and length of discussions regarding the impact of cancer treatment on reproductive health. There is notably inadequate counseling on the effect of treatment on fertility in women > 40 and on sexual function in all women. Oncologists must offer better resources and improve communication on the effect of treatment on reproductive health to pre-menopausal women with cancer.	0
22974653	Physiological and psychosocial age-related changes associated with reduced food intake in older persons. Dietary intake changes during the course of aging. Normally an increase in food intake is observed around 55 years of age, which is followed by a reduction in food intake in individuals over 65 years of age. This reduction in dietary intake results in lowered levels of body fat and body weight, a phenomenon known as anorexia of aging. Anorexia of aging has a variety of consequences, including a decline in functional status, impaired muscle function, decreased bone mass, micronutrient deficiencies, reduced cognitive functions, increased hospital admission and even premature death. Several changes during lifetime have been implicated to play a role in the reduction in food intake and the development of anorexia of aging. These changes are both physiological, involving peripheral hormones, senses and central brain regulation and non-physiological, with differences in psychological and social factors. In the present review, we will focus on age-related changes in physiological and especially non-physiological factors, that play a role in the age-related changes in food intake and in the etiology of anorexia of aging. At the end we conclude with suggestions for future nutritional research to gain greater understanding of the development of anorexia of aging which could lead to earlier detection and better prevention.	0
17927543	Beyond self-selection in video game play: an experimental examination of the consequences of massively multiplayer online role-playing game play. There is burgeoning interest in the study of video games. Existing work is limited by the use of correlational designs and is thus unable to make causal inferences or remove self-selection biases from observed results. The recent development of online, socially integrated video games (massively multiplayer online role-playing games [MMORPGs]) has created a new experience for gamers. This randomized, longitudinal study examined the effects of being assigned to play different video game types on game usage, health, well-being, sleep, socializing, and academics. One hundred 18- to 20-year-old participants (73% male; 68% Caucasian) were randomly assigned to play arcade, console, solo computer, or MMORPG games for 1 month. The MMORPG group differed significantly from other groups after 1 month, reporting more hours spent playing, worse health, worse sleep quality, and greater interference in \"real-life\" socializing and academic work. In contrast, this group also reported greater enjoyment in playing, greater interest in continuing to play, and greater acquisition of new friendships. MMORPGs represent a different gaming experience with different consequences than other types of video games and appear to pose both unique risks and benefits from their use.	0

18575499	Targeted transfection of stem cells with sub-20 femtosecond laser pulses. Multiphoton microscopes have become important tools for non-contact sub-wavelength three-dimensional nanoprocessing of living biological specimens based on multiphoton ionization and plasma formation. Ultrashort laser pulses are required, however, dispersive effects limit the shortest pulse duration achievable at the focal plane. We report on a compact nonlinear laser scanning microscope with sub-20 femtosecond 75 MHz near infrared laser pulses for nanosurgery of human stem cells and two-photon high-resolution imaging. Single point illumination of the cell membrane was performed to induce a transient nanopore for the delivery of extracellular green fluorescent protein plasmids. Mean powers of less than 7 mW (<93 pJ) and low millisecond exposure times were found to be sufficient to transfect human pancreatic and salivary gland stem cells in these preliminary studies. Ultracompact sub-20 femtosecond laser microscopes may become optical tools for nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine including optical stem cell manipulation.	0
20651958	Successful Hemostasis with Recombinant Activated Factor VII in a Patient with Massive Hepatic Subcapsular Hematoma. Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) is known to be effective in the management of acquired deficiencies of factor VII and platelet function defects. But recently, rFVIIa has been successfully used to treat ongoing bleeding in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) condition. The patient reported here was suspected to be suffering from toxic hepatitis on admission. After percutaneous liver biopsy, bleeding occurred and did not stop even after right hepatic artery embolization. The patient developed a severe hemorrhage that resulted in hypovolemic shock, hemoperitoneum, and a massive subcapsular hematoma. The patient then developed DIC due to massive transfusion, as well as acute liver necrosis. The patient was given 400 mug/kg of rFVIIa. Recombinant factor VIIa was administered in an attempt to control the bleeding. This stabilized the hemoglobin levels of the patient. The patient gradually recovered in 4 months. In conclusion, this case suggests that rFVIIa can be successfully used for the hemostasis of uncontrolled bleeding in DIC.	0
7671917	A review of endocarditis in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and human immunodeficiency virus infection. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) was frequently identified in early post-mortem studies of patients with HIV infection, but has not been reported since 1989. The reason for this apparent decline is not clear, but it is possible that the prevalence of the condition was overestimated in the past. We have found no evidence of NBTE in our series of 110 autopsies on subjects from all major risk groups and at various stages of immune deficiency [intravenous drug user (IVDU)-AIDS 35% (39/110), IVDU-pre AIDS 36% (40/110), homosexual-AIDS 25% (28/110), blood product recipients-AIDS 1.8% 2/110), African 0.9% (1/110)]. Infective endocarditis (IE) in HIV infection occurs almost exclusively in intravenous drug users and is rare in other HIV-positive patients. However, asymptomatic HIV infection appears to have little effect on the susceptibility to or the mortality from endocarditis and it is, therefore, appropriate to institute antimicrobial treatment in these cases. The majority (54.4%) of the 960 HIV-positive individuals in the Lothian region of Scotland are young adults who contracted the virus through IVDU around 1983. However, a prospective echocardiological study of 269 patients over four years (IVDU 69%, homosexual 18%, heterosexual 8%, bisexual 3%, multiple risk factors 1%) has demonstrated only four cases of infective endocarditis. We believe this reflects the prevalence of current parenteral drug use in our cohort which has fallen with the introduction of an oral drug replacement programme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0

6759226	In vivo deactivation of peripheral, hepatic, and pancreatic insulin action in man. The in vivo deactivation of insulin action has been studied in 10 lean, nondiabetic subjects using a modification of the euglycemic glucose clamp technique. Following cessation of 40- and 120-mU/m2/min insulin infusions, the serum insulin levels fell to one-half their initial values (mean +/- SE) of 126 +/- 7 and 350 +/- 14 microunits/ml in 7 +/- 1 and 8 +/- 1 min, respectively. The mean incremental glucose disposal rates (IGDR) fell more slowly following discontinuation of the 40- and 120-mU/m2/min insulin infusions, so that the time required for the IGDRs to fall to one-half their initial values (D50 IGDR) were were 42 +/- 5 and 78 +/- 1 min, respectively. Mean hepatic glucose output was totally suppressed during the 40- and 120-mU/m2/min insulin infusions, remained completely suppressed following cessation of the infusions for 50 and 80 mi, and subsequently returned to basal levels. The times required for the HGOs to return to one-half their basal levels (R50 HGO) were 59 +/- 8 and 119 +/- 6 min, respectively. The times required for insulin action to decrease to one-half the initial values in the periphery (D50 IGDR) and in the liver (R50 HGO) were correlated with the preceding steady-state glucose disposal rates in individual subjects (r = 0.75, P less than 0.001 and r = 0.58, P less than 0.05, respectively). The suppression of endogenous insulin secretion by exogenous insulin infusions was also studied in 4 subjects during a total of 5 euglycemic glucose clamps; the mean basal serum C-peptide level was 0.67 +/- 0.24 pmol/ml before administration of the exogenous insulin, fell to 0.34 +/- 0.17 pmol/ml during the steady-state phase of the study, and remained suppressed throughout the duration of the deactivation phase of the glucose clamp. Residual pancreatic insulin secretory capacity was demonstrated by a rise in the serum C-peptide level to 1.77 +/- 0.50 pmol/ml at 120 min following a standardized meal given at the conclusion of the deactivation phase of the glucose clamp. These results demonstrate that the deactivation of insulin action in the periphery, liver, and pancreas lags behind the disappearance of insulin from the plasma. The mechanisms responsible for this lag in in vivo deactivation are not known for certain, but may include slower clearance of insulin form tissue compartments than form the plasma, the necessity for the target tissues to generate specific deactivation signals, or a slow rate of decay of saturable steps in the cellular activation process.	0
24246175	A toxicological and dermatological assessment of alkyl cyclic ketones when used as fragrance ingredients. RIFM Expert Panel. The alkyl cyclic ketone (ACK) fragrance ingredients are a diverse group of structures with similar metabolic and toxicity profiles. ACK fragrance materials demonstrate low acute toxicity. Upon repeat dose testing, some adverse effects in biochemical and hematological parameters, and slightly increased liver and kidney weights were reported, primarily at high doses, resulting from adaptive effects. Developmental effects occurred only in the presence of maternal toxicity. Assays in bacteria and mammalian cell systems and the mouse micronucleus assay did not demonstrate genotoxicity. ACK fragrance ingredients are considered non-irritating to the skin of humans; results showed few reactions, most of which were equivocal or involved doses greater than those in consumer products. Mild to moderate eye irritation in animal tests was observed with most compounds; however, full recovery was usually observed. Human sensitization studies indicate that ACK fragrance ingredients have a low sensitization potential. Diagnostic patch-tests indicated low sensitizing potential in humans; except for fragrance materials which caused reactions at 1% or 5%. Phototoxicity and photosensitization were not demonstrated in humans, and, with the possible exception of acetyl cedrene, would not be expected. It is concluded that ACK materials do not present a safety concern at current levels of use as fragrance ingredients.	0
9681342	Long-term effectiveness and safety of recombinant human interferon gamma therapy for atopic dermatitis despite unchanged serum IgE levels. OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term effects of recombinant human interferon gamma treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). DESIGN: Case series. Patients were treated for up to 24 months. SETTING: University dermatology outpatient clinics in Ann Arbor, Mich, and Portland, Ore. PATIENTS: Twenty-four of 32 eligible patients who participated in a previously reported, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of recombinant human interferon gamma treatment for AD were enrolled. INTERVENTION: Patients self-administered recombinant human interferon gamma, 50 microg/m2, by daily subcutaneous injection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall response; body surface area of involvement; clinical severity scores for pruritus, erythema, edema, excoriations, dryness, scaling, and lichenification; other atopic symptoms; and laboratory parameters, including serum IgE levels, were monitored at quarterly visits. Results at 1 and 2 years were compared with baseline values. RESULTS: All efficacy parameters improved (P<.05). For example, pruritus was reduced by 50% after both 1 (n=24, P<.001) and 2 (n=16, P=.005) years. Allergic conjunctivitis and allergic rhinitis also improved (P<.01). Eosinophil counts decreased significantly (P<.001). IgE levels increased. Clinical improvement more closely correlated with changes in eosinophil counts (r=0.3-0.5) than with changes in IgE levels (r=0.0-0.2). Only 1 patient discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (flulike symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: The initial efficacy and adverse effects reported for recombinant human interferon gamma treatment of patients with AD were maintained after 2 years of long-term use. Recombinant human interferon gamma seems to be a well-tolerated and effective agent in the long-term therapy of patients with AD. Therapies that correct cellular immune defects, but not humoral immune defects, may be effective in the treatment of patients with AD.	0

18223126	The Japanese MCI screen for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders in Japan is increasingly important. The Mild Cognitive Impairment Screen (MCIS)-derived from the National Institute of Aging CERAD neuropsychologic battery-differentiates normal aging from MCI and mild dementia with 97.3% and 99% accuracy, respectively. The Japanese MCIS (JMCIS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), quantitative SPECT (qSP), and quantitative MRI (qMRI) were used to classify 63 outpatients at Fukuoka University Hospital who were either normal or had MCI based on Clinical Dementia Rating scores of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Performance statistics for the JMCIS, MMSE, qSP, and qMRI were, respectively: (1) accuracy = 0.964, 0.768, 0.722, 0.733; (2) sensitivity = 0.958, 0.792, 0.688, 0.700; (3) specificity = 1.000, 0.625, 1.000, 1.000; and (4) kappa validity = 0.813, 0.420, 0.296, 0.308. This initial study shows negligible differences between the English and Japanese MCIS, supporting its potential use for early detection in Japan.	0
22586409	Vascular inflammatory cells in hypertension. Hypertension is a common disorder with uncertain etiology. In the last several years, it has become evident that components of both the innate and adaptive immune system play an essential role in hypertension. Macrophages and T cells accumulate in the perivascular fat, the heart and the kidney of hypertensive patients, and in animals with experimental hypertension. Various immunosuppressive agents lower blood pressure and prevent end-organ damage. Mice lacking lymphocytes are protected against hypertension, and adoptive transfer of T cells, but not B cells in the animals restores their blood pressure response to stimuli such as angiotensin II or high salt. Recent studies have shown that mice lacking macrophages have blunted hypertension in response to angiotensin II and that genetic deletion of macrophages markedly reduces experimental hypertension. Dendritic cells have also been implicated in this disease. Many hypertensive stimuli have triggering effects on the central nervous system and signals arising from the circumventricular organ seem to promote inflammation. Studies have suggested that central signals activate macrophages and T cells, which home to the kidney and vasculature and release cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-17, which in turn cause renal and vascular dysfunction and lead to blood pressure elevation. These recent discoveries provide a new understanding of hypertension and provide novel therapeutic opportunities for treatment of this serious disease.	0
17659316	Characterization of dissolved organic matter in drinking water sources impacted by multiple tributaries. The characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in drinking water sources is important as this material contributes to the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) and affects how water treatment unit operations are optimized. Drinking water utilities often draw water from sources impacted by multiple tributaries, with possible shifts in DOM concentrations and reactivity over time, depending on specific environmental conditions. In this study, results are presented on the characterization of DOM under varying ambient conditions from the four main tributaries of Lake Mead, a large reservoir in the southwest United States. The tributaries include the Las Vegas Wash (LVW), Muddy River (MR), Virgin River (VR) and the upper Colorado River (UCR). One additional sample was collected at the outflow of the reservoir (lower Colorado River (LCR)). The DOM was characterized by both bulk parameters (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA)) and specific physicochemical properties, i.e. size, polarity and fluorescence. The analyses were performed emphasizing limited changes in its natural configuration by eliminating analytical preparation steps, excluding sample filtration (0.45 microm filter). Results indicate that each tributary had a different molecular weight distribution, as well as fluorescence properties, which helped in the identification of the relative source of DOM (allochthonous versus autochthonous). The largest apparent molecular weight distribution was observed for DOM samples collected at the MR site, which is fed mostly by groundwater seepage. The smallest apparent molecular weight was observed for DOM collected at the LCR site, suggesting that retention in the reservoir resulted in a decrease in molecular weight as a probable result of photo oxidation and microbial processes. Fluorescence analysis aided the differentiation of DOM by clearly identifying waters that were affected by microbial activity (LVW, UCR, and LCR), either by wastewater influence or by autochthonous processes, versus limited microbial influence (MR and VR). Polarity analysis revealed clear differences in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature between waters, including temporal differences within individual waters at a particular site. The DOM from the LVW and VR sites had higher hydrophobic character, as measured by retention onto non-polar sorbents. Additionally, the DOM collected at the LCR had the least hydrophobic character. This type of analysis would be beneficial to utilities who want to better understand and manage their source waters, especially in the evaluation of temporal variation within a watershed.	0

11464896	Generation of a humanised single chain Fv (Scfv) derived from the monoclonal Eric-1 recognising the human neural cell adhesion molecule. BACKGROUND: Murine monoclonal antibody (MoAb) ERIC-1 recognises an epitope on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) whose expression in paediatric and adult tissues is confined mainly to the brain, peripheral nerve, and adrenal medulla. Anti-NCAM antibodies have been used for the treatment and diagnosis of a number of tumours, including neuroblastoma. However, whole antibody exhibits poor penetration into solid tumour deposits and rapid systemic clearance upon repeated administration due to development of a human antimouse antibody (HAMA) response. PROCEDURE: To overcome these problems, recombinant DNA techniques have been used to humanise and assemble the ERIC-1 immunoglobulin variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains into a single chain Fv (scFv). RESULTS: Three humanised scFv clones were identified which differ from the predicted humanised sequence by occasional amino acid changes, but these maintain the same specificity as the original ERIC-1 MoAb. CONCLUSIONS: The humanised scFv may prove to be a useful reagents in the treatment and diagnosis of a variety of neuroectodermal tumours and can clearly form a suitable template for the generation of a fully humanised ERIC-1 MoAb.	0

11128973	The location and function of vitamin E in membranes (review). Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that consists of a group of tocols and tocotrienols with hydrophobic character, but possessing a hydroxyl substituent that confers an amphipathic character on them. The isomers of biological importance are the tocopherols, of which alpha-tocopherol is the most potent vitamin. Vitamin E partitions into lipoproteins and cell membranes, where it represents a minor constituent of most membranes. It has a major function in its action as a lipid antioxidant to protect the polyunsaturated membrane lipids against free radical attack. Other functions are believed to be to act as membrane stabilizers by forming complexes with the products of membrane lipid hydrolysis, such as lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. The main experimental approach to explain the functions of vitamin E in membranes has been to study its effects on the structure and stability of model phospholipid membranes. This review describes the function of vitamin E in membranes and reviews the current state of knowledge of the effect of vitamin E on the structure and phase behaviour of phospholipid model membranes.	0

9596310	Cytologically proved malignant pleural effusions: distribution of transudates and exudates. PURPOSE: This study attempts to determine the distribution of transudates vs exudates in pathologically proved malignant pleural effusions and the necessity for cytologic studies in patients with a transudative effusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all cytologically positive malignant pleural effusions was performed at Duke University Medical Center over an 18-month period. All effusions were characterized as a transudate or an exudate based on standard criteria, including lactate dehydrogenase and protein values. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients with a mean age of 62 years were identified as having a cytologically positive malignant pleural effusion and blood chemistry values available to distinguish an exudate from transudate. Ninety-seven patients (99%, 95% confidence interval; 0.94 to 0.99) had criteria for an exudative effusion. One patient (1%) with diffuse metastatic lung cancer had a borderline transudate and was in congestive heart failure at the time of thoracentesis. CONCLUSIONS: Cytologically positive pleural effusions for malignancy are almost always exudates. Cytologic evaluation for malignant cells of a transudative pleural effusion is not recommended.	0
22257375	The GM-CSF receptor family: mechanism of activation and implications for disease. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pluripotent cytokine produced by many cells in the body, which regulates normal and malignant hemopoiesis as well as innate and adaptive immunity. GM-CSF assembles and activates its heterodimeric receptor complex on the surface of myeloid cells, initiating multiple signaling pathways that control key functions such as cell survival, cell proliferation, and functional activation. Understanding the molecular composition of these pathways, the interaction of the various components as well as the kinetics and dose-dependent mechanics of receptor activation provides valuable insights into the function of GM-CSF as well as the related cytokines, interleukin-3 and interleukin-5. This knowledge provides opportunities for the development of new therapies to block the action of these cytokines in hematological malignancy and chronic inflammation.	0

23187669	Light induced fluidic waveguide coupling. We report on the development of an opto-fluidic waveguide coupling mechanism for planar solar concentration. This mechanism is self-adaptive and light-responsive to efficiently maintain waveguide coupling and concentration independent of incoming light's direction. Vapor bubbles are generated inside a planar, liquid waveguide using infrared light on an infrared absorbing glass. Visible light focused onto the bubble is then reflected by total internal reflection (TIR) at the liquid-gas interface and coupled into the waveguide. Vapor bubbles inside the liquid are trapped by a thermal effect and are shown to self-track the location of the infrared focus. Experimentally we show an optical to optical waveguide coupling efficiency of 40% using laser light through a single commercial lens. Optical simulations indicate that coupling efficiency > 90% is possible with custom optics.	0
7529703	Future research needs associated with the assessment of potential human health risks from exposure to toxic ambient air pollutants. This paper presents key conclusions and future research needs from a Workshop on the Risk Assessment of Urban Air, Emissions, Exposure, Risk Identification, and Quantification, which was held in Stockholm during June 1992 by 41 participants from 13 countries. Research is recommended in the areas of identification and quantification of toxics in source emissions and ambient air, atmospheric transport and chemistry, exposure level assessment, the development of improved in vitro bioassays, biomarker development, the development of more accurate epidemiological methodologies, and risk quantification techniques. Studies are described that will be necessary to assess and reduce the level of uncertainties associated with each step of the risk assessment process. International collaborative research efforts between industry and government organizations are recommended as the most effective way to carry out this research.	0
19764265	Practical potential of reverse electrodialysis as process for sustainable energy generation. Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a nonpolluting sustainable technology that converts the free energy of mixing of two solutions with different salinity directly into electrical energy. Although the theoretical potential is high, the practical power output obtained is limited yet due to concentration polarization phenomena and spacer shadow effects. In this work we combinetheoretical calculations with direct current and alternating current experimental stack characterization methods to quantify the contribution of concentration polarization phenomena, spacer shadow effects and stack resistance in RED under different hydrodynamic conditions in a temperature range from 10 to 40 degrees C to show the practical potential of RED. Concentration polarization phenomena play an important role and their influence can be minimized by optimal stack hydrodynamics. Improved spacerdesigns and newspacerconceptsofferextensive room to reduce the spacer shadow effect and to further increase the practical power output Improvement of hydrodynamics and reduction of the spacer shadow effect directly result in a significant increase in power output of the RED process, and values almost double the values currently obtained can be realized, which brings RED close to economical viability.	0
10926643	Evaluation of a new body composition phantom for quality control and cross-calibration of DXA devices. This study evaluated a new body composition phantom and its use for quality control and cross-calibration of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) instruments for measurements of body composition. We imaged the variable composition phantom (Lunar, Madison, WI) on eight different DXA devices. Deviations of up to 7% fat were observed when we compared the percent fat values measured by the different devices with the nominal values provided by the manufacturer. Absolute precision error of percent fat measurements for the phantom ranged from 0.6 to 0.8%. The phantom's percent fat values were also compared with whole body composition measurements from 130 female and male volunteers. The phantom detected differences in percent fat values that were similar to those found by comparing in vivo measurements with values from different DXA scanner models from the same manufacturer. When comparing different models of scanners from different manufacturers, such as the Hologic QDR-4500 and the Lunar DPX-IQ, the phantom showed a different relationship than was seen for patients. Therefore, corrections or comparisons based on the phantom data alone would be incorrect. In conclusion, the Lunar variable composition phantom is capable of accurately measuring the fat calibration of DXA devices and may be suitable for cross-sectional cross-calibration between scanners from the same manufacturer; however, for comparison of DXA scanners from different manufacturers, in vivo cross-calibration is still the only accurate method. The phantom may be used in longitudinal quality control to verify an instrument's temporal stability.	0
11812331	[A study on the use of traditional Chinese medicine agent in ultrasonic instrumentation of root canals]. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the bactericidal effect for anaerobes of infected root canals using Chinese medicine agent Jieeryin combing with ultrasonic technique. METHODS: 60 single-rooted teeth in patients with chronic periapical periodotitis were divided into 3 groups randomly, 20 in each. Hand instruments were used for group 1 as control group of traditional treatment. Ultrasound with saline as irrigant were used for group 2 as control group. Ultrasound with Jieeryin as irrigant were used for group 3 as experimental group. The pre-instrumentation and post-instrumentation specimens of each root canal were placed into the anaerobic chambers and incubated. RESULTS: Significant difference was found between hand instruments group and control group of ultrasound (P < 0.05) and even more significant difference was found between control group of ultrasound and experimental group of ultrasound (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound has special superiority on instrumentation and bactericide of root canals. Chinese medicine agent Jieeryin can kill anaerobes in infected root canals effectively. It is an ideal irrigant for ultrasound which conforms to principles of biology.	0
7381327	Proton nuclear magnetic resonance identification and discrimination of side chain isomers of phytosterols using a lanthanide shift reagent. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra at 90 MHz were measured for a number of side chain isomers of phytosterols (sterols with a C8H17 side chain, and delta 24-, 24-methylene, delta 22-, 24-ethylidene, 24-methly, 24-ethyl, 24-methyl-delta 22-, 24-ethyl delta 22-, and 24-ethyl-delta 22,25(27)-sterols) with or without a lanthanide shift reagent, tris[1,1,1,2,2,3,3 - heptafluoro - 7,7 - dimethyloctane - 4,6 - dionato]ytterbium, Yb(fod)3, and the effect of Yb(fod)3 on the side chain methyl protons is discussed. The change of the chemical shifts induced Yb(fod)3 for the side chain methyls was expressed in terms of the induced shift ratios (ISR values), i.e., the ratios of the induced chemical shifts of the respective side chain methyls to that of the fastest moving side chain methyl. The ISR values were sentitive to minor structural and stereochemical differences, but almost independent of ring structures and of substrate concentrations, thus providing confirmatory evidence for the side chain structures. Also, the Yb(fod)3-induced spectral patterns observed in the high-field methyl region bore the fingerprints of the side chain structures. Several isomeric pairs of sterols, which differ only in the geometry of double bonds or the absolute configuration at C-24 in the side chain, i.e., cis- and trans-isomers of delta 22-and 24-ethylidene sterols, 24R/alpha- and 24S/beta-methyl sterols, 24R/alpha- and 24S/beta-ethyl sterols, and 24S/alpha- and 24R/beta-ethyl-delta 22-sterols, could be differentiated from each other under the influence of Yb(fod)3, even though they were measured at 90 MHz.	0
16409991	Through the central V2, not V1 receptors influencing the endogenous opiate peptide system, arginine vasopressin, not oxytocin in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus involves in the antinociception in the rat. Our previous study has proven that hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) played a role in the antinociception. The central bioactive substances involving in the PVN regulating antinociception were investigated in the rat. The results showed that electrical stimulation of the PVN increased the pain threshold, and L-glutamate sodium injection into the PVN elevated the pain threshold, but the PVN cauterization decreased the pain threshold; pain stimulation raised the arginine vasopressin (AVP), not oxytocin (OXT), leucine-enkephalin (L-Ek), beta-endorphin (beta-Ep) and DynorphinA1-13 (DynA1-13) concentrations in the PVN tissue using micropunch method, heightened AVP, L-Ek, beta-Ep and DynA1-13, not OXT concentrations in the PVN perfuse liquid, and reduced the number of AVP-, not OXT, L-Ek, beta-Ep and DynA1-13-immunoreactive neurons in the PVN especially in the posterior magnocellular part of the PVN using immunocytochemistry. There was a negative relationship between the PVN AVP concentration and the pain threshold; pain stimulation enhanced the AVP, not OXT mRNA expression in the PVN using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR; intraventricular injection of anti-AVP serum completely reversed L-glutamate sodium injection into the PVN-induced antinociception, and administration of naloxone - the opiate peptide antagonist, partly blocked this L-glutamate sodium effect, but anti-OXT serum pretreatment did not influence this L-glutamate sodium effect; L-glutamate sodium injection into the PVN-induced analgesia was inhibited by V2 receptor antagonist - d(CH2)5[D-Ile2, Ile4, Ala-NH2(9)]AVP, not V1 receptor antagonist - d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)AVP. The data suggested that the PVN was limited to the central AVP, not OXT, which was through V2, not V1 receptors influencing the endogenous opiate peptide system, to regulate antinociception.	0

9431284	In utero exposure to famine and subsequent fertility: The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that if prenatal caloric restriction due to nutritional deprivation had affected development of the organs responsible for producing and regulating female reproductive hormones, a woman's fertility would be impaired. METHODS: Women born in Amsterdam from August 1, 1944, through April 15, 1946, a period encompassing a severe 5-month famine, were identified (n = 700; 85% response rate). Date of birth and vital status of all offspring were ascertained by home interview between 1987 and 1991. Famine exposure was inferred from the mother's date of birth. RESULTS: Of the study participants, 74 (10.6%) had no children. The remainder reported 1334 off-spring (1294 singletons, 20 pairs of twins), of whom 14 were stillborn and 22 died in the first 7 days of life. There was no detectable effect of famine exposure on age at menarche, the proportion having no children, age at first delivery, or family size. An excess of perinatal deaths occurred among offspring of famine-exposed women, particularly those exposed in their third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Acute famine exposure in utero appears to have no adverse consequences for a woman's fertility. The excess perinatal mortality in the second generation is unexplained and should be confirmed by other studies.	0

8987849	Food allergy, oral tolerance and immunomodulation--their molecular and cellular mechanisms. This paper describes the molecular and cellular mechanisms of food allergy and oral tolerance including immunomodulation. Food allergy is triggered by an aberrant immune response elicited by oral administration of dietary antigens. Oral tolerance is a state of immunological unresponsiveness induced by oral administration of dietary antigens and is thought to serve to suppress food allergy. This review first describes the characteristic properties of T and B cells relating to milk allergy and also the location of binding sites to T and B cells on allergen molecules. The immunogenicity of allergens is shown to be reduced by the modulations of the T cell binding site, using sophisticated methods such as site-specific mutagenesis. Furthermore, this review focuses on oral tolerance with special reference to the identification of lymphocyte compartment subsets and the immunological mechanism relating to oral tolerance. Finally, the application of oral tolerance for the treatment of allergy is speculated on.	0
20001783	Successful treatment of pacemaker-induced stricture and thrombosis of the cranial vena cava in two dogs by use of anticoagulants and balloon venoplasty. CASE DESCRIPTION: 2 castrated male Labrador Retrievers (dogs 1 and 2) were evaluated 3 to 4 years after placement of a permanent pacemaker. Dog 1 was evaluated because of a large volume of chylous pleural effusion. Dog 2 was admitted for elective replacement of a pacemaker. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Dog 1 had mild facial swelling and a rapidly recurring pleural effusion. Previously detected third-degree atrioventricular block had resolved. Cranial vena cava (CVC) syndrome secondary to pacemaker-induced thrombosis and stricture of the CVC was diagnosed on the basis of results of ultrasonography, computed tomography, and venous angiography. Dog 2 had persistent third-degree atrioventricular block. Intraluminal caval stricture and thrombosis were diagnosed at the time of pacemaker replacement. Radiographic evidence of pleural effusion consistent with CVC syndrome also was detected at that time. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Dog 1 improved after treatment with unfractionated heparin and a local infusion of recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator. Balloon venoplasty was performed subsequently to relieve the persistent caval stricture. In dog 2, balloon dilatation of the caval stricture was necessary to allow for placement of a new pacing lead. Long-term anticoagulant treatment was initiated in both dogs. Long-term (> 6 months) resolution of clinical signs was achieved in both dogs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Thrombosis and stricture of the CVC are possible complications of a permanent pacemaker in dogs. Findings suggested that balloon venoplasty and anticoagulation administration with or without thrombolytic treatment can be effective in the treatment of dogs with pacemaker-induced CVC syndrome.	0

11112061	Influence of ischemic time on hyperacute xenograft rejection of pig hearts in a working heart perfusion model with human blood. In xenotransplantation long ischemic time of grafts is supposed to have a marked influence on hyperacute rejection (HXR). We investigated the influence of different cold ischemic times on HXR of ex vivo \"working pig hearts\" perfused with human blood. Xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNAb) as a trigger of HXR were eliminated by Ig-Therasorb immunoadsorption (IA). Explanted Landrace pig hearts of group G1 and group G3 (with additional IA) underwent 4 h of cold ischemia prior to xenoperfusion. Control groups G2 and G4 (with IA) were kept ischemic for only 46.6 +/- 15.8 and 51.2 +/- 4.2 min, respectively. Ischemic time prolonged the perfusion time in our working heart model (G1: 356 +/- 46.1 min; G2: 125 +/- 31 min; P < 0.05). IA had no additional impact on perfusion time but was effective by itself. The heart weight increased fourfold more in G2 as compared to the other groups. IA without ischemia significantly improved cardiac output in G4 (G3: 198.8 +/- 15.4 mL/min; G4: 338.5 +/- 16.0 mL/min). Coronary flow in G2 was significantly lower than in G1 (G1: 157.9 +/- 9.15 mL/min; G2: 59.4 +/- 20.1 mL/min). Histological signs of HXR (light and electron microscopy) could be found in G2 in contrast to the other groups. Parameters of serological damage showed a minimum in G4 and the maximum in G2. In G1 XNAb were nearly equally eliminated immediately after the start of xenoperfusion as in IA groups G4 and G3. Four hours of ischemic time showed beneficial effects in preventing HXR, possibly caused by changes of the endothelial cell surface (for example, glycosylation or loss of alpha1-3Gal epitopes with a hapten effect).	0
9283078	Nonmediated flip-flop of anionic phospholipids and long-chain amphiphiles in the erythrocyte membrane depends on membrane potential. The nonmediated inward translocation (flip) of the anionic fluorescent N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)- (NBD-)labeled phospholipid phosphatidylmethanol (PM) from the outer to the inner membrane leaflet of human erythrocytes and vice versa depends on membrane potential. Interestingly, inside-positive potentials due to chloride gradients and the native chloride conductance of the cells resulted in an increase of the flip rates. This flip enhancement could be suppressed by addition of gramicidin D, which increases cation conductance, or 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disufonate (DIDS), which inhibits anion conductance. Conversely, inside negative potentials established by an outward-directed K+ gradient in the presence of gramicidin on DIDS-treated cells resulted in a decrease of flip rate. Flip rate exhibited an exponential dependence on membrane potential. The opposite effects of the positive and negative potentials were obtained for the outward translocation (flop) from the inner to the outer membrane leaflet. Similar potential dependencies were found for the nonmediated flip of anionic NBD-labeled phosphatidic acid (PA) and 2-(N-decyl)aminonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (2,6-DENSA) following blockage of the band-3-mediated component of flip. The membrane potential also influences the stationary distribution of the anionic lipids between the inner and outer leaflets. The distribution is shifted to the inner leaflet by increasingly positive potentials and to the outer leaflet by increasingly negative potentials. It is concluded that nonmediated flip-flop of the anionic phospholipids and the long-chain sulfonate represents electrogenic translocation of the unprotonated charged lipids across the hydrophobic barrier.	0

20037354	[A case of liver metastasis treated by cetuximab monotherapy with partial response]. BACKGROUND: Cetuximab in Japan is currently approved as a second or more line therapy for advanced metastatic colorectal cancer. CASE: We report a case of liver metastasis of colon cancer effectively treated by cetuximab after the progression and prolonged neural toxicity of the prior chemotherapy including oxaliplatin and irinotecan. A 61-year-old female suffered from unresectable multiple liver metastases of sigmoid colon cancer. She had already received irinotecan+S-1, mFOLFOX6+bevacizumab, FOLFIRI+bevacizumab, and hepatic arterial infusion of 5-FU+systemic infusion of irinotecan. Although liver metastases were stably controlled by those therapies, her peripheral neural symptom, initially caused by oxaliplatin, became worse after infusion of irinotecan. We decided to give her cetuximab monotherapy in the fifth-line setting. We investigated K-ras gene status on her colon cancer tissue previously resected, which showed a wild-type. Her liver tumor showed a partial response evaluated with RECIST, and the status was maintained for more than four months. CONCLUSION: Cetuximab monotherapy can be used for those with prolonged neurotoxicity and might be effective for the patients with second or more line setting.	0
7203964	Interpretation of particle growth and aggregation patterns obtained from the Coulter counter: a simple theoretical model. We used a simple theoretical model to stimulate the changes in particle size distribution that occur when crystals grow, or disaggregate to a defined extent. The change in total particle volume was used as an index of growth, whereas aggregation and disaggregation were expressed as the change in total particle number. Indices of inhibition of growth and of aggregation in hypothetical test cases were calculated in relation to a control and compared with the inhibition index derived by the standard method of comparing the distribution of particle volume around a given arbitrary diameter on the particle distribution curve. We concluded that the expression of particle growth and aggregation in terms of total volume and number respectively is a preferable alternative to the standard technique.	0
21398290	Mouse conjunctival forniceal gene expression during postnatal development and its regulation by Kruppel-like factor 4. PURPOSE: To identify the changes in postnatal mouse conjunctival forniceal gene expression and their regulation by Klf4 during the eye-opening stage when the goblet cells first appear. METHODS: Laser microdissection (LMD) was used to collect conjunctival forniceal cells from postnatal (PN) day 9, PN14 and PN20 wild-type (WT), and PN14 Klf4-conditional null (Klf4CN) mice, in which goblet cells are absent, developing, present, and missing, respectively. Microarrays were used to compare gene expression among these groups. Expression of selected genes was validated by quantitative RT-PCR, and spatiotemporal expression was assessed by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: This study identified 668, 251, 1160, and 139 transcripts that were increased and 492, 377, 1419, and 57 transcripts that were decreased between PN9 and PN14, PN14 and PN20, PN9 and PN20, and PN14 WT and Klf4CN conjunctiva, respectively. Transcripts encoding transcription factors Spdef, FoxA1, and FoxA3 that regulate goblet cell development in other mucosal epithelia, and epithelium-specific Ets (ESE) transcription factor family members were increased during conjunctival development. Components of pathways related to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition, glycoprotein biosynthesis, mucosal immunity, signaling, and endocytic and neural regulation were increased during conjunctival development. Conjunctival Klf4 target genes differed significantly from the previously identified corneal Klf4 target genes, implying tissue-dependent regulatory targets for Klf4. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in gene expression accompanying mouse conjunctival development were identified, and the role of Klf4 in this process was determined. This study provides new probes for examining conjunctival development and function and reveals that the gene regulatory network necessary for goblet cell development is conserved across different mucosal epithelia.	0
9403690	How opioids inhibit GABA-mediated neurotransmission. The midbrain region periaqueductal grey (PAG) is rich in opioid receptors and endogenous opioids and is a major target of analgesic action in the central nervous system. It has been proposed that the analgesic effect of opioids on the PAG works by suppressing the inhibitory influence of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) on neurons that form part of a descending antinociceptive pathway. Opioids inhibit GABA-mediated (GABAergic) synaptic transmission in the PAG and other brain regions by reducing the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release, but the mechanisms involved remain uncertain. Here we report that opioid inhibition of GABAergic synaptic currents in the PAG is controlled by a presynaptic voltage-dependent potassium conductance. Opioid receptors of the mu type in GABAergic presynaptic terminals are specifically coupled to this potassium conductance by a pathway involving phospholipase A2, arachidonic acid and 12-lipoxygenase. Furthermore, opioid inhibition of GABAergic synaptic transmission is potentiated by inhibitors of the enzymes cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, presumably because more arachidonic acid is available for conversion to 12-lipoxygenase products. These mechanisms account for the analgesic action of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in the PAG and their synergism with opioids.	0
17408383	Transcriptional regulation of the distal promoter of the rat pyruvate carboxylase gene by hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta/Foxa2 and upstream stimulatory factors in insulinoma cells. PC (pyruvate carboxylase) plays a crucial role in intermediary metabolism including glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic islets. In the present study, we identified two regions of the 1.2 kb distal promoter, the -803/-795 site and the -408/-403 E-box upstream of the transcription start site, as the important cis-acting elements for transcriptional activation of the luciferase reporter gene. Site-directed mutagenesis of either one of these sites in the context of this 1.2 kb promoter fragment, followed by transient transfections in the insulinoma cell line, INS-1, abolished reporter activity by approx. 50%. However, disruption of either the -803/-795 or the -408/-403 site did not affect reporter gene activity in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that this promoter fragment is subjected to cell-specific regulation. The nuclear proteins that bound to these -803/-795 and -408/-403 sites were identified by gel retardation assays as HNF3beta (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta)/Foxa2 (forkhead/winged helix transcription factor box2) and USFs (upstream stimulatory factors), USF1 and USF2, respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using antisera against HNF3beta/Foxa2, USF1 and USF2 demonstrated that endogenous HNF3beta/Foxa2 binds to the -803/-795 Foxa2 site, and USF1 and USF2 bind to the -408/-403 E-box respectively in vivo, consistent with the gel retardation assay results. Although there are weak binding sites located at regions -904 and -572 for PDX1 (pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1), a transcription factor that controls expression of beta-cell-specific genes, it did not appear to regulate PC expression in INS-1 cells in the context of the 1.2 kb promoter fragment. The results presented here show that Foxa2 and USFs regulate the distal promoter of the rat PC gene in a cell-specific manner.	1

7522502	The structural complexities of the myelin basic protein gene from mouse are also present in shark. The Golli-mbp gene complex contains two overlapping transcription units with two distinct promoters, of which the downstream (myelin basic protein [mbp]) promoter is more frequently used. A previous comparison of the downstream promoter sequences from shark and mouse allowed the identification of two DNA sequences called the boxes I and II and the wobble zone. The boxes I and II sequence is a composite cis-acting motif that is thought to be involved in the regulation of the downstream promoter. It contains sequences similar to T-antigen, MyoD/E2A, and glucocorticoid receptor-binding sites. The wobble zone codes for an exon (5a in the nomenclature of Campagnoni et al., 1993) that is included in messenger RNAs transcribed from the upstream promoter. The polypeptides encoded by this exon from shark and mouse are 86 and 84 amino acids long, respectively. These polypeptides are overall 59% identical and include a region (residues 41-75 in shark and 39-73 in mouse) that is 89% identical between the two species. A primary sequence analysis showed that each of these polypeptides contains an N-glycosylation site, phosphorylation sites for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C and casein kinase II, and partial ATP- and GTP-binding sites. The shark polypeptide also contains a phosphorylation site for proline-directed protein kinase. These observations are consistent with the notion that the intricate structure and regulation of the Golli-mbp gene complex arose during vertebrate evolution within a common ancestor to sharks and mammals.	0

15191269	Perfectionism, cognitive bias, and hopelessness as prospective predictors of suicidal ideation. Perfectionism, negative cognitive bias, and hopelessness were assessed among people hospitalized for depression (N = 121). Hopelessness and suicidal ideation were assessed 6 months after discharge. Path analyses indicated that higher perfectionism as an inpatient was directly associated with higher suicidal ideation 6 months later. Cognitive bias, in contrast, led to greater hopelessness 6 months later, which in turn led to higher concurrent suicidal ideation. Alternative models examined whether hopelessness partially or fully mediated the effect of perfectionism, whether hopelessness partially mediated the effect of cognitive bias, and whether inpatient depression and suicidal ideation severity explained the observed relationships. These alternative models were not supported. Perfectionism and negative cognitive bias both uniquely contributed to the prospective prediction of suicidal ideation.	0

23034653	Probing graphene grain boundaries with optical microscopy. Grain boundaries in graphene are formed by the joining of islands during the initial growth stage, and these boundaries govern transport properties and related device performance. Although information on the atomic rearrangement at graphene grain boundaries can be obtained using transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy, large-scale information regarding the distribution of graphene grain boundaries is not easily accessible. Here we use optical microscopy to observe the grain boundaries of large-area graphene (grown on copper foil) directly, without transfer of the graphene. This imaging technique was realized by selectively oxidizing the underlying copper foil through graphene grain boundaries functionalized with O and OH radicals generated by ultraviolet irradiation under moisture-rich ambient conditions: selective diffusion of oxygen radicals through OH-functionalized defect sites was demonstrated by density functional calculations. The sheet resistance of large-area graphene decreased as the graphene grain sizes increased, but no strong correlation with the grain size of the copper was revealed, in contrast to a previous report. Furthermore, the influence of graphene grain boundaries on crack propagation (initialized by bending) and termination was clearly visualized using our technique. Our approach can be used as a simple protocol for evaluating the grain boundaries of other two-dimensional layered structures, such as boron nitride and exfoliated clays.	0
8143995	Folinic acid and 5-fluorouracil as adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colon cancer is one of the major health problems in industrialized countries, and its incidence appears to be increasing. Surgical resectability is the most important prognostic determinant, although despite apparently curative surgery, recurrent tumors are common. Metastatic disease cannot be cured, and thus, there is a need for better adjuvant therapies. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with surgically resected colon cancer in Dukes' stage B2 or C were randomly assigned to chemotherapy or observation alone to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy could effectively reduce the rate of cancer recurrence. One hundred and twenty-one patients in stage B2 and 118 patients in stage C were enrolled in the study. Adjuvant treatment consisted of folinic acid 200 mg/m2, intravenously, plus 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2, intravenously, on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for 12 cycles. RESULTS: In stage B2, no significant difference between the adjuvant arm and the observation arm was noted. In stage C, adjuvant chemotherapy produced an advantage over observation in terms of a reduction in cancer recurrence rate with prolongation of a disease-free interval (P = 0.0016) and an improvement in overall survival (P = 0.0025). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that folinic acid plus 5-fluorouracil adjuvant chemotherapy is effective in patients with surgically resected Dukes' stage C colon carcinoma.	0
6980648	Formation of an inactive cytochrome P-450 Fe(II)-metabolite complex after administration of troleandomycin in humans. In rats, it has been shown that troleandomycin induces its own transformation into a metabolite forming an inactive complex with reduced cytochrome P-450. To determine whether similar effects occur in humans, we studied hepatic microsomes from 6 untreated patients and 6 patients treated with troleandomycin, 2 g per os daily for 7 days. In the treated patients, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity was increased by 48%; total cytochrome P-450 concentration was also increased, but 33% of total cytochrome P-450 was complexed by a troleandomycin metabolite. The cytochrome P-450 Fe(II)-metabolite complex exhibited properties identical to those of the inactive complex formed in rats: it exhibited a Soret peak at 456 nm, was unable to bind CO, and was destroyed by addition of 50 microM potassium ferricyanide. We also measured the clearance of antipyrine in 6 other subjects. This clearance was decreased by 45% when measured again on te seventh day of the troleandomycin treatment. We conclude that repeated administration of troleandomycin induces microsomal enzymes, produces an inactive cytochrome P-450 Fe(II)-metabolite complex, and decreases the clearance of antipyrine in humans.	0
18591809	Medicinal foodstuffs. XXXIV. Structures of new prenylchalcones and prenylflavanones with TNF-alpha and aminopeptidase N inhibitory activities from Boesenbergia rotunda. The methanolic extract from the rhizomes of Boesenbergia rotunda (Zingiberaceae) was found to show inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells (IC(50)=6.1 microg/ml). By bioassay-guided separation, four new prenylcalcones, (+)-krachaizin A (1a), (-)-krachaizin A (1b), (+)-krachaizin B (2a), and (-)-krachaizin B (2b), and four new prenylflavanones, rotundaflavones Ia (3a), Ib (3b), IIa (4a), and IIb (4b), were isolated together with 18 known constituents (5a-7b and 8-19). The structures of eight new compounds were elucidated on the basis of physicochemical evidence. Among them, (+)-krachaizin B (2a), (-)-krachaizin B (2b), (+)-4-hydroxypanduratin A (6a), (-)-4-hydroxypanduratin A (6b), (+)-isopanduratin A (7a), (-)-isopanduratin A (7b), alpinetin (10), cardamonin (14), and 2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxydihydrochalcone (15) significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced cytotoxicity in L929 cells at 10 microM. In addition, 2a, 2b, (+)-panduratins A (5a), (-)-panduratin A (5b), 6a, 7b, and geranyl-2,4-dihydroxy-6-phenylbenzoate (17) were found to show strong inhibitory effects on aminopeptidase N activity.	0
10757426	Antiplatelet effect of marchantinquinone, isolated from Reboulia hemisphaerica, in rabbit washed platelets. Platelet activation is involved in serious pathological situations, including atherosclerosis and restenosis. It is important to find efficient antiplatelet medicines to prevent fatal thrombous formation during the course of these diseases. Marchantinquinone, a natural compound isolated from Reboulia hemisphaerica, inhibited platelet aggregation and ATP release stimulated by thrombin (0.1 units mL(-1)), platelet-activating factor (PAF; 2 ng mL(-1)), collagen (10 microg mL(-1)), arachidonic acid (100 microM), or U46619 (1 microM) in rabbit washed platelets. The IC50 values of marchantinquinone on the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by these five agonists were 62.0 +/- 9.0, 86.0 +/- 7.8, 13.6 +/- 4.7, 20.9 +/- 3.1 and 13.4 +/- 5.3 microM, respectively. Marchantinquinone inhibited thromboxane B2 (TxB2) formation induced by thrombin, PAF or collagen. However, marchantinquinone did not inhibit TxB2 formation induced by arachidonic acid, indicating that marchantinquinone did not affect the activity of cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthase. Marchantinquinone did inhibit the rising intracellular Ca2+ concentration stimulated by the five platelet-aggregation inducers. The formation of inositol monophosphate induced by thrombin was inhibited by marchantinquinone. Platelet cAMP and cGMP levels were unchanged by marchantinquinone. The results indicate that marchantinquinone exerts antiplatelet effects by inhibiting phosphoinositide turnover.	0
24415392	Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of EPZ-5676, a novel DOT1L histone methyltransferase inhibitor. (2R,3R,4S,5R)-2-(6-Amino-9H-purin-9-yl)-5-((((1r,3S)-3-(2-(5-(tert-butyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)ethyl)cyclobutyl)(isopropyl)amino)methyl)tetrahydrofuran-3,4-diol (EPZ-5676) is a novel DOT1L histone methyltransferase inhibitor currently in clinical development for the treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemias. This report describes the preclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of EPZ-5676, an aminonucleoside analog with exquisite target potency and selectivity that has shown robust and durable tumor growth inhibition in preclinical models. The in vivo pharmacokinetics in mouse, rat and dog were characterized following i.v. and p.o. administration; EPZ-5676 had moderate to high clearance, low oral bioavailability with a steady-state volume of distribution 2-3 fold higher than total body water. EPZ-5676 showed biexponential kinetics following i.v. administration, giving rise to a terminal elimination half-life (t1/2 ) of 1.1, 3.7 and 13.6 h in mouse, rat and dog, respectively. The corresponding in vitro ADME parameters were also studied and utilized for in vitro-in vivo extrapolation purposes. There was good agreement between the microsomal clearance and the in vivo clearance implicating hepatic oxidative metabolism as the predominant elimination route in preclinical species. Furthermore, low renal clearance was observed in mouse, approximating to fu -corrected glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and thus passive glomerular filtration. The metabolic pathways across species were studied in liver microsomes in which EPZ-5676 was metabolized to three monohydroxylated metabolites (M1, M3 and M5), one N-dealkylated product (M4) as well as an N-oxide (M6).	0

20924842	Comparison of the welfare of layer hens in 4 housing systems in the UK. 1. The welfare of hens in 26 flocks (6 conventional cage, 6 furnished cage, 7 barn, 7 free-range) was assessed throughout the laying period using a combination of data on physical health, physiology and injurious pecking, collected by researchers on farm and during post-mortem analysis, and information submitted by producers. 2. There was an effect of housing system on 5 of the indicators recorded by researchers: gentle feather pecks given, feather damage score, proportion of hens with feather damage, proportion of the flock using perches, and faecal corticosterone. 3. Post-mortem analysis revealed several differences between housing systems in skin damage, plumage damage to the vent and abdomen, keel protrusion, bodyweight, and the proportion of hens that were vent pecked and that had old and recent keel fractures. 4. There was an effect of housing system on 5 indicators recorded by producers: proportion of egg shells with calcification spots, proportion of egg shells with blood stains, weight of hens found dead, temporal change in the proportion of egg shells with stains, and temporal change in proportion of hens found dead. 5. Each housing system had positive and negative aspects but overall, hens in barn systems had the highest prevalence of poor plumage condition, old fractures, emaciation, abnormal egg calcification, and the highest corticosterone. Hens in conventional cages sustained more fractures at depopulation than birds in other systems. Vent pecking was most prevalent in free-range flocks. The lowest prevalence of problems occurred in hens in furnished cages. 6. Although housing system had an influence on the hens' physical condition and physiological state, the high prevalence of emaciation, loss of plumage, fractures and evidence of stress is of concern across all housing systems, and suggests that the welfare of modern genotypes is poor.	0

11337084	The role of CRH in behavioral responses to stress. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and urocortin in the central nervous system affect behavior and can enhance behavioral responses to stressors. The action of CRH-related peptides is mediated through multiple receptors that differ markedly in their pharmacological profiles and anatomical distribution. Comparative pharmacology of CRH receptor agonists suggests that CRH, urocortin, sauvagine and urotensin consistently mimic, and CRH receptor antagonists consistently lessen, functional consequences of stressor exposure. Recently, important advances have been made in understanding the CRH system and its role in behavioral responses to stress by the development of specific CRH receptor antagonists, application of antisense oligonucleotides and development of transgenic mice lacking peptides and functional receptors. This review summarizes recent findings with respect to components of the CRH system and their role in stress-induced behavioral responses.	0
19268677	Sex-specific susceptibility to cocaine in rats with a history of prenatal stress. Across species, maternal stress during prenatal life (prenatal stress [PS]) increases the expression of health complications in the developing offspring. While numerous reports indicate that male rats with a history of PS are vulnerable to psychiatric disease-like symptoms and drugs of abuse, comparable studies with females have been more limited. Here, the effects of PS in male and female rats were compared with the use of two well-validated tests of drug abuse susceptibility--the acquisition of cocaine self-administration and the expression of sensitization to the drug's psychomotor-activating properties. When a low dose (0.2 mg/kg/infusion) was available for self-administration across 15 1-hour test sessions, drug-taking behaviors were unaffected by an individual's early-life stress history. On an escalating-doses regimen (0.3-0.5 mg/kg/infusion) of self-administration, however, exposure to PS selectively facilitated the rate of acquisition and overall drug intake of males. Conversely, cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization was augmented by PS in females, but not males. We conclude that exposure to PS enhances the reinforcing and psychomotor-sensitizing properties of cocaine male and female rats, respectively, later in life. Thus, these results suggest that gestational stress is a sex-specific risk factor for different aspects of substance abuse.	0
24361386	Cationic lipid nanocarriers activate Toll-like receptor 2 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. We provide evidence that cationic lipids, usually considered as a safe alternative to viral vectors as nanocarriers for gene therapy or drug intracellular delivery, do not behave as inert material but do activate cellular signalling pathways implicated in inflammatory reactions. We show here that the cationic lipid RPR206252 induces NF-kB activation, and the production of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6 and IFN-y by human or mouse macrophage cell lines. Further, we demonstrate that the activation of inflammatory cascades by RPR206252 is dependent on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the natural sensor of bacterial lipopeptides and NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), the major inflammasome component. Our results suggest that cationic lipid nanocarriers because of their ability to stimulate the innate system can be used as a new class of synthetic and safe adjuvant for vaccination. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Cationic lipid nanocarriers are typically considered neutral tools for gene delivery. However, as demonstrated in this study, they possess a clear ability to stimulate the innate immune system, and actually can be used as a new class of synthetic and safe adjuvant for vaccination.	0
12784502	Individualization of drug dosage--past, present and future. The development of drug immunoassays led to the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring and the use of population pharmacokinetic (PK) methodology to develop guidelines for individualizing drug dosage. Recognition of pharmacodynamic (PD) variability and identification of PK parameters that best correlate with clinical response has occurred in several areas including oncology, infection and immunosuppression. In the future, drugs will be selected to suit the genetic characteristics that determine the likelihood of a response, while individualization of dosage will consider genetic information on drug metabolism.	0

7698920	Modification of the orbital rim anchorage method for surgical replacement of the gland of the third eyelid in dogs. Excision of a prolapsed gland of the third eyelid predisposes a dog to develop keratoconjunctivitis sicca later in its lifetime, and replacement, rather than excision, of the gland is the preferred method of treatment. One method of gland replacement involves suturing the prolapsed gland to the periosteum of the ventral orbital rim. As originally described, however, the procedure required that the surgeon make a U-turn with the needle and suture within the confines of the ventral fornix. This report describes modifications to the original technique that eliminate this difficult step and make it easier for the surgeon to obtain a secure bite of the orbital periosteum.	0
15465029	Brn-3c (POU4F3) regulates BDNF and NT-3 promoter activity. Brn-3c is a transcription factor necessary for maturation and survival of hair cells in the inner ear. Mutations in Brn-3c are associated with deafness in mice and with hearing loss in humans. Mice lacking Brn-3c also show reduced innervation and loss of sensory neurons presumed to be an indirect effect of hair cell loss potentially through lower BDNF and NT-3 expression. Using transient transfection assays we show that Brn-3c is capable of activating both BDNF and NT-3 promoters in inner ear sensory epithelial cell lines. In vitro analysis shows that Brn-3c binds to specific elements within the promoters of both genes and these elements are sufficient to confer Brn-3c regulation on a heterologous promoter. Additionally, BDNF expression is reduced in the inner ear of a Brn-3c mutant mouse during embryogenesis. Our data suggest that Brn-3c may play a role in regulating neurotrophin gene expression in the inner ear.	1
15094059	G protein-activated K+ channels: a reporter for rapid activation of G proteins by lysophosphatidic acid in Xenopus oocytes. Threshold concentrations of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or acetylcholine (ACh) induce pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive rapid desensitization of responses to LPA in Xenopus oocytes. To demonstrate that threshold [LPA] rapidly activates Gi/o proteins, we used the G protein-activated K+ channel (GIRK) as a reporter. Low [LPA] induced IK+ in <3 s of the agonist addition with little or no activation of chloride current. Depletion of Galphao/Galphao1 each decreased the LPA-induced IK+ by approximately 40-50%, while PTX completely abolished it. This is the first direct evidence showing the activation of GIRK by LPA, and the involvement of G proteins of the Go family in rapid desensitization of LPA responses.	0
21946875	Acute medical admissions for older people from residential care facilities: are they appropriate? AIM: Acute medical admissions are increasing and potentially avoidable admissions (PAA) from residential care facilities (RCF) have been blamed. Estimates for the proportion of PAA from RCFs vary enormously in the literature. This study aimed to prospectively determine the level of PAA to a New Zealand hospital. METHODS: Two cohorts of consecutive acute medical admissions of older (65 years and older) people from RCFs were reviewed (one retrospective and one prospective). Discharge domicile and survival at 6 months were determined for all patients. PAAs were determined by the treating general physician/geriatrician in the prospective cohort. RESULTS: Admissions from RCF are a very heterogeneous group with a wide range of diagnoses, levels of dependency and outcomes. Most admissions (88%) from lower level care (LLC) were appropriate and most returned to their usual RCF on discharge. Patients from higher level care (HLC) patients had poorer outcomes (5/8 died in the acute hospital and only 1/8 alive at 6 months). Twenty percent of all RCF admissions were potentially avoidable and could have been managed in a different setting CONCLUSIONS: Most admissions from RCF were appropriate. However for a minority of admissions, other models of care within RCFs and community care are needed to provide alternative options of care. These may reduce some acute hospital admissions.	0
20840234	Child care and the development of behavior problems among economically disadvantaged children in middle childhood. Research examining the longer term influences of child care on children's development has expanded in recent years, but few studies have considered low-income children's experiences in community care arrangements. Using data from the Three-City Study (N=349), the present investigation examines the influences of child care quality, extent and type on low-income children's development of behavior problems during middle childhood (7-11 years old). Higher levels of child care quality were linked to moderate reductions in externalizing behavior problems. High-quality child care was especially protective against the development of behavior problems for boys and African American children. Child care type and the extent of care that children experienced were generally unrelated to behavior problems in middle childhood.	0
12756174	Retinal pigmented epithelium determination requires the redundant activities of Pax2 and Pax6. The transcription factors Pax2 and Pax6 are co-expressed in the entire optic vesicle (OV) prior and concomitant with the establishment of distinct neuroretinal, retinal, pigmented-epithelial and optic-stalk progenitor domains, suggesting redundant functions during retinal determination. Pax2; Pax6 compound mutants display a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of the melanocyte determinant Mitf, accompanied by transdifferentiation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) into neuroretina (NR) in Pax2(-/-); Pax6(+/-) embryos, which strongly resembles the phenotype of Mitf-null mutants. In Pax2(-/-); Pax6(-/-) OVs Mitf fails to be expressed and NR markers occupy the area that usually represents the Mitf(+) RPE domain. Furthermore, both, Pax2 and Pax6 bind to and activate a MITF RPE-promoter element in vitro, whereas prolonged expression of Pax6 in the Pax2-positive optic stalk leads to ectopic Mitf expression and RPE differentiation in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that the redundant activities of Pax2 and Pax6 direct the determination of RPE, potentially by directly controlling the expression of RPE determinants.	1

24048155	Molecular and fossil evidence place the origin of cichlid fishes long after Gondwanan rifting. Cichlid fishes are a key model system in the study of adaptive radiation, speciation and evolutionary developmental biology. More than 1600 cichlid species inhabit freshwater and marginal marine environments across several southern landmasses. This distributional pattern, combined with parallels between cichlid phylogeny and sequences of Mesozoic continental rifting, has led to the widely accepted hypothesis that cichlids are an ancient group whose major biogeographic patterns arose from Gondwanan vicariance. Although the Early Cretaceous (ca 135 Ma) divergence of living cichlids demanded by the vicariance model now represents a key calibration for teleost molecular clocks, this putative split pre-dates the oldest cichlid fossils by nearly 90 Myr. Here, we provide independent palaeontological and relaxed-molecular-clock estimates for the time of cichlid origin that collectively reject the antiquity of the group required by the Gondwanan vicariance scenario. The distribution of cichlid fossil horizons, the age of stratigraphically consistent outgroup lineages to cichlids and relaxed-clock analysis of a DNA sequence dataset consisting of 10 nuclear genes all deliver overlapping estimates for crown cichlid origin centred on the Palaeocene (ca 65-57 Ma), substantially post-dating the tectonic fragmentation of Gondwana. Our results provide a revised macroevolutionary time scale for cichlids, imply a role for dispersal in generating the observed geographical distribution of this important model clade and add to a growing debate that questions the dominance of the vicariance paradigm of historical biogeography.	0
12413591	European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation (ECAA). Minimum number of centres for reliable International Sensitivity Index calibration of CoaguChek and TAS point-of-care whole blood monitors. INTRODUCTION: Prothrombin time (PT) test systems require multicentre calibration for reliable International Sensitivity Index (ISI). Multicentre calibration of CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC point-of-care test (POCT) systems is less precise than conventional PT testing. The aim of the present study was to determine the number of centres required to give reliable ISI and International Normalised Ratio (INR) with these two POCT whole blood PT monitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A simulation study, based on results of a 10-centre calibration exercise, was performed to assess reliability of ISI and INR when the number of centres was reduced from 10 to 2. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: With both systems, the range of ISI and INR deviation increased as the number of centres was reduced. For the CoaguChek Mini, at least five centres were needed for satisfactory INR deviation in 95% of calibrations. With the TAS PT-NC, three centres gave satisfactory INR at this level. The number of centres required for multicentre calibration of these two POCT PT systems is greater than the two proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for conventional PT testing.	0
6885239	Origin of slow conformer conversion of triostin A and interaction ability with nucleic acid bases. The n.m.r. pattern of triostin A in weakly polar solvents was explained by the presence of two symmetrical conformers. Its S-benzyl derivative still shows the n.m.r. pattern of two conformers, while des-N-tetramethyltriostin A, which lacks the N-methyl groups, gives one conformer. Therefore the slow interconversion of two conformers arises from the cis-trans isomerization of the N-methyl peptide bonds, but not from the reversal of the chirality around the S-S bond. Only one of the two conformers of triostin A interacts with adenosine and guanosine derivatives. Des-N-tetramethyltriostin A can also interact with the purine nucleosides, but more preferentially with the adenosine derivative.	0
11531503	Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations of pi-d itinerant electrons disclosed by band-selective NMR. We present a band-selective NMR method to probe the constituent electronic bands separately in the condensed molecular matter. This method is applied to an organic-inorganic pi-d hybrid metal, and its utility to give the static and dynamic spin susceptibilities for the constituent bands is demonstrated. The analysis of the results uncovers an exotic feature; the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic correlations are enhanced in separate bands in a single material. This finding provides a novel scope connecting the metal-insulator transitions in this system and the manganese oxides.	0
23450495	[A study of interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms in Miao, Dong and Buyi ethnics of Guizhou]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate allelic frequencies of interluekin-10 (IL-10) gene promoter in Miao, Dong and Buyi ethnics of Guizhou. METHODS: TaqMan MGB-based real-time PCR was used to determine the genotypes of IL-10 -819 and IL-10 -592 in 589 Miao, Dong and Buyi ethnics of Guizhou. RESULTS: The allelic frequency of IL-10 -819 in Miao ethnics was significantly different from those in Dong or Buyi ethnics. Allelic frequencies of IL-10 -592 in Miao ethnics was significantly different from those in Dong or Buyi ethnics. In Miao, Dong and Buyi ethnics, the distributions of genotype frequencies of IL-10 -819 and IL-10 -592 were statistically different from Han ethnics from Guizhou and Taiwan of China as well as South Koreans. CONCLUSION: There is a heterogeneity in the frequencies of polymorphisms of IL-10 promoter among different ethnic groups.	0

12651215	Gene discovery in Eimeria tenella by immunoscreening cDNA expression libraries of sporozoites and schizonts with chicken intestinal antibodies. Specific antibodies were produced ex vivo from intestinal culture of Eimeria tenella infected chickens. The specificity of these intestinal antibodies was tested against different parasite stages. These antibodies were used to immunoscreen first generation schizont and sporozoite cDNA libraries permitting the identification of new E. tenella antigens. We obtained a total of 119 cDNA clones which were subjected to sequence analysis. The sequences coding for the proteins inducing local immune responses were compared with nucleotide or protein databases and with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) databases. We identified new Eimeria genes coding for heat shock proteins, a ribosomal protein, a pyruvate kinase and a pyridoxine kinase. Specific features of other sequences are discussed.	0

8287539	Common and rare genotypes of human apolipoprotein E determined by specific restriction profiles of polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA. The three common isoforms of human apolipoprotein E (apo E) differ at positions 112 and 158 and are named E3, E4, and E2 according to phenotyping by isoelectric focusing (IEF). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method allows the detection of common and several rare allelic apo E variants not detected by IEF. We propose a genotyping procedure for apo E that characterizes a given allele on the basis of amplification of specific sequences of the gene followed by the action of restriction endonucleases. When the nucleotide change does not lead to a restriction site, PCR-directed mutagenesis creates the discriminant site, and the differentiation of the three common alleles and five rare variants is possible. We present here profiles of common alleles and of three rare alleles, Weisgraber [Cys112/Asp127/Cys158], Christchurch [Cys112/Ser136/Arg158], and a new rare variant [Cys112/Leu142/Cys158].	0
15913656	Bone resorption by aryl hydrocarbon receptor-expressing osteoclasts is not disturbed by TCDD in short-term cultures. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) are highly toxic environmental contaminants, and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorobenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most potent dioxin. Dioxins bind specifically to the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which is a ligand-activated transcription factor, and a majority of toxic effects of dioxins are mediated via AHR. We have recently demonstrated that TCDD disrupts bone modeling and decreases bone mechanical strength, and that partial resistance to these effects is related to an altered transactivation domain in AHR structure. In order to better understand the effects of dioxins on bone, we studied the presence and precise localization of AHR and also the number and activity of osteoclasts after TCDD treatments. Total RNA was extracted from mixed bone cell population cultures and expression of AHR mRNA was studied using RT-PCR. Bone cells expressed a considerable amount of AHR mRNA. To see which bone cells express AHR, immunostainings were performed in primary rat bone cell cultures, pure human osteoclast cultures and histological sections from AHR knockout and wild type bones. Immunostaining revealed a strong expression of AHR both in osteoclasts and osteoblasts with an especially prominent stain in bone resorbing osteoclasts. Effects of dioxin on primary bone cells were evaluated after TCDD treatment in the pit formation assay. The activity of osteoclasts was not affected measured as the percentage of active osteoclasts and the actual area of resorbed bone. These data indicate that even though TCDD-treated bones show decreased mechanical strength and size, this is not a direct result from increased osteoclastic bone resorption.	0
12554005	Clinical and epidemiological aspects of cardiomyopathies: a critical review of current knowledge. Five years after the second report of the WHO/ISFC Task Force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies (CM), a critical review of the matter appears well-timed. The need for a correct definition of myocardial diseases is emphasized by considering them the result of a 'direct' injury due to different known and unknown causes and not a consequence of ischemic disease or of pressure and/or volume overload. This is in order to eliminate terms like ischemic CM, valvular CM, and hypertensive CM, which are a source of confusion. The concept of myocardial injury is also reviewed. This should not only include the structural/organic macroscopic injury, but also the subcellular, ultrastructural, and molecular damage (mostly of genetic origin) of the contracting element proteins, of citosol, sarcolemma and cell membrane ion channels. As the myocardium is a complex structure, made of common fibers and of specific conduction tissue, injury may be clinically identified either by ventricular function impairment or by bioelectric function defects, i.e. tachyarrhythmias and/or bradyarrhythmias, which sometimes are the unique manifestation of the disease (arrhythmogenic CM, in the strict sense). On the basis of the morpho-functional alterations, CMs may be classified as dilated CM (which could be better identified as hypokinetic CM, referring to the functional aspect, because the morphologic aspect is not always present), hypertrophic CM, restrictive CM, and arrhythmogenic CM (including not only arrhythmogenic right ventricular CM, but also other forms, like the so-called arrhythmias of the 'apparently' healthy heart, due to 'occult' myocardial injury). Moreover, these forms may present in association, like mixed CM (dilated-arrhythmogenic, dilated-hypertrophic, etc.). From an etiologic point of view, it is advisable to maintain the distinction between specific CM, due to a known cause, and primary or idiopathic CM, including, together with sporadic forms of an unknown origin, familial forms of a genetic origin, depending on alterations of contractile or regulating functional proteins, when myocardial injury is the sole manifestation (idiopathic) of clinical picture. The most modern etiopathogenetic, pathophysiological, and clinical features of each form of CM are briefly described in order to suggest a complete definition of the disease and to state a clinical-epidemiological setting that encompasses the current knowledge.	0
16613411	Assessing advance care planning readiness in individuals with kidney failure. The purpose of this study was to initiate development of an instrument to assess readiness of patients to discuss advance care plans. The first step of the development of the instrument involved the generation of a 49-item pool representative of the grounded theory of personal preservation (Calvin, 2004). The second step was to assess the content validity of the items using both a professional panel of four experts in end-of-life care and a patient panel of five persons currently being treated with hemodialysis in an inpatient setting. The third step was to pilot test the resultant 30-item instrument with another sample of 10 patients on hemodialysis. The instrument showed preliminary evidence of content validity (overall content validity index = 0.90) and internal consistency reliability of the scale (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73).	0
22118103	Harmful recessive effects on fertility detected by absence of homozygous haplotypes. Five new recessive defects were discovered in Holsteins, Jerseys, and Brown Swiss by examining haplotypes that had a high population frequency but were never homozygous. The method required genotypes only from apparently normal individuals and not from affected embryos. Genotypes from the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were examined for 58,453 Holsteins, 5,288 Jerseys, and 1,991 Brown Swiss with genotypes in the North American database. Haplotypes with a length of  <= 75 markers were obtained. Eleven candidate haplotypes were identified, with the earliest carrier born before 1980; 7 to 90 homozygous haplotypes were expected, but none were observed in the genomic data. Expected numbers were calculated using either the actual mating pattern or assuming random mating. Probability of observing no homozygotes ranged from 0.0002 for 7 to 10          for 90 expected homozygotes. Phenotypic effects were confirmed for 5 of the 11 candidate haplotypes using 14,911,387 Holstein, 830,391 Jersey, and 68,443 Brown Swiss records for conception rate. Estimated effect for interaction of carrier service sire with carrier maternal grandsire ranged from -3.0 to -3.7 percentage points, which was slightly smaller than the -3.9 to -4.6 percentage points expected for lethal recessives but slightly larger than estimated effects for previously known lethal alleles of -2.5 percentage points for brachyspina and -2.9 percentage points for complex vertebral malformation. Conception rate was coded as a success only if the gestation went to term or the cow was confirmed to be pregnant. Estimated effect of carrier interaction for stillbirth rate based on 10,876,597 Holstein and 25,456 Jersey records was small. Thus, lethal effects may include conception, gestation, and stillbirth losses. Carrier frequency has been >20% for many years for the confirmed defect in Jerseys and is currently 16% for the defect in Brown Swiss. The 3 defects discovered in Holsteins have carrier frequencies of 2.7 to 6.4% in the current population. For previously known defects, map locations and lack of homozygotes were consistent with the literature and lethal recessive inheritance, but numbers of expected homozygotes for some were small because of low frequency. Very large genotypic and phenotypic data sets allow efficient detection of smaller and less frequent effects. Haplotype tests can help breeders avoid carrier matings for such defects and reduce future frequencies.	0
24174349	Impact of GDP, spending on R_D, number of universities and scientific journals on research publications in pharmacological sciences in Middle East. OBJECTIVES: Research in pharmacological science is vital to support the health needs of human beings. Measuring the research output provides information that forms the basis of strategic decisions. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), spending on Research and Development (R_D), number of universities and scientific journals on research documents (papers), citable documents, citations per document and H-index in pharmacological science among Middle East countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the 16 Middle East countries were included in the study. The information regarding GDP, spending on R_D, total number of universities and indexed scientific journals were collected. We recorded the total number of research documents, citable documents, citations per document and H-index in pharmacological science during the period 1996-2011. The main sources for information were World Bank, Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports (Thomson Reuters) and SCI-mago/Scopus. RESULTS: The mean per capita GDP of all the Middle East countries is 18125.49  5386.28 US , spending on R_D 0.63  0.28% of GDP in US , number of universities 36.56  11.33 and mean ISI indexed journal are 8.25  3.93. The number of research documents published in pharmacological science among the Middle East countries during the period 1996-2011 is 1344.44  499.34; citable documents 1286.37  476.34; citations per document 7.62   0.84; and H-index is 30.68  6.32. There was a positive correlation between spending on R_D and citations per documents (r = 0.56, p = 0.02), H-Index (r = 0.56, p = 0.02); number of universities and research documents (r = 0.72, p = 0.002), citable documents (r = 0.72, p = 0.001); ISI indexed journals and research documents (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001), citable documents (r = 0.88, p = 0.0001), H-Index (r = 0.67, p = 0.004). However, there was no correlation between the GDP per capita and research outcome in pharmacological science. CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive association between spending on R_D, number of universities and indexed scientific journals on research outcome in pharmacological science in Middle East.	0
21481098	Gut feelings about the endocannabinoid system. Stemming from the centuries-old and well known effects of Cannabis on intestinal motility and secretion, research on the role of the endocannabinoid system in gut function and dysfunction has received ever increasing attention since the discovery of the cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands, the endocannabinoids. In this article, some of the most recent developments in this field are discussed, with particular emphasis on new data, most of which are published in Neurogastroenterology _ Motility, on the potential tonic endocannabinoid control of intestinal motility, the function of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors in gastric function, visceral pain, inflammation and sepsis, the emerging role of cannabinoid type-2 (CB2) receptors in the gut, and the pharmacology of endocannabinoid-related molecules and plant cannabinoids not necessarily acting via cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. These novel data highlight the multi-faceted aspects of endocannabinoid function in the GI tract, support the feasibility of the future therapeutic exploitation of this signaling system for the treatment of GI disorders, and leave space for some intriguing new hypotheses on the role of endocannabinoids in the gut.	0

11184068	Costs of care for HIV infection in a managed care population from 1995 to 1997. OBJECTIVE: To determine costs of drug and nondrug treatment of HIV-infected patients during introduction of protease inhibitors and combination therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational study of insurance claims data. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from managed care organizations in Texas and California contracting with an HIV case management group were reviewed for all non-Medicaid/non-MediCal adults infected with HIV for costs of drugs and nondrug treatment per HIV-infected member per month from January 1995 to December 1997. Costs of care for patients with and without undetectable viral loads (< 400 copies/mL) were quantified. RESULTS: Per HIV-infected member, average monthly drug costs increased, nondrug costs decreased, and total costs remained stable. Quarterly mortality rates decreased from 4.8% to 0.25%. From the first quarter of 1996 to the last quarter of 1997, the proportion of patients with undetectable viral loads increased from 6% to 56%. Increasing drug costs and decreasing nondrug costs were observed in patients with and without undetectable viral loads, but costs were higher for the latter: after the second quarter of 1996, drug costs were  67 to  277 higher for patients without undetectable viral loads, nondrug costs were  185 to  741 higher, and total costs were  333 to  808 higher. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced mortality rates and increased viral suppression to undetectable levels were observed during introduction of protease inhibitors and combination therapy in this MCO setting. Increased average monthly drug costs per HIV-infected patient were offset by decreased average monthly nondrug costs, and both costs were lower when patients achieved undetectable viral loads.	0
6788029	Tonsillitis due to neisseria meningitidis. Its treatment with rifampin. The Neisseria species with which most otolaryngologists are familiar is N gonorrhoeae, which can cause acute pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Less well known is N meningitidis, responsible for potentially fatal meningococcal meningitis and meningococcemia. Although present in the carrier state in the pharynx of asymptomatic individuals, N meningitidis previously has not been associated with symptomatic pharyngeal or tonsillar disease. Its isolation from a patient with acute tonsillitis and failure to eliminate the symptoms and organism with penicillin led to use of rifampin. Disappearance of sore throat following use of this antibiotic and inability at completion of therapy to isolate the organism from a homogenate of excised tonsil would appear to implicate the organism as a cause of acute pharyngeal and tonsillar infection. It should be added to the list of organisms capable of producing acute tonsillitis, and rifampin should be considered a chemotherapeutic agent.	0

21283078	Slug enhances invasion ability of pancreatic cancer cells through upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Slug, a member of the Snail family of transcription factors, has a crucial role in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing several epithelial markers and adhesion molecules, including E-cadherin. A recent study demonstrated that no relationship exists between Slug and E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer. Another study showed that in malignant mesothelioma effusions Slug was associated with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, but that there was no association with E-cadherin. F-ascin is an actin-bundling protein involved in filopodia assembly and cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial cancer types. In this study, we investigated Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 expression using immunohistochemistry in 60 patients with pancreatic cancer and their correlation with carcinoma invasion and metastasis. Additionally, we observed the effects of Slug on invasion and metastasis in the pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. Alterations in Slug, MMP-9, and E-cadherin were determined by RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Alterations in MMP-9 and F-actin cytoskeleton were determined by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry (FCM), or gelatin zymography. Slug, E-cadherin, and MMP-9 expression in pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with lymph node metastases and we found a significant correlation between Slug and MMP-9 expression; however, no significant correlation was observed between Slug and E-cadherin expression. Slug transfection significantly increased invasion and metastasis in PANC-1 cells and orthotopic tumor of mouse in vivo, and significantly upregulated and activated MMP-9; however, there was no effect on E-cadherin expression. Slug promoted the formation of lamelliopodia or filopodia in PANC-1 cells. The intracellular F-actin and MMP-9 was increased and relocated to the front of the extending pseudopodia from the perinuclear pool in Slug-transfected PANC-1 cells. These results suggest that Slug promotes migration and invasion of PANC-1 cells, which may correlate with the reorganization of MMP-9 and remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton, but not with E-cadherin expression.	0
10982448	Characterization of the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene family and the regulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis in avocado. Avocado (Persea americana Mill. cv Lula) is a climacteric fruit that exhibits a rise in ethylene as the fruit ripens. This rise in ethylene is followed by an increase in abscisic acid (ABA), with the highest level occurring just after the peak in ethylene production. ABA is synthesized from the cleavage of carotenoid precursors. The cleavage of carotenoid precursors produces xanthoxin, which can subsequently be converted into ABA via ABA-aldehyde. Indirect evidence indicates that the cleavage reaction, catalyzed by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), is the regulatory step in ABA synthesis. Three genes encoding NCED cleavage-like enzymes were cloned from avocado fruit. Two genes, PaNCED1 and PaNCED3, were strongly induced as the fruit ripened. The other gene, PaNCED2, was constitutively expressed during fruit ripening, as well as in leaves. This gene lacks a predicted chloroplast transit peptide. It is therefore unlikely to be involved in ABA biosynthesis. PaNCED1 was induced by water stress, but expression of PaNCED3 was not detectable in dehydrated leaves. Recombinant PaNCED1 and PaNCED3 were capable of in vitro cleavage of 9-cis-xanthophylls into xanthoxin and C(25)-apocarotenoids, but PaNCED2 was not. Taken together, the results indicate that ABA biosynthesis in avocado is regulated at the level of carotenoid cleavage.	0
12626013	Excitatory inputs to spiny cells in layers 4 and 6 of cat striate cortex. The principal target of lateral geniculate nucleus in the cat visual cortex is the stellate neurons of layer 4. In previously reported work with intracellular recording and extracellular stimulation in slices of visual cortex, three general classes of fast excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs) in layer 4a spiny stellate neurons were identified. One of these classes, characterized by large and relatively invariant amplitudes (mean 1.7 mV, average coefficient of variation (CV) 0.083) were attributed to the action of geniculate axons because, unlike the other two classes, they could not be matched by intracortical inputs, using paired recording. We have examined in detail the properties of this synaptic input in twelve examples, selecting for study those EPSPs where there was secure extracellular stimulation of the single fibre input to a pair of stimuli 50 ms apart. In our analysis, we conclude that the depression that these inputs show to the second stimulus is entirely postsynaptic, since the evidence strongly suggests that the probability of transmitter release at the synaptic site(s) remains 1.0 for both stimuli. We argue that the most plausible explanation for this postsynaptic depression is a reduction in the average probability of opening the synaptic channels. Using a simple biochemical analysis (c.f. Sigworth plot), it is then possible to calculate the number of synaptic channels and their probability of opening, for each of the 12 connections. The EPSPs had a mean amplitude of 1.91 mV (+/- 1.3 mV SD) and a mean CV of 0.067 (+/- 0.022). The calculated number of channels ranged from 20 to 158 (59.4 +/- 48.7) and their probability of opening to the first EPSP had an average of 0.83 (+/- 0.09), with an average depression of the probability to 0.60 for the second EPSP. Geniculate afferents also terminate in layer 6. Intracellular recordings were also made in the upper part of this layer and a total of 51 EPSPs were recorded from pyramidal cells of three principal types. Amongst this dataset we sought EPSPs with similar properties to those characterized in layer 4a. Three examples were found, which is a much lower percentage (6%) than the incidence of putative geniculate EPSPs found in layer 4a (42%).	0
23836179	Evaluation of nifurtimox treatment of chronic Chagas disease by means of several parasitological methods. Currently, evaluation of drug efficacy for Chagas disease remains a controversial issue with no consensus. In this work, we evaluated the parasitological efficacy of Nifurtimox treatment in 21 women with chronic Chagas disease from an area of endemicity in Chile who were treated according to current protocols. Under pre- and posttherapy conditions, blood (B) samples and xenodiagnosis (XD) samples from these patients were subjected to analysis by real-time PCR targeting the nuclear satellite DNA of Trypanosoma cruzi (Sat DNA PCR-B, Sat DNA PCR-XD) and by PCR targeting the minicircle of kinetoplast DNA of T. cruzi (kDNA PCR-B, kDNA PCR-XD) and by T. cruzi genotyping using hybridization minicircle tests in blood and fecal samples of Triatoma infestans feed by XD. In pretherapy, kDNA PCR-B and kDNA PCR-XD detected T. cruzi in 12 (57%) and 18 (86%) cases, respectively, whereas Sat DNA quantitative PCR-B (qPCR-B) and Sat DNA qPCR-XD were positive in 18 cases (86%) each. Regarding T. cruzi genotype analysis, it was possible to observe in pretherapy the combination of TcI, TcII, and TcV lineages, including mixtures of T. cruzi strains in most of the cases. At 13 months posttherapy, T. cruzi DNA was detectable in 6 cases (29.6%) and 4 cases (19.1%) by means of Sat DNA PCR-XD and kDNA PCR-XD, respectively, indicating treatment failure with recovery of live parasites refractory to chemotherapy. In 3 cases, it was possible to identify persistence of the baseline genotypes. The remaining 15 baseline PCR-positive cases gave negative results by all molecular and parasitological methods at 13 months posttreatment, suggesting parasite response. Within this follow-up period, kDNA PCR-XD and Sat DNA qPCR-XD proved to be more sensitive tools for the parasitological evaluation of the efficacy of Nifurtimox treatment than the corresponding PCR methods performed directly from blood samples.	0

12049955	In vivo quantitation of tumour vascularisation assessed by Doppler sonography in rat mammary tumours. This study was designed to evaluate high-frequency power Doppler (PDS) and to quantify treatment-induced changes in an experimental autochthonous mammary tumour model in rats. A total of 13 rats with N-methyl, N-nitroso urea-induced mammary tumours were split into three courses; 6 rats were treated with epirubicin, 3 received a placebo injection and 4 had irradiation of their tumour with a direct electron beam using a single dose of 18 Gy. In all groups, treatment began when the tumour area reached at least 1 cm(2) and was preceded by the first power Doppler sonography study of the tumour (Echo #1). Echo #2 was carried out in the middle of the placebo or epirubicin treatment (after 3 weeks) or 7 days after irradiation in the irradiated group. Echo #3 was carried out at the end of placebo or epirubicin treatment or 28 days after irradiation. Then colour pixel density (CPD) and vascularity index (VI) were quantitated. Intraobserver and interobserver variability of the CPD and VI quantitation was low (r = 0.99 and 0.97, respectively, for intraobserver and interobserver variability of the CPD values). The monitoring of CPD and VI showed an increase with time during the observation period. No increase in CPD or VI was observed in treated mammary tumours (p < 0.01). Power Doppler sonography quantitation of angiogenesis is reproducible, noninvasive and feasible in this in vivo breast cancer model. The monitoring of angiogenesis according to different treatments is feasible in real-time. Further studies are needed to investigate the predictive value of CPD and VI on sensitivity of mammary tumours to anticancer treatment.	0
8408191	A dual role for mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 in membrane translocation of preproteins. The role of mitochondrial 70-kD heat shock protein (mt-hsp70) in protein translocation across both the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes was studied using two temperature-sensitive yeast mutants. The degree of polypeptide translocation into the matrix of mutant mitochondria was analyzed using a matrix-targeted preprotein that was cleaved twice by the processing peptidase. A short amino-terminal segment of the preprotein (40-60 amino acids) was driven into the matrix by the membrane potential, independent of hsp70 function, allowing a single cleavage of the presequence. Artificial unfolding of the preprotein allowed complete translocation into the matrix in the case where mutant mt-hsp70 had detectable binding activity. However, in the mutant mitochondria in which binding to mt-hsp70 could not be detected the mature part of the preprotein was only translocated to the intermembrane space. We propose that mt-hsp70 fulfills a dual role in membrane translocation of preproteins. (a) Mt-hsp70 facilitates unfolding of the polypeptide chain for translocation across the mitochondrial membranes. (b) Binding of mt-hsp70 to the polypeptide chain is essential for driving the completion of transport of a matrix-targeted preprotein across the inner membrane. This second role is independent of the folding state of the preprotein, thus identifying mt-hsp70 as a genuine component of the inner membrane translocation machinery. Furthermore we determined the sites of the mutations and show that both a functional ATPase domain and ATP are needed for mt-hsp70 to bind to the polypeptide chain and drive its translocation into the matrix.	0
15940258	Diallyl trisulfide-induced G(2)-M phase cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells is caused by reactive oxygen species-dependent destruction and hyperphosphorylation of Cdc 25 C. Molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest caused by diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a garlic-derived cancer chemopreventive agent, has been investigated using PC-3 and DU 145 human prostate cancer cells as a model. Treatment of PC-3 and DU 145 cells, but not a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC), with growth suppressive concentrations of DATS caused enrichment of the G(2)-M fraction. The DATS-induced cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells was associated with increased Tyr(15) phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk 1) and inhibition of Cdk 1/cyclinB 1 kinase activity. The DATS-treated PC-3 and DU 145 cells also exhibited a decrease in the protein level of Cdc 25 C and an increase in its Ser(216) phosphorylation. The DATS-mediated decrease in protein level and Ser(216) phosphorylation of Cdc 25 C as well as G(2)-M phase cell cycle arrest were significantly attenuated in the presence of N-acetylcysteine implicating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell cycle arrest caused by DATS. ROS generation was observed in DATS-treated PC-3 and DU 145 cells. DATS treatment also caused an increase in the protein level of Cdk inhibitor p21, but DATS-induced G(2)-M phase arrest was not affected by antisense-mediated suppression of p21 protein level. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that DATS-induced G(2)-M phase cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells is caused by ROS-mediated destruction and hyperphosphorylation of Cdc 25 C.	0

12015752	Secretion of interleukin-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor by spindle cell sarcoma complicating Castleman's disease (so-called 'vascular neoplasia'). So-called 'vascular neoplasia' (VN) is a rare tumour of unknown origin that complicates hyaline vascular type Castleman's disease (CD). This paper reports a case of VN complicating CD of hyaline vascular type, in which neoplastic cells were shown to secrete interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this case, VN first occurred in the retroperitoneum of a 60-year-old male. The lesion showed typical morphology, with three distinct areas: (1) a lymph node-like area with regressively transformed lymph follicles showing hyaline vascular changes and with a hypervascular interfollicular region filled with slit-like vascular channels; (2) an area composed of spindle cell sarcoma; and (3) an area showing angiolipomatous hamartoma. A proportion of the cells in the spindle cell area showed severe pleomorphism. Subcutaneous recurrence after 8 months was composed purely of pleomorphic spindle cells. A karyotypic analysis of the recurrent tumour showed 47, XXY with some instability. Supernatant from primary culture contained high levels of IL-6 and VEGF, suggesting high secretion of these cytokines from neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemically, p53 overexpression was identified only in the pleomorphic spindle cells of the primary lesion and metastatic tumour. No features suggestive of vascular origin were shown on immunohistochemical or electron microscopic analysis of the neoplastic cells. Human herpesvirus type 8 was not detected by immunohistochemistry or PCR analysis. High levels of IL-6 and/or VEGF have been reported to play a role in CD. This is the first case report that clarifies the site of such cytokine production, showing the possibility of CD as a paraneoplastic phenomenon.	0
18420792	Antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus gp78 antigen: a novel marker for serological diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma detected by xMAP technology. Immunoglobulin (Ig) A and/or IgG reactivities to several Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens have been used to facilitate diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, antibodies against gp78, an EBV membrane glycoprotein, have not been examined to this day. In this study, we utilized Luminex multi-analyte profiling (xMAP) technology to analyse antibody responses to a synthetic peptide of gp78 in sera samples from 95 NPC patients and 91 healthy controls. Our results showed the sensitivity and specificity of IgA-gp78 for NPC diagnosis were 79 and 71 %, respectively, while those of IgG-gp78 were 74 and 73 %, respectively. The IgA and IgG responses to different EBV antigens were not identical within an individual and IgA-gp78 and IgG-gp78 could be complementary to antibodies against viral capsid antigen (VCA), the diffused early antigen (EA-D) and the nuclear antigen EBNA1 for NPC diagnosis. When the six EBV parameters for NPC prediction, i.e. IgA-gp78, IgG-gp78, IgA-VCA, IgA-EBNA1, IgA-EA-D and IgG-EA-D, are combined, the combined predictors were able to reach overall sensitivity and specificity of 91 and 95 %, respectively. Thus, simultaneous detection of these EBV serological markers could improve the predictive values of NPC using xMAP technology.	0

22687484	Recombinant Shiga toxin B subunit can induce neutralizing immunoglobulin Y antibody. Previously, we have shown that chickens immunized with Shiga toxin (Stx) produce Stx-neutralizing egg yolk immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibody. The anti-Stx-1 IgY and anti-Stx-2 IgY exert their neutralizing activity through their antibody activity against the B subunit of the toxin but not the A subunit. In the present study, chickens were immunized with recombinant Stx-1 B subunit (rStx-1B) and recombinant Stx-2 B subunit (rStx-2B). Induced anti-rStx-1B and anti-rStx-2B IgY neutralized the toxicity of Stx-1 and Stx-2 against HeLa 229 cells. The neutralizing activity of anti-rStx-1B IgY on Stx-1 was almost 10 times stronger than that of anti-Stx-1 IgY, and that of anti-rStx-2B IgY was 2.6 times stronger than that of anti-Stx-2 IgY. Anti-rStx-1B and anti-rStx-2B IgY reacted with multimeric and monomeric forms of the B subunits in contrast to anti-Stx-1 and anti-Stx-2 IgY that reacted with only the multimeric form. These results indicated that recombinant B subunits were promising antigens for induction of neutralizing antibodies in chickens.	0
9891539	p53/MDM-2 immunohistochemical expression correlated with proliferative activity in different subtypes of human sarcomas: a ten-year follow-up study. The aim of this study was the evaluation of p53/MDM-2 protein overexpression in different subtypes of human sarcomas, and their correlation with proliferative activity and patient outcome. We selected 40 cases of human sarcomas comprising 6 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH), 1 fibrosarcoma, 1 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 5 liposarcomas, 9 leiomyosarcomas, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 3 synovial sarcomas, 2 osteosarcomas, 1 chondrosarcoma, 4 Ewing's sarcomas, 2 Kaposi's sarcomas, 1 malignant haemangiopericytoma, 1 phylloides cystosarcoma, 1 neuroblastoma, 1 chordoma and 1 unclassified sarcoma. All the immunohistochemical markers, which had been used for the characterization of these sarcomas were re-examined. Additionally, the Streptavidin-Biotin peroxidase method was performed on paraffin sections using the monoclonal antibodies: anti-p53 antibody DO7, anti-MDM-2 antibody IF2 and anti-Ki-67 antibody MIB-1. According to our results, p53 protein nuclear expression was detected in 20% (8/40) of the tumours (1 fibrosarcoma, 2 liposarcomas, 1 leiomyosarcoma, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 2 Ewing's sarcomas and 1 unclassified sarcoma). MDM-2 nuclear staining was determined in 7.5% (3/40) of the cases (1 MFH and 2 liposarcomas). A high proliferative index was demonstrated in 27.5% (11/40) of the tumours (2 MFH, 4 leiomyosarcomas, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1 osteosarcoma, 2 Ewing's sarcomas and 1 unclassified sarcoma). p53 overexpression was associated with high tumour grade (p < 0.05) and MIB-1 expression was correlated with reduced survival (p < 0.05), but p53 overexpression was not significantly associated with either MIB-1 score or with overall survival of the patients. In conclusion, from this limited and heterogeneous sample of cases, we suggest that the p53/MDM-2 pathway is involved in the tumourigenesis of several sarcoma subtypes, but it is unclear if the overexpression of these genes may become prognostic marker for patients affected with these highly aggressive tumours.	0
15112061	Antibacterial effects of knotwood extractives on paper mill bacteria. Hydrophilic knotwood extracts from 18 wood species were assessed in disc diffusion and liquid culture tests for antibacterial effects against three species of paper mill bacteria. The Pinus sylvestris, P. resinosa, P. contorta, and P. banksiana extracts decreased or inhibited bacterial growth. The susceptibility order was P. sylvestris > P. resinosa > P. contorta > P. banksiana, correlating with the concentrations of pinosylvin and pinosylvin monomethyl ether in these wood species. Also, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Thuja occidentalis extracts had a small inhibitory effect. The Gram-positive Bacillus coagulans was more susceptible to the extracts than the Gram-negative Burkholderia multivorans and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans. The main components in the Pinus knotwood extracts were pinosylvin monomethyl ether and pinosylvin, suggesting these to be the active components. Therefore, pure pinosylvin, pinosylvin monomethyl ether, and dihydro-pinosylvin monomethyl ether were also tested. All compounds showed antibacterial effects. However, higher concentrations were needed for these pure compounds than for the knotwood extracts. Pinosylvin had stronger antibacterial effects than pinosylvin monomethyl ether. This work shows that knotwood extracts, especially from Pinus species, have a potential for use as natural biocides in papermaking.	0

21950945	The emergence of cerebral specialization for the human voice over the first months of life. How specialized is the infant brain for processing voice within our environment? Research in adults suggests that portions of the temporal lobe play an important role in differentiating vocalizations from other environmental sounds; however, very little is known about this process in infancy. Recent research in infants has revealed discrepancies in the cortical location of voice-selective activation, as well as the age of onset of this response. The current study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to further investigate voice processing in awake 4-7-month-old infants. In listening to voice and non-voice sounds, there was robust and widespread activation in bilateral temporal cortex. Further, voice-selective regions of the bilateral anterior temporal cortex evidenced a steady increase in voice selective activation (voice > non-voice activation) over 4-7 months of age. These findings support a growing body of evidence that the emergence of cerebral specialization for human voice sounds evolves over the first 6 months of age.	0

12453418	MLL targets SET domain methyltransferase activity to Hox gene promoters. MLL, the human homolog of Drosophila trithorax, maintains Hox gene expression in mammalian embryos and is rearranged in human leukemias resulting in Hox gene deregulation. How MLL or MLL fusion proteins regulate gene expression remains obscure. We show that MLL regulates target Hox gene expression through direct binding to promoter sequences. We further show that the MLL SET domain is a histone H3 lysine 4-specific methyltransferase whose activity is stimulated with acetylated H3 peptides. This methylase activity is associated with Hox gene activation and H3 (Lys4) methylation at cis-regulatory sequences in vivo. A leukemogenic MLL fusion protein that activates Hox expression had no effect on histone methylation, suggesting a distinct mechanism for gene regulation by MLL and MLL fusion proteins.	0

24067957	Local blockade of epithelial PDL-1 in the airways enhances T cell function and viral clearance during influenza virus infection. In order to maintain the gas exchange function of the lung following influenza virus infection, a delicate orchestration of positive and negative regulatory pathways must be maintained to attain viral eradication while minimizing local inflammation. The programmed death receptor 1 ligand/programmed death receptor 1 (PDL-1/PD-1) pathway plays an important immunoregulatory role, particularly in the context of T cell function. Here, we have shown that influenza virus infection of primary airway epithelial cells strongly enhances PDL-1 expression and does so in an alpha interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling-dependent manner. PD-1 is expressed primarily on effector T cells in the lung, compared to effector memory and central memory cells, and shortly after influenza virus infection, an increased number of PD-1(+) T cells are recruited to the airways. Using in vitro cocultures of airway epithelial cells and T cells and in vivo models of influenza virus infection, we have demonstrated that blockade of airway epithelial PDL-1 improves CD8 T cell function, defined by increased production of gamma interferon (IFN-y) and granzyme B and expression of CD107ab. Furthermore, PDL-1 blockade in the airways served to accelerate influenza virus clearance and enhance infection recovery. Our findings suggest that local manipulation of the PDL-1/PD-1 axis in the airways may represent a therapeutic alternative during acute influenza virus infection.	0
10197570	Effects of dietary mixtures of amino acids on fetal growth and maternal and fetal amino acid pools in experimental maternal phenylketonuria. BACKGROUND: Branched-chain amino acids have been reported to improve fetal brain development in a rat model in which maternal phenylketonuria (PKU) is induced by the inclusion of an inhibitor of phenylalanine hydroxylase, DL-p-chlorophenylalanine, and L-phenylalanine in the diet. OBJECTIVE: We studied whether a dietary mixture of several large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) would improve fetal brain growth and normalize the fetal brain amino acid profile in a rat model of maternal PKU induced by DL-alpha-methylphenylalanine (AMPhe). DESIGN: Long-Evans rats were fed a basal diet or a similar diet containing 0.5% AMPhe + 3.0% L-phenylalanine (AMPhe + Phe diet) from day 11 until day 20 of gestation in experiments to test various mixtures of LNAAs. Maternal weight gains and food intakes to day 20, fetal body and brain weights at day 20, and fetal brain and fetal and maternal plasma amino acid concentrations at day 20 were measured. RESULTS: Concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine in fetal brain and in maternal and fetal plasma were higher and fetal brain weights were lower in rats fed the AMPhe + Phe diet than in rats fed the basal diet. However, fetal brain growth was higher and concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine in fetal brain and in maternal and fetal plasma were lower in rats fed the AMPhe + Phe diet plus LNAAs than in rats fed the diet containing AMPhe + Phe alone. CONCLUSION: LNAA supplementation of the diet improved fetal amino acid profiles and alleviated most, but not all, of the depression in fetal brain growth observed in this model of maternal PKU.	0
20701620	Early loading of single crowns supported by 6-mm-long implants with a moderately rough surface: a prospective 2-year follow-up cohort study. AIM: To evaluate prospectively the clinical and radiographic outcomes after 2 years of loading of 6 mm long moderately rough implants supporting single crowns in the posterior regions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty SLActive Straumann short (6 mm) implants were placed in 35 consecutively treated patients. Nineteen implants, 4.1 mm in diameter, and 21 implants, 4.8 mm in diameter, were installed. Implants were loaded after 6 weeks of healing. Implant survival rate, marginal bone loss and resonance frequency analysis (RFA) were evaluated at different intervals. The clinical crown/implant ratio was also calculated. RESULTS: Two out of 40 implants were lost before loading. Hence, the survival rate before loading was 95%. No further technical or biological complications were encountered during the 2-year follow-up. The mean marginal bone loss before loading was 0.34+/-0.38 mm. After loading, the mean marginal bone loss was 0.23+/-0.33 and 0.21+/-0.39 mm at the 1- and 2-year follow-ups. The RFA values increased between insertion (70.2+/-9) and the 6-week evaluation (74.8+/-6.1). The clinical crown/implant ratio increased with time from 1.5 at the delivery of the prosthesis to 1.8 after 2 years of loading. CONCLUSION: Short implants (6 mm) with a moderately rough surface loaded early (after 6 weeks) during healing yielded high implant survival rates and moderate loss of bone after 2 years of loading. Longer observation periods are needed to draw more definite conclusions on the reliability of short implants supporting single crowns.	0
21216472	Differential sensory gating functions between smokers and non-smokers among drug-naive first episode schizophrenic patients. Although an acute effect of cigarette smoking and nicotine on sensory gating of schizophrenias has been investigated in published papers, the chronic effect of cigarette smoking on this phenomenon has not yet been reported. We report the effects of chronic cigarette smoking, without new acute exposure before testing, on sensory gating using the P50 auditory evoked potential in a group of drug-naive first episode schizophrenic smokers and healthy smokers. Sensory gating was evaluated using auditory P50 suppression elicited using the conditioning (S1)-testing (S2) paradigm. Fifty six male drug-naive first episode schizophrenic patients were compared to 41 healthy male controls. Patients were classified into subgroups of current smokers (n=18) and non-smokers (n=38) to explore the effects of smoking on sensory gating. All subjects did not smoke a cigarette for at least 1h prior to testing. Schizophrenic patients showed an increased S2 amplitude and a poorer sensory gating as measured by both S2/S1 ratio and S1-S2 difference of P50 amplitude, as compared to healthy controls. However, smokers showed an increased S1 amplitude and better sensory gating than did non-smokers both in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Our findings support a sensory gating deficit among first episode schizophrenic patients. However, it was less pronounced among schizophrenic patients who were current cigarette smokers, suggesting a positive effect of chronic cigarette smoking on ameliorating this sensory gating deficit in schizophrenia. Our findings of the present study present new evidence supporting the self-medication hypothesis of self-medication by cigarette smoking in schizophrenia to possibly ameliorate pre-existing functional deficits.	0
19032853	Comparison of the new injury severity score and the injury severity score in multiple trauma patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether these characteristics of less misclassification and greater area under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of the new injury severity score (NISS) are better than the injury severity score (ISS) as applying it to our multiple trauma patients registered into the emergency intensive care unit (EICU). METHODS: This was a retrospective review of registry data from 2 286 multiple trauma patients consecutively registered into the EICU from January 1,1997 to December 31, 2006 in the Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University in China. Comparisons between ISS and NISS were made using misclassification rates, ROC curve analysis, and the H-L statistics by univariate and multivariate logistic progression model. RESULTS: Among the 2 286 patients, 176 (7.7%) were excluded because of deaths on arrival or patients less than 16 years of age. The study population therefore comprised 2 110 patients. Mean EICU length of stay (LOS) was 7.8 days ?2.4 days. Compared with the blunt injury group, the penetrating injury group had a higher percentage of male, lower mean EICU LOS and age. The most frequently injured body regions were extremities and head/neck, followed by thorax, face and abdomen in the blunt injury group; whereas, thorax and abdomen were more frequently seen in the penetrating injury group. The minimum misclassification rate for NISS was slightly less than ISS in all groups (4.01% versus 4.49%). However, NISS had more tendency to misclassify in the penetrating injury group. This, we noted, was attributed mainly to a higher false-positive rate (21.04% versus 15.55% for ISS, t equal to 3.310, P less than 0.001), resulting in an overall misclassification rate of 23.57% for NISS versus 18.79% for ISS (t equal to 3.290, P less than 0.001). In the whole sample, NISS presented equivalent discrimination (area under ROC curve: NISS equal to 0.938 versus ISS equal to 0.943). The H-L statistics showed poorer calibration (48.64 versus 32.11, t equal to 3.305, P less than 0.001) in the penetrating injury group. CONCLUSIONS: NISS should not replace ISS because they share similar accuracy and calibration in predicting multiple blunt trauma patients. NISS may be more sensitive but less specific than ISS in predicting mortality in certain penetrating injury patients.	0
19308199	Biology of Anguina plantaginis parasitic on Plantago aristata. Among 17 species and cultivars of plants exposed to Anguina plantaginis, only Plantago aristata (bracted plantain) was a host. Larvae penetrated the emerging apical meristem; reproduces and migrated progressively; caused twisting and galling of leaves, looping andspiraling of peduncles, and transformation of floral structures into galls. Extreme infections caused stunting and death of entire plants. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of leaf mesophyll, cell separation and disintegration, and xylem wall thickening in older galls occurred. Only third-stage larvae were infective, and they exhibited cryptobiosis under adverse conditions.	0
21135464	A conceptually new type of bio-hybrid scaffold for bone regeneration. Magnetic bio-hybrid porous scaffolds have been synthesized, nucleating nano-apatite in situ on self-assembling collagen, in the presence of magnetite nano-particles. The magnetic phase acted as a sort of cross-linking agent for the collagen, inducing a chemico-physical-mechanical stabilization of the material and allowing us to control the porosity network of the scaffold. Gradients of bio-mineralization and magnetization were also developed for osteochondral application. The good potentiality of the material as a biomedical device, able to offer assistance to bone regeneration through scaffold reloading with specific factors guided by an external magnetic field, has been preliminarily investigated. Up to now the proof of this concept has been realized through in vitro assessments.	0

8066157	Imipramine in alopecia areata. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Alopecia areata (AA) is a dermatologic disease whose onset is significantly associated to life events. Its course may often be characterized by high levels of anxiety and depression. These observations suggested a rationale for using an antidepressant in AA. Thirteen patients were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of efficacy of imipramine in alopecia. After six months clinically significant hair regrowth occurred in 5 of the 7 patients on imipramine, whereas no response was observed in the placebo group. An improvement in psychic symptomatology was present in both groups. Our preliminary results indicate the potential efficacy of imipramine in patients with AA, not acting directly through a reduction of anxiety or depression.	0
15331683	Neuroepithelial oxygen chemoreceptors of the zebrafish gill. In aquatic vertebrates, hypoxia induces physiological changes that arise principally from O(2) chemoreceptors of the gill. Neuroepithelial cells (NECs) of the zebrafish gill are morphologically similar to mammalian O(2) chemoreceptors (e.g. carotid body), suggesting that they may play a role in initiating the hypoxia response in fish. We describe morphological changes of zebrafish gill NECs following in vivo exposure to chronic hypoxia, and characterize the cellular mechanisms of O(2) sensing in isolated NECs using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Confocal immunofluorescence studies indicated that chronic hypoxia (P(O(2)) = 35 mmHg, 60 days) induced hypertrophy, proliferation and process extension in NECs immunoreactive for serotonin or synaptic vesicle protein (SV2). Under voltage clamp, NECs responded to hypoxia (P(O(2)) = 25-140 mmHg) with a dose-dependent decrease in K(+) current. The current-voltage relationship of the O(2)-sensitive current (I(KO(2))) reversed near E(K) and displayed open rectification. Pharmacological characterization indicated that I(KO(2)) was resistant to 20 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 5 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but was sensitive to 1 mm quinidine. In current-clamp recordings, hypoxia produced membrane depolarization associated with a conductance decrease; this depolarization was blocked by quinidine, but was insensitive to TEA and 4-AP. These biophysical and pharmacological characteristics suggest that hypoxia sensing in zebrafish gill NECs is mediated by inhibition of a background K(+) conductance, which generates a receptor potential necessary for neurosecretion and activation of sensory pathways in the gill. This appears to be a fundamental mechanism of O(2) sensing that arose early in vertebrate evolution, and was adopted later in mammalian O(2) chemoreceptors.	0
20874437	The anti-osteoporotic effect of Eurycoma Longifolia in aged orchidectomised rat model. Osteoporosis in elderly men is becoming an important health issue with the aging society. Elderly men with androgen deficiency are exposed to osteoporosis and can be treated with testosterone replacement. In this study, Eurycoma longifolia (EL), a plant with androgenic effects, was supplemented to an androgen-deficient osteoporotic aged rat as alternative to testosterone. Aged 12 months old Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into groups of normal control (NC), sham-operated (SO), orchidectomised-control (OrxC), orchidectomised and supplemented with EL (Orx + El) and orchidectomised and given testosterone (Orx + T). After 6 weeks of treatment, serum osteocalcin, serum terminal C-telopeptide Type 1 collagen (CTX) and the fourth lumbar bone calcium were measured. There were no significant differences in the osteocalcin levels before and after treatment in all the groups. The CTX levels were also similar for all the groups before treatment. However, after treatment, orchidectomy had caused significant elevation of CTX compared to normal control rats. Testosterone replacements in orchidectomised rats were able to prevent the rise of CTX. Orchidectomy had also reduced the bone calcium level compared to normal control rats. Both testosterone replacement and EL supplementation to orchidectomised rats were able to maintain the bone calcium level, with the former showing better effects. As a conclusion, EL prevented bone calcium loss in orchidectomised rats and therefore has the potential to be used as an alternative treatment for androgen deficient osteoporosis.	0
12290329	Maize yields hope. Reports from the field -- Africa. In Burundi, researchers supported by IDRC have developed several high-yield varieties of maize that are resistant to the streak virus. Although previously more prevalent at low altitudes, the virus, which is carried by a leafhopper (Cicadulina spp.), has increased its affects at higher altitudes. A maize improvement program was established in 1978, with IDRC help, by ISABU, the national agricultural research institute of Burundi; however, the local and foreign maize varieties that were tested were poorly adapted to local conditions and succumbed to the streak virus. Also, farmers preferred a crop that would be ready to harvest in 4-5 because two crops a year would be possible. In 1985, Dr. Dunstan Malithano, a Malawian researcher who had previously worked for IDRC in Mozambique, joined the team. He changed the emphasis to improving local maize populations; superior varieties were being distributed within two years. By 1989, three high-yield varieties resistant to streak disease had been developed; Mugamba 1 and Isega 1 were appropriate for the high and medium altitude areas, and Imbo 1 was appropriate for the lake shores and Imbo plains. Imbo 1 could also be used for making beer, and Dr. Malithano negotiated with the brewery to multiply his improved varieties. Enough seed was produced by the brewery in one year for a limited number of farmers who, in turn, produced 43 tons of seed. This was sold to farmers throughout the Rift Valley who sold their crop back to the brewery. By 1994, 80% of all Burundi maize growers were using these varieties successfully. Kenyan farmers are now interested, and Burundi researchers have been trained to take over the breeding program completely.	0
12006751	A single-incision laparoscopic technique for retrieval and replacement of disconnected ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing found in the peritoneum. A 7-year-old girl presented with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure 2 years after insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt. Evaluation revealed disconnection of the distal shunt catheter and migration into the peritoneal cavity. A single-incision laparoscopic procedure was performed to locate and remove the disconnected shunt tubing, and the new shunt catheter was inserted through the laparoscopic port site. Laparoscopy is being used more frequently for evaluation and repair of distal VP shunt malfunctions, but generally still requires multiple incisions for port placement and insertion of the new shunt catheter. The single-incision technique used here is technically feasible, allows excellent visualization of the peritoneal cavity and does not require any incisions beyond the previous one used for initial shunt insertion.	0

19680918	Comparison of a fluoroquinolone surface plasmon resonance biosensor screening assay with established methods. The performance of a previously developed immunochemical biosensor screening method for fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics in poultry muscle, fish and egg was compared with established methods. Blank sample material of the target matrices was individually spiked with the FQs at half maximum residue levels. Homogeneity of the test materials was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Identical sets of spiked samples as well as incurred samples from a previous feeding experiment were sent to three independent laboratories and analysed by LC-MS/MS, a microbiological assay and the new biosensor assay. The new method correctly identified all contaminated samples and demonstrated advantages in sensitivity and analysis time compared to the microbiological screening assay.	0
20591809	Breast cancer survivors' perspectives of care practices in Western and alternative medicine. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore perspectives of breast cancer survivors about their care with Western medicine and alternative medicine. RESEARCH APPROACH: Qualitative, ethnonursing. SETTING: Cancer center in the midwestern region of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 9 breast cancer survivors who had experienced health care involving Western medicine and alternative medicine. METHODOLOGIC APPROACH: Semistructured interviews were conducted to elicit each participant's perspective about care practices. Data were analyzed with an ethnonursing qualitative data analysis method. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Care practices in Western medicine and care practices in alternative medicine. FINDINGS: Western medicine was seen as traditional or mainstream treatment, whereas alternative medicine was seen as anything not involving hospitals and doctors or as complementary. Perceived outcomes from alternative therapies were coping with disease and treatment, holistic care, and emotional support, whereas perceived outcomes from Western medicine were negative things that they had to go through and as an instrument of God. Kinship, social, economical, educational, and belief factors influenced care practices. CONCLUSIONS: Care practices from alternative medicine or Western medicine vary for breast cancer survivors. Many factors influence their selection decisions about care practices. INTERPRETATION: Nurses should be concerned about what care practices mean to breast cancer survivors. Further research should be considered to evaluate the potential contribution of each factor to breast cancer survivors' decision making about care practices.	0
16030153	Postprandial interleukin-6 release from skeletal muscle in men with impaired glucose tolerance can be reduced by weight loss. CONTEXT: Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with increased levels of IL-6, a marker of inflammation. OBJECTIVE: This study addressed the question of whether IL-6 was released from skeletal muscle after a high-fat meal in men with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), a prediabetic state, and whether IL-6 release could be reduced by weight loss. DESIGN: Skeletal muscle metabolism was studied in men with IGT (n = 11) and compared with men with normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n = 9), matched for body mass index and age. IL-6 flux over skeletal muscle was measured with the forearm model. Eight IGT men were willing to participate in a 12-wk weight loss program and were tested again. RESULTS: IL-6, but not C-reactive protein or TNF-alpha receptor 1 and 2, was released by skeletal muscle. Muscle IL-6 release was higher in IGT than in NGT during fasting (IGT = 2.26 +/- 1.89 vs. NGT = 0.87 +/- 0.48 fmol x 100 ml tissue(-1) x min(-1), P = 0.04) and after a meal (mean area under the curve per minute: IGT = 3.48 +/- 2.63 vs. NGT = 1.37 +/- 0.75 fmol x 100 ml tissue(-1) x min(-1); P = 0.03). In the IGT men, body weight loss resulted in a decrease of postprandial IL-6 release from skeletal muscle (-52%; P = 0.04), reaching levels of the obese, NGT controls. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that a high-fat meal can evoke IL-6 release from muscle and that the IL-6 release is a consequence rather than a cause of the obese, insulin-resistant, and/or IGT state.	0
11088454	Fluctuation-response relations for multitime correlations We show that time-correlation functions of arbitrary order for any random variable in a statistical dynamical system can be calculated as higher-order response functions of the mean history of the variable. The response is to a \"control term\" added as a modification to the master equation for statistical distributions. The proof of the relations is based upon a variational characterization of the generating functional of the time correlations. The same fluctuation-response relations are preserved within moment closures for the statistical dynamical system, when these are constructed via the variational Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. For the two-time correlations of the moment variables themselves, the fluctuation-response relation is equivalent to an \"Onsager regression hypothesis\" for the small fluctuations. For correlations of higher order, there is a further effect in addition to such linear propagation of fluctuations present instantaneously: the dynamical generation of correlations by nonlinear interaction of fluctuations. In general, we discuss some physical and mathematical aspects of the Ansatze required for an accurate calculation of the time correlations. We also comment briefly upon the computational use of these relations, which is well suited for automatic differentiation tools. An example will be given of a simple closure for turbulent energy decay, which illustrates the numerical application of the relations.	0
12654933	Rapid divergence of the ecdysone receptor in Diptera and Lepidoptera suggests coevolution between ECR and USP-RXR. Ecdysteroid hormones are major regulators in reproduction and development of insects, including larval molts and metamorphosis. The functional ecdysone receptor is a heterodimer of ECR (NR1H1) and USP-RXR (NR2B4), which is the orthologue of vertebrate retinoid X receptors (RXR alpha, beta, gamma). Both proteins belong to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, ligand-dependent transcription factors that share two conserved domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). In order to gain further insight into the evolution of metamorphosis and gene regulation by ecdysone in arthropods, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of both partners of the heterodimer ECR/USP-RXR. Overall, 38 USP-RXR and 19 ECR protein sequences, from 33 species, have been used for this analysis. Interestingly, sequence alignments and structural comparisons reveal high divergence rates, for both ECR and USP-RXR, specifically among Diptera and Lepidoptera. The most impressive differences affect the ligand-binding domain of USP-RXR. In addition, ECR sequences show variability in other domains, namely the DNA-binding and the carboxy-terminal F domains. Our data provide the first evidence that ECR and USP-RXR may have coevolved during holometabolous insect diversification, leading to a functional divergence of the ecdysone receptor. These results have general implications on fundamental aspects of insect development, evolution of nuclear receptors, and the design of specific insecticides.	0

10449595	Do memory complaints indicate the presence of cognitive impairment? Results of a field study. BACKGROUND: In the context of suspected cognitive disorders, the validity of memory complaints is subject to considerable debate. This investigation documents the prevalence of memory complaints and assesses the validity of memory complaints for detecting cognitive impairment. METHODS: The sample comprises 349 randomly selected non-institutionalized individuals, aged 75 and over living in the city of Leipzig. Twenty individuals who suffer from moderate and severe dementia according to DSM-III-R were excluded. Memory complaints were measured by means of a single item question. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a wider range of cognitive tests which constitute the short neuropsychological battery of the SIDAM (Structured Interview for the Diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer type, Multi-infarct dementia and dementias of other etiology according to ICD-10 and DSM-III-R) were used to test cognitive performance. RESULTS: One in three individuals aged 75 and over complained about memory deficits. The MMSE is not significantly related to memory complaints, whereas poorer performance on 2 out of 8 tests regarding specific areas of cognitive function (immediate recall, short-term memory) were found to be significantly associated with memory complaints. Despite these statistically significant associations, it is shown that memory complaints do not have diagnostic validity in detecting cognitive impairment on the individual level. CONCLUSION: Memory self-assessment should not be used as a substitute measure of cognitive performance. Initiation of further diagnostic and therapeutic steps should be based on cognitive performance testing. Relaying solely on memory complaints would miss individuals in need and allocate resources to worried but cognitively healthy persons.	0
17833933	Skylab radar altimeter: short-wavelength perturbations detected in ocean surface profiles. Short-wavelength anomalies in sea surface topography, caused by the gravitational effects of major ocean bottom topographic features, have been detected by the radar altimeter aboard Skylab. Some features, such as deep ocean trenches, seamounts, and escarpments, displace the ocean surface by as much as 15 meters over 100-kilometer wavelengths. This experiment demonstrates the potential of satellite altimetry for determining the ocean geoid and for mapping major features of the ocean bottom.	0
23626913	Informatics as tool for quality improvement: rapid implementation of guidance for the management of chronic kidney disease in England as an exemplar. OBJECTIVES: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important cause of excess cardiovascular mortality and morbidity; as well as being associated with progression to end stage renal disease. This condition was largely unheard of in English primary care prior to the introduction of pay-for-performance targets for management in 2006. A realist review of how informatics has been a mechanism for national implementation of guidance for the improved management of CKD. METHODS: Realist review of context, the English National Health Service with a drive to implement explicit national quality standards; mechanism, the informatics infrastructure and its alignment with policy objectives; and outcomes are describe at the micro-data and messaging, meso-patient care and quality improvement initiatives, and marco-national policy levels. RESULTS: At the micro-level computerised medical records can be used to reliably identify people with CKD; though differences in creatinine assays, fluctuation in renal function, and errors in diabetes coding were less well understood. At the meso-level more aggressive management of blood pressure (BP) in individual patients appears to slow or reverse decline in renal function; technology can support case finding and quality improvement at the general practice level. At the macro-level informaticians can help ensure that leverage from informatics is incorporated in policy, and ecological investigations inform if there is any association with improved health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the right policy context informatics appears to be an enabler of rapid quality improvement. However, a causal relationship or generalisability of these findings has not been demonstrated.	0

16001350	[Portopulmonary hypertension]. Patients with portal hypertension may develop pulmonary complications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) or portopulmonary hypertension (PPHT). PPHT is defined as elevated pulmonary pressure, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and portal hypertension in the absence of other known causes pulmonary hypertension. Various factors such as hyperdynamic circulation, volume overload, and circulating vasoactive mediators are suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of PPHT. The prognosis of patients with severe PPHT is significantly reduced due to the risk of right heart failure. In patients with moderate to severe PPHT liver transplantation is associated with a significantly increased mortality. The chief symptom of PPHT may be dyspnoe in the presence of typical histomorphological alterations comparable with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Continuous intravenous application of prostacyclin is currently regarded as the treatment of choice for patients with severe PPHT. Inhaled prostacyclin or its analogue iloprost or oral treatment with the endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be promising alternatives which should be further investigated in randomized controlled trials.	0
18838434	Isolation and biochemical characterization of two forms of RD21 from cotyledons of daikon radish (Raphanus sativus). RD21 (Responsive to desiccation-21) is an Arabidopsis cysteine protease which possesses a granulin-like domain at the C-terminus. Although two forms of RD21 have been identified, consisting of an intermediate form (iRD21) containing a granulin domain and a mature form (mRD21) lacking this domain, the enzymatic properties of these enzymes remain poorly understood. In this study, mRD21 orthologue was purified to homogeneity from the cotyledons of daikon radish (Raphanus sativus). RD21 preferentially cleaved peptide bond that had an aromatic or hydrophobic amino acid at the P2 position. Furthermore, the presence of a polar amino acid at the P1 position enhanced the cleavage susceptibility of the peptide bond, although the importance of the type of amino acid residue at the P1 and P1' positions was not as significant as the residue located at the P2 position. The iRD21 was also identified as an oligomeric form by gel filtration and sedimentation analyses. The expression of RD21 mRNA was initiated by imbibition and continued at almost constant levels during germination. On the other hand, the enzyme activity increased markedly 5 days after imbibition. These results indicate that this elevation of RD21 activity is generated post-transcriptionally.	0
19030598	Polymerization of polypyrrole on single crystal platinum electrodes: a surface structure sensitive reaction. This communication shows experimental results that clearly demonstrated the influence of the crystalline surface structure of the platinum electrode on the early stages of the electropolymerization of pyrrole in aqueous media. The platinum surface structure determines adhesion, coverage level, charge transfer properties as well as bulk properties of the synthesized film like morphology and the ion exchange kinetics during its reduction and oxidation. It is proven that the Pt(110) an Pt(111) surfaces are more suitable for obtain polypyrrole films with higher conductivity and charge-storage capacity than the Pt(100) surface.	0
18297060	MesP1 drives vertebrate cardiovascular differentiation through Dkk-1-mediated blockade of Wnt-signalling. ES-cell-based cardiovascular repair requires an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of cardiovascular ES cells. A candidate cardiovascular-fate inducer is the bHLH transcription factor MesP1. As one of the earliest markers, it is expressed specifically in almost all cardiovascular precursors and is required for cardiac morphogenesis. Here we show that MesP1 is a key factor sufficient to induce the formation of ectopic heart tissue in vertebrates and increase cardiovasculogenesis by ES cells. Electrophysiological analysis showed all subtypes of cardiac ES-cell differentiation. MesP1 overexpression and knockdown experiments revealed a prominent function of MesP1 in a gene regulatory cascade, causing Dkk-1-mediated blockade of canonical Wnt-signalling. Independent evidence from ChIP and in vitro DNA-binding studies, expression analysis in wild-type and MesP knockout mice, and reporter assays confirm that Dkk-1 is a direct target of MesP1. Further analysis of the regulatory networks involving MesP1 will be required to preprogramme ES cells towards a cardiovascular fate for cell therapy and cardiovascular tissue engineering. This may also provide a tool to elicit cardiac transdifferentiation in native human adult stem cells.	1

15951824	Accelerated CD8+ T-cell memory and prime-boost response after dendritic-cell vaccination. Efficient boosting of memory T-cell numbers to protective levels generally requires a relatively long interval between immunizations. Decreasing this interval could be crucial in biodefense and cancer immunotherapy, in which rapid protective responses are essential. Here, we show that vaccination with peptide-coated dendritic cells (DCs) generated CD8+ T cells with the phenotype and function of memory cells within 4-6 d. These early memory CD8+ T cells underwent vigorous secondary expansion in response to a variety of booster immunizations, leading to elevated numbers of effector and memory T cells and enhanced protective immunity. Coinjection of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, potent inducers of inflammation that did not alter the duration of DC antigen display, prevented the rapid generation of memory T cells in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking the interferon (IFN)-gamma receptor. These data show that DC vaccination stimulates a pathway of accelerated generation of memory T cells, and suggest that events of inflammation, including the action of IFN-gamma on the responding T cells, control the rate of development of memory CD8+ T cells.	0
15556706	Identification, distribution pattern of IS231 elements in Bacillus thuringiensis and their phylogenetic analysis. In order to better understand the fundamental biology of Bacillus thuringiensis, a single oligonucleotide primer (5'-CATSSCCATCAASYTAAVR-3') was used to investigate the distribution pattern of IS231 elements in B. thuringiensis by PCR. The results indicated that IS231 elements appeared in 20 standard strains and 107 of 111 China isolates. Three novel IS231, IS231J, IS231O and IS231Q, five variants and a mobile insertion cassette MICBth4 were cloned from eight standard strains of B. thuringiensis, respectively. Interestingly, BLAST analysis revealed that the 5' end of novel IS231J shared 99% identity in 495-bp with a DNA segment adjacent to the 3' end of B. thuringiensis vip1Ac gene (GenBank Accession No. ). Two phylogenetic trees of IS231 elements were constructed and analyzed by neighbor-joining and UPGMA methods from PHYLIP 3.6b program, respectively.	0
18157966	Clinical outcomes after heterogeneous overlap stenting with drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents for de novo coronary artery narrowings. When it is difficult to deliver multiple drug-eluting stents (DES) or when size constraints limit DES implantation, bare-metal stents (BMS) may be implanted contiguous to DES. However, the clinical outcomes after overlapping DES and BMS implantation are not known. From September 2004 to June 2006, 4,872 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention consented to be enrolled in a prospective registry. Of these patients, 44 (0.9%) with de novo lesions were treated with DES and BMS overlap stenting. All patients were followed to 12 months for the assessment of clinical outcomes. The average implanted stent diameter was 2.68 +/- 0.30 mm for DES and 2.35 +/- 0.38 mm for BMS. Overlapping BMS were implanted distal to DES in all but 1 case. One patient (2.3%) experienced acute stent thrombosis and died 2 days after the procedure. No other patient died or had a myocardial infarction during 12 months. The target vessel revascularization rate at 12 months, however, was 31.8%, mainly driven by diffuse in-stent restenosis in the BMS segments. In conclusion, the incidence of DES and BMS overlap stenting is rare in daily practice, but this procedure is associated with a high rate of target vessel revascularization.	0
15671917	How and when to use an alternative site in self-monitoring of blood glucose. Taking care of diabetic patients has considerably been improved for approximately fifty years both in the therapeutic field and in the glycaemia monitoring field. Prospective studies conducted on large cohorts have clearly shown the importance of taking optimal care of such patients in order to prevent the occurrence or aggravation of chronic diabetes-associated complications. However, despite the simplification of self-monitoring of blood glucose through technological developments, drawbacks, some of which are linked to the sampling site, the fingertip, still slow down the patients' compliance. The use of an alternative site seems to be one of the solutions to offer in order to improve their monitoring and hence, their metabolic control. The development of such a monitoring mode has been slowed down after revealing, in some studies, a probably physiological delay in the detection of glycaemia variations, at the level of the alternative sites. Despite such conflicting observations, interest of using such alternative sites is to be defined in self-monitoring. Beside fast glycaemia variations, it proved to be reliable.	0

24454434	Immunoproteomic Analysis of the Excretory-Secretory Proteins from Spirometra mansoni Sparganum. BACKGROUND: Sparganosis is caused by the invasion of Spirometra sparganum into various tissues/organs. Subcutaneous sparganosis can be diagnosed by biopsy, while visceral/cerebral sparganosis is not easy to be diagnosed. The diagnosis depends largely on the detection of specific anti-sparganum antibodies. The specificity of the ELISA could be increased by using S. mansoni sparganum excretory-secretory (ES) antigens, but it also had the cross-reactions with sera of patients with cysticercosis or paragonimiasis. The aim of this study was to identify early specific diagnostic antigens in S. mansoni sparganum ES proteins. METHODS: The sparganum ES proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and Western blot probed with early sera from infected mice at 14 days post-infection. The immunoreactive protein spots were characterized by MALDI-TOF/ TOF-MS. RESULTS: A total of approximately 149 proteins spots were detected with isoelectric point (pI) varying from 3 to 7.5 and molecular weight from 20 to 115 kDa and seven protein spots with molecular weight of 23-31 kDa were recognized by the infection sera. Three of seven spots were successfully identified and characterized as the same S. mansoni protein (cysteine protease), and the proteins of other 4 spots were not included in the databases. CONCLUSION: The cysteine protease from S. mansoni ES proteins recognized by early infection sera might be the early diagnostic antigens for sparganosis.	0
9725923	Spontaneous initiation of atrial fibrillation by ectopic beats originating in the pulmonary veins. BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and a major cause of stroke, results from simultaneous reentrant wavelets. Its spontaneous initiation has not been studied. METHODS: We studied 45 patients with frequent episodes of atrial fibrillation (mean [+/-SD] duration, 344+/-326 minutes per 24 hours) refractory to drug therapy. The spontaneous initiation of atrial fibrillation was mapped with the use of multielectrode catheters designed to record the earliest electrical activity preceding the onset of atrial fibrillation and associated atrial ectopic beats. The accuracy of the mapping was confirmed by the abrupt disappearance of triggering atrial ectopic beats after ablation with local radio-frequency energy. RESULTS: A single point of origin of atrial ectopic beats was identified in 29 patients, two points of origin were identified in 9 patients, and three or four points of origin were identified in 7 patients, for a total of 69 ectopic foci. Three foci were in the right atrium, 1 in the posterior left atrium, and 65 (94 percent) in the pulmonary veins (31 in the left superior, 17 in the right superior, 11 in the left inferior, and 6 in the right inferior pulmonary vein). The earliest activation was found to have occurred 2 to 4 cm inside the veins, marked by a local depolarization preceding the atrial ectopic beats on the surface electrocardiogram by 106+/-24 msec. Atrial fibrillation was initiated by a sudden burst of rapid depolarizations (340 per minute). A local depolarization could also be recognized during sinus rhythm and abolished by radiofrequency ablation. During a follow-up period of 8+/-6 months after ablation, 28 patients (62 percent) had no recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

Pyrenebutanoate, a fluorescent amphiphilic probe, is suggested here as a capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) buffer additive for dynamic modification and analysis of microbial cells. Mixed cultures of microorganisms Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were concentrated, resolved by CZE and detected. Using UV excitation for on-column fluorometric detection, a detection sensitivity for the microorganisms on the order of from one to tens of injected cells was achieved.	0
24264176	Effect of zinc deficiency on the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine in rat microsomes. Phosphatidylcholine is the major lipid of all cellular membranes. Phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in microsomes involves two enzyme pathways, choline phosphotransferase and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine methyltransferase. The present study was designed to examine the effect of zinc deficiency on these two enzymes. Male, weanling Long-Evans rats were fed a biotin-enriched 20% egg white diet deficient in zinc for 15-45 d. The specific activity (pmol phosphatidylcholine formed/min/mg microsomal protein) of choline phosphotransferase, phsophatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, and phos-phatidyldimethylethanolamine methyltransferase was determined. The latter assay measures the third methylation of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. Zinc deficiency resulted in a significant increase over controls in the specific activity of phospha-tidylethanolamine methyltransferase and phosphatidyldimethyl-ethanolamine methyltransferase in liver and spleen microsomes. A significant increase in the picomoles of phosphatidylcholine formed by the choline phosphotransferase pathway occurred in liver microsomes of zinc-deficient animals. In the brain microsomes a significant decrease in specific activity of phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine methyltransferase, and choline phosphotransferase occurred among zinc-deficient ani-mals. These data suggest that zinc deficiency alters the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the major lipid of cellular membranes.	0
7236633	Spectral and functional comparisons between the carotenoids of the two antenna complexes of Rhodopseudomonas capsulata. The spectral and functional properties of carotenoids associated with each of the two light-harvesting complexes of the Rhodopseudomonas capsulata photosynthetic antenna system have been distinguished by studying mutants lacking one or the other complex. In mutants containing only the light-harvesting I complex (LH-I), the absorption spectrum of the carotenoids is blue-shifted compared to wild type. Carotenoid absorption in mutants possessing only the light-harvesting II complex (LH-II) complex is red-shifted. The circular dichroism spectrum of carotenoids in each complex is also distinctive. Although carotenoids in each complex function with approximately the same efficiency in harvesting and transmitting light energy for photosynthesis, only the carotenoids associated with LH-II undergo an electrochromic bandshift upon generation of a transmembrane potential. These observations are interpreted to indicate that both the orientation of carotenoid molecules with respect to the plane of the membrane, and the immediate electrochemical environment of these molecules differ in the two light-harvesting complexes.	0
12914041	Synthesis of mesoporous silica monoliths with embedded nanoparticles. Mesostructured silica-nanoparticle monolithic composites have been synthesized by dispersing prefabricated nanoparticles of gold or zeolite (silicalite) in ethanolic reaction mixtures containing SiCl4 and a Pluronic triblock copolymer template. Whereas silicalite nanoparticles were used directly, surface functionalization of the gold nanoparticles with either primed silicate ions or a discrete 3-5-nm-thick silica shell was required to increase the interfacial compatibility with the hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) blocks. Under these conditions, the resulting monoliths consisted of distributed nanoparticles within an ordered mesostructured silica matrix. Removal of the polymer template by calcination produced corresponding mesoporous silica-nanoparticle replicas. The combination of the structure and the porosity of the silica framework with the crystal chemical properties of the embedded nanoparticles suggests that such composites should be useful as multifunctional materials.	0
16022952	The site of plaque rupture in native coronary arteries: a three-vessel intravascular ultrasound analysis. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the axial location of plaque ruptures in native coronary arteries. BACKGROUND: It is clinically important to understand the potential sites of plaque rupture. METHODS: We performed three-vessel intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examination in 392 patients; 231 had acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 161 had stable angina pectoris (SAP). The IVUS detected plaque ruptures in 206 patients: 158 ACS patients and 48 SAP patients. The distance between each coronary plaque rupture segment and the respective coronary ostium was measured with motorized IVUS transducer pullback in all three coronary arteries. RESULTS: There were a total of 273 plaque ruptures in these 206 patients; 143 in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), 40 in the left circumflex artery (LCX), and 90 in the right coronary artery (RCA). There were 67 plaque ruptures in SAP patients and 206 in ACS patients; there were 197 culprit/target lesion plaque ruptures and 76 non-culprit/non-target lesion plaque ruptures. The LAD plaque ruptures were predominantly located between 10 and 40 mm from the LAD ostium (83%, 119 of 143). The LCX plaque ruptures were evenly distributed in the entire LCX tree. Most RCA plaque ruptures were located in segments between 10 and 40 mm (48%, 43 of 90) and in segments >70 mm from the ostium (32%, 29 of 90). CONCLUSIONS: Three-vessel IVUS imaging showed that plaque ruptures occurred mainly in proximal segments of the LAD (83% of LAD plaque rupture), the proximal and distal segments of the RCA (48% and 32% of RCA plaque ruptures, respectively), and the entire LCX.	0
8417192	Osseous fixation of a penile prosthesis after transsexual phalloplasty: a case report. We report on a patient who had undergone female-to-male transsexual surgery and subsequent phalloplasty by means of a free latissimus dorsi muscle graft with pudendal nerve coaptation elsewhere 10 years ago. The surgical strategy for implantation and osseous fixation of a penile prosthesis is described. We discuss whether the primary implantation of a penile prosthesis during 1-stage surgical phalloplasty is more advantageous in comparison with the currently favored secondary implantation. Phalloplasty should be represented by a 1-stage surgical procedure encompassing the creation of a neourethra, restoration of tactile and possibly erogenous sensibility, and implantation of a penile prosthesis. The result should have aesthetic value and be pleasing to the patient.	0
7673717	Intramolecular mimicry. Identification and analysis of two cross-reactive T cell epitopes within a single protein. The recognition of peptide Ags by T cells through the TCR has exquisite specificity. Cross-reactive T cell responses have been described; however, the structural basis for these responses is not known. We show that two peptides derived from the same protein can exhibit sufficient structural homology, despite minimal structural identity, to elicit cross-reactive T cell responses. In addition, we explore the structural basis for cross-reactivity. T cell hybridomas recognizing PiM and PiZ allelic forms of human alpha 1-antitrypsin (hAAT) each recognized both PiM 205-220 and PiM 335-350. These two peptides possessed primary sequence identity at only two of 16 amino acid residues. Cross-reactive peptides also exhibited homology at the bulk T cell level because lymph node T cells primed with one peptide proliferated to the other peptide in vitro. Critical amino acids for the responding T cells were determined, and the core was transferred into the less reactive peptide in an attempt to increase homology by increasing sequence identity. Interestingly, as identity increased, homology decreased: peptides with the least primary sequence identity appeared most homologous to the T cells. These results have important implications for understanding the development of autoimmune diseases, and imply that minimal obvious primary sequence identity may be sufficient to initiate cross-reactive T cell responses. The ability of structurally dissimilar peptides to mimic each other when bound to a class II MHC molecule may also be important to the understanding of T development and autoimmunity.	0
21868137	Pyrazol-3-propanoic acid derivatives as novel inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis in human neutrophils. We recently presented that compounds 4a-b moderately inhibited leukotriene (LT) formation in human neutrophils. For structural derivatization of 4a-b, novel thirty-six title compounds were synthesized and led to more potent inhibition of LT biosynthesis in activated human neutrophils exemplified by compounds 15, 27-30, 32-37, 41, 42 with IC(50) values in the range of 1.6-3.5  M. Moreover, compounds 32, 35, 42, 43 and 44 showed a substantial inhibition of platelet COX-1 activity with IC(50) of 2.5, 0.041, 0.3, 0.9 and 0.014  M, respectively, leading up to dual acting inhibitors. On the basis of their high potency in cellular environment, these straightforward pyrazole-3-propanoic acid derivatives may possess potential in the design of more potent compounds for intervention with inflammatory and allergic diseases.	0

21347885	Semantic clustering as a neuropsychological predictor for amnestic-MCI. Recent research has demonstrated that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show deficits in semantic processing when compared to cognitively healthy individuals. This difference is thought to be attributed to losses in higher cortical systems that are predominantly associated with executive functioning. The first aim of the study will be to determine if differences in semantic clustering can accurately differentiate patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) from cognitively normal (CN) individuals. The second aim will be to determine the extent to which semantic processing might be associated with executive functions. Data from 202 (134 CN, 68 aMCI) participants were analyzed to quantify differences in semantic clustering ratios on the HVLT-R. Study participants ages ranged from 51 to 87 with education ranging from 6 to 20 years. ANCOVA revealed statistically significant differences on semantic clustering ratios (p < .001). Moderate correlations between semantic clustering Category Fluency Test (r = .45) were also found. Statistically significant group differences were also present on Trails-B and WAIS-R Digit Symbol performance (p < .001). Overall, these data indicate that deficits in semantic clustering are present in aMCI patients.	0

12692619	Availability of unrelated donors for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for hemoglobinopathies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option for patients with hemoglobinopathies. However, fewer than 30% of individuals will have an HLA-identical sibling. Improvement in outcomes after HSCT using unrelated donors (URD), and the development of novel nontoxic preparative regimens may make URD HSCT an option for hemoglobinopathy patients who do not have an HLA-identical sibling donor. The National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) maintains a Registry of 4 million volunteer donors, and facilitates URD HSCT for patients with life-threatening blood diseases. In light of the increased representation of minorities in the NMDP registry, donor searches were run in April 2001 for a cohort of 272 thalassemia patients and 77 sickle cell disease (SCD) patients for whom searches had been submitted between 1989 and 2001 in order to determine the current likelihood of finding a potential donor of hematopoietic stem cells for hemoglobinopathy patients. About 59.7% SCD patients 80.2% thalassemia patients will find at least one potential 6/6 HLA matched donor or umbilical cord blood (UCB) unit. All patients will find at least one donor or UCB that is a potential 5/6 HLA match. In conclusion the majority of hemoglobinopathy patients will find at least one potential HLA matched unrelated bone marrow donor or UCB.	0
16912241	Secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease: focus on clinical consequences and vitamin D therapies. OBJECTIVE: To assess vitamin D-based treatment approaches for secondary hyperparathyroidism and its complications. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE (1990-February 28, 2006). Key words used were chronic kidney disease and vitamin D to identify relevant papers published in English. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: From the database of articles generated, 48 papers were identified. Titles and abstracts were examined to identify those directly related to the objective. Discussion was expanded through the bibliographies of cited articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the US indicates an urgent need for treatment strategies to delay or prevent disease progression. Abnormalities in phosphorus and calcium homeostasis, vitamin D levels, and the subsequent development of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) are secondary complications of CKD associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Management options include dietary phosphorus restriction, phosphate binders and/or calcium supplementation, vitamin D supplementation, and calcimimetics. Vitamin D supplementation has received increased attention given the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with CKD and the beneficial effect of correcting this deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification and intervention appropriate to the stage of CKD are likely to improve patient outcomes. Improved knowledge of interactions between vitamin D and vitamin D receptors has led to the development of vitamin D analogs and calcimimetics, which offer benefits in the management of SHPT. Integrating available treatment options into practice to achieve optimal therapeutic goals of SHPT based on the stage of CKD is a significant challenge for pharmacists managing patients with CKD.	0
8321719	[The relationships between the degrees of oxygenation and the serum calcitonin levels in the term newborn]. The authors have studied the correlations between serum levels of calcitonin and the degree of oxygenation assessed by means of transcutaneous pO2 and pCO2 and capillary pH in 40 term newborns of adequate birth weight. Highly significant correlations (P < 0.001) were found at the 24th hour of life between calcitonin levels and the asphyxia parametres and between the latter measured at the 12th or the 24th hour and calcitonin levels found respectively at the 24th or the 48th hour. Similar correlations were found subdividing the studied newborns with regard to the type of delivery. We conclude that the severity of neonatal asphyxia is indeed the main determining factor of the magnitude of the calcitonin hyperincretion.	0
23427093	New views on cellular uptake and trafficking of manufactured nanoparticles. Nanoparticles (NPs) are of similar size to typical cellular components and proteins, and can efficiently intrude living cells. A detailed understanding of the involved processes at the molecular level is important for developing NPs designed for selective uptake by specific cells, for example, for targeted drug delivery. In addition, this knowledge can greatly assist in the engineering of NPs that should not penetrate cells so as to avoid adverse health effects. In recent years, a wide variety of experiments have been performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cellular NP uptake. Here, we review some select recent studies, which are often based on fluorescence microscopy and sophisticated strategies for specific labelling of key cellular components. We address the role of the protein corona forming around NPs in biological environments, and describe recent work revealing active endocytosis mechanisms and pathways involved in their cellular uptake. Passive uptake is also discussed. The current state of knowledge is summarized, and we point to issues that still need to be addressed to further advance our understanding of cellular NP uptake.	0
23695320	Optical activity caused by torsion stresses: the case of NaBi(MoO4)2 crystals. We have found that torsion mechanical stresses induce the optical rotation effect in centrosymmetric NaBi(MoO4)2 crystals. We have suggested a description of the effect on the basis of nonlocal linear elasticity theory. It has been shown that the induced optical gyration is proportional to the stress gradient appearing due to the torsion.	0
22888839	Flavonoids and cancer prevention: a review of the evidence. The objective of this work is to review data from epidemiological and preclinical studies addressing the potential benefits of diets based on flavonoids for cancer prevention. Flavonoids are subdivided into subclasses including flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanidins, and isoflavones. Epidemiological studies suggest dietary intake of flavonoids may reduce the risk of tumors of the breast, colon, lung, prostate, and pancreas. However, some studies have reported inconclusive or even harmful associations. A major challenge in the interpretation of epidemiological studies is that most of the data originate from case-control studies and retrospective acquisition of flavonoid intake. Differences in agricultural, sociodemographics, and lifestyle factors contribute to the heterogeneity in the intake of flavonoids among populations residing in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Dose and timing of exposure may influence the anticancer response to flavonoid-rich diets. A limited number of intervention trials of flavonoids have documented cancer preventative effects. Proposed anticancer mechanisms for flavonoids are inhibition of proliferation, inflammation, invasion, metastasis, and activation of apoptosis. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to develop biomarkers of flavonoid intake and effect. Mechanistic studies are needed to ascertain how flavonoid-rich diets influence gene regulation for cancer prevention.	0
12635014	[Value of 14-gauge ultrasound-guided large-core needle biopsy of breast lesions: own results in comparison with the literature]. PURPOSE: To report the false-negative rate, sensitivity, and specificity of 14-gauge ultrasound-guided large-core needle biopsy (14-G USSB) performed on breast lesions at our institution and, furthermore, to compare and discuss our own results with those reported in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study includes 399 lesions examined by 14-G USSB. The results of the 14-G USSB were compared with the results of the surgical biopsy or, in cases of benign histology, were followed clinically. A key word search in two medical databases was undertaken to compare our data with those reported in the literature. The search was limited to the period from January 1990 to February 2002 and only original investigations published in English and German were included in our comparison. RESULTS: At our institution, 238 (59.6 %) benign and 161 (40.4 %) malignant lesions were diagnosed by 14-G USSB. The 14-G USSB was false-negative in 5 (1.25 %) of 399 cases. It has a sensitivity of 95.7 %, and specificity 100%. The literature reports false-negative rates between 0 % and 1.26 %, sensitivities between 86% and 100%, and specificities between 99.7 % and 100 %. On the basis of 3880 results from seven selected original papers and our own study, the false-negative rate for 14-G USSB was calculated to be 0.4 % (16 of 3880). CONCLUSION: Based on our results and those reported in the literature, 14-G USSB can be considered safe and reliable in the assessment of breast lesions.	0
17219014	Glycemic load, glycemic index, and carbohydrate intake in relation to pancreatic cancer risk in a large US cohort. BACKGROUND: Consumption of diets with high glycemic load has been hypothesized to increase pancreatic cancer risk by raising postprandial glucose levels and insulin secretion. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II) Nutrition Cohort to examine the association between pancreatic cancer and glycemic load, glycemic index (GI), and intake of carbohydrates. Diet was assessed among 124,907 men and women who were cancer-free and non-diabetic at baseline in 1992 using a validated 68-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). During 9 years of follow-up, 401 incident pancreatic cancer cases were identified. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compute hazard rate ratios (RR) adjusted for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: We found no association between glycemic load, GI, or carbohydrate intake and risk of pancreatic cancer in this population. The hazard rate ratio (RR) was 1.01 (95% CI 0.75-1.37, trend P=0.80) for glycemic load, 0.92 (95% CI 0.68-1.24) for GI, and 1.10 (95% CI 0.80-1.51) for carbohydrate intake among men and women in the highest quintile compared to the lowest quintile of each measure. We also found no significant association between these measures and pancreatic cancer risk among individuals who show a greater susceptibility towards insulin insensitivity, such as those who are overweight or more sedentary. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data do not support the hypothesis that glycemic load or index, or carbohydrate intake are associated with a substantial increase in pancreatic cancer risk; however, a weak positive association cannot be ruled out.	0
19920342	Looking at the origin of phenotypic variation from pattern formation gene networks. This article critically reviews some widespread views about the overall functioning of development. Special attention is devoted to views in developmental genetics about the superstructure of developmental gene networks. According to these views gene networks are hierarchic and multilayered. The highest layers partition the embryo in large coarse areas and control downstream genes that subsequently subdivide the embryo into smaller and smaller areas. These views are criticized on the bases of developmental and evolutionary arguments. First, these views, although detailed at the level of gene identities, do not incorporate morphogenetic mechanisms nor do they try to explain how morphology changes during development. Often, they assume that morphogenetic mechanisms are subordinate to cell signaling events. This is in contradiction to the evidence reviewed herein. Experimental evidence on pattern formation also contradicts the view that developmental gene networks are hierarchically multilayered and that their functioning is decodable from promoter analysis. Simple evolutionary arguments suggest that, indeed, developmental gene networks tend to be non-hierarchic. Re-use leads to extensive modularity in gene networks while developmental drift blurs this modularity. Evolutionary opportunism makes developmental gene networks very dependent on epigenetic factors.	0

21792529	[Psychotropic drugs and diabetes]. Psychotropic drugs, such as antipsychotics and antidepressants, are widely used substances which can display marked metabolic side effects. Psychiatric patients display increased morbidity and mortality which, besides disease specific factors, may be attributed to metabolic side effects of psychotropic drugs. Commonly observed side effects of antipsychotics are weight gain as well as disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism. Additionally, antipsychotics have been shown to increase diabetes risk. Also, the use of some of the antidepressant substances is associated with an increased diabetes risk. However, large inter-substance variations have been observed. Conversely, diabetics have an increased risk of depression. Metabolic side effects of psychotropic drugs pose a serious impairment for psychiatric patients and their management can play a pivotal role in therapeutic compliance and success. This review aims to give an overview of metabolic side effects of commonly used psychotic drugs and to give an insight into possible underlying mechanisms.	0

21338884	Rab3-GAP controls the progression of synaptic homeostasis at a late stage of vesicle release. Homeostatic signaling systems stabilize neural function through the modulation of neurotransmitter receptor abundance, ion channel density, and presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Molecular mechanisms that drive these changes are being unveiled. In theory, molecular mechanisms may also exist to oppose the induction or expression of homeostatic plasticity, but these mechanisms have yet to be explored. In an ongoing electrophysiology-based genetic screen, we have tested 162 new mutations for genes involved in homeostatic signaling at the Drosophila NMJ. This screen identified a mutation in the rab3-GAP gene. We show that Rab3-GAP is necessary for the induction and expression of synaptic homeostasis. We then provide evidence that Rab3-GAP relieves an opposing influence on homeostasis that is catalyzed by Rab3 and which is independent of any change in NMJ anatomy. These data define roles for Rab3-GAP and Rab3 in synaptic homeostasis and uncover a mechanism, acting at a late stage of vesicle release, that opposes the progression of homeostatic plasticity.	0
12744824	Hirschsprung's Disease. Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is the most common congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system and requires early diagnosis and surgical repair for the best comprehensive outcome. The early diagnosis of this disorder permits the use of primary endorectal pull-through (PERPT), which is now the definitive surgical therapy for HSCR. PERPT has become the preferred method of treatment for HSCR, and large numbers of successfully treated patients have been described in the recent medical literature. The rate of postoperative complications is generally similar to that following a two-stage surgical repair, but PERPT patients may be at a slightly higher risk for Hirschsprung's-associated enterocolitis. Despite recent surgical advances in the treatment of HSCR, a two-stage surgical repair involving a temporary diverting colostomy may still be necessary in up to one third of patients. Candidates for a staged repair include those HSCR patients with long-segment or total colonic disease or when there has been a delay in diagnosis that results in a markedly dilated proximal colon or patient clinical instability. Internal anal sphincter hypertonicity, occurring either as isolated primary anal achalasia or as a postoperative complication, can be successfully managed by either botulinum toxin injections or anal myectomy. The measurement of colonic motility in surgically repaired patients with a long-standing postoperative abnormality of bowel function can identify several distinct motility disorders that are amenable to separate and individualized therapies. The single most important element in the management of HSCR remains the clinical judgement of the surgeon of record, who utilizes all discernible clinical data to elect the manner of surgical repair in a given patient.	0
17500900	Microrheology of viscoelastic fluids containing light-scattering inclusions. The microrheology of viscoelastic fluids containing light-scattering inclusions is measured by depolarized dynamic light scattering (DDLS) from optically anisotropic spherical colloidal probes. The anisotropy of the probes allows us to measure both their translational and the rotational mean squared displacements simultaneously, and DDLS allows us to suppress the light scattered from the inclusions. The storage and loss moduli are determined from both mean squared displacements and the results compared with mechanical measurements.	0

22397390	Mild asthmatics benefit from music therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation with music therapy in patients with asthma. METHODS: Seventy-six selected inpatients (54 women and 22 men; mean age = 56.4 years; SD = 11.8) with stable asthma underwent pulmonary rehabilitation in two groups: standard versus music therapy. RESULTS: After the intervention, an increase in analyzed spirometric values (forced expiratory volume at the first second (FEV(1)), FEV(1) as a percentage of vital capacity (FEV(1) % FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25%, 50%, and 75% of vital capacity (FEF(25), FEF(50), and FEF(75), respectively), and peak expiratory flow) was observed in both the groups (p < .05) but without any intergroup differences (p > .05). A greater increase of mean FEV(1) % FVC, FEF(50), and FEF(75) values was observed only in the patients with mild asthma from the music therapy group (p < .05). In both the groups, a dyspnea reduction was noted (p < .001). However, it was influenced neither by the type of rehabilitation nor by the gender (p > .05), but the interaction of these variables was significant (p = .044). A dyspnea reduction was observed in women in both the groups (p < .001) and in men in the music therapy group only (p = .001). A change in the value of anxiety (6.43, SD = 7.73) on the 10th day compared with the first day of the study was noticed (p < .001). However, this change was not influenced by the type of rehabilitation, gender, or a combination of these two variables (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Music therapy improves the respiratory function in patients with mild asthma and reduces dyspnea mainly in men with asthma.	0

14694419	Determination of ampicillin and amoxycillin by flow injection chemiluminescence method based on their enhancing effects on the luminol-periodate reaction. In this work, a new flow injection chemiluminescence method is described for the determination of ampicillin and amoxycillin. The method is based on the strong enhancing effects of these antibiotics on the luminol-periodate reaction. The present method allows the measurements of ampicillin in the range 0.02-1.0 mg/L range and amoxycillin in the range 0.1-10.0 mg/L range with the relative standard deviations within 0.8-2.0%. The sampling frequency was calculated about 90/h. The method was successfully applied to the determination of ampicillin and amoxycillin in pharmaceutical preparations. A brief discussion on the possible chemiluminescence reaction mechanism is presented.	0

12552205	Ketamine and midazolam differentially inhibit nonadrenergic noncholinergic lower esophageal sphincter relaxation in rabbits: role of superoxide anion and nitric oxide synthase. BACKGROUND: The authors previously reported that ketamine and midazolam inhibited nitric oxide-mediated nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation nitric oxide-3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway modulation. The mechanisms inhibiting the NANC relaxation by ketamine and midazolam were investigated. METHODS: The isometric tension of circular distal esophageal muscle strips from Japanese White rabbits was examined. NANC relaxation was induced by KCl (30 mm) in the presence of atropine (3 x 10(-6) m) and guanethidine (3 x 10(-6) m). Nitric oxide synthase activity in the absence and presence of ketamine and midazolam was analyzed using the biochemical conversion of L-[3H]arginine to L-[3H]citrulline. RESULTS: The ketamine-induced inhibition of the NANC relaxation was partly reversed by superoxide dismutase (200, 400 U/ml) but not by catalase (100 U/ml). Ketamine concentration-dependently inhibited the relaxation induced by N-ethylethanamine:1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine (diethylamine NONOate) and S-nitrosoglutathione. The NANC relaxation itself was not affected by superoxide dismutase. The midazolam-induced inhibition of the NANC relaxation was reversed neither by superoxide dismutase nor by catalase, and midazolam did not affect the relaxations induced by nitric oxide donors. The nitric oxide synthase activity was concentration-dependently suppressed by midazolam, but there was no marked effect of ketamine. Pyrogallol, a superoxide generator, inhibited the NANC and the diethylamine NONOate-induced relaxations. The pyrogallol-induced inhibition of the NANC relaxation was reversed by superoxide dismutase. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that ketamine inhibits NANC LES relaxation by the extracellular production of superoxide anion, and that midazolam inhibits it by the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity.	0

15083258	Transient disruption of attentional performance following escalating amphetamine administration in rats. RATIONALE: Attentional deficits are thought to be critically involved in the development of positive symptoms in schizophrenia. The present experiment tests the general hypothesis that sensitization of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system contributes to the attentional deficits in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: The present study assessed attentional performance following administration of an escalating amphetamine regimen and subsequent \"challenge\" amphetamine administration in rats. METHODS: Rats were trained to perform a two-lever sustained attention task that involved discrimination of visual signals and no signal presentation. After reaching criterion, subjects were assigned to receive escalating amphetamine or saline. Attentional performance was assessed immediately following escalating amphetamine, following \"challenge\" amphetamine administration (1.0 mg/kg) to amphetamine-pretreated rats, and for 3 days after the challenge session. At the end of this experiment, a dose-response study was conducted with saline-pretreated rats to confirm the appropriateness of the challenge dose. RESULTS: Amphetamine-pretreated animals demonstrated a transient increase in errors on nonsignal trials following escalating amphetamine administration. The latency to press a lever was decreased during and after challenge amphetamine administration. Administration of 1.0 mg/kg amphetamine did not alter accuracy of amphetamine-pretreated animals or of saline-pretreated animals in the dose-response experiment. CONCLUSIONS: Prior escalating amphetamine administration transiently disrupted attention, increasing incorrect \"claims\" for a signal on trials when no signal was presented. The present data support the existing literature that escalating amphetamine regimens may be useful to model the attentional deficits that contribute to the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.	0
24045951	The Rho family member RhoE interacts with Skp2 and is degraded at the proteasome during cell cycle progression. RhoE/Rnd3 is an atypical member of the Rho family of small GTPases. In addition to regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics, RhoE is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. We examined RhoE expression levels during cell cycle and investigated mechanisms controlling them. We show that RhoE accumulates during G1, in contact-inhibited cells, and when the Akt pathway is inhibited. Conversely, RhoE levels rapidly decrease at the G1/S transition and remain low for most of the cell cycle. We also show that the half-life of RhoE is shorter than that of other Rho proteins and that its expression levels are regulated by proteasomal degradation. The expression patterns of RhoE overlap with that of the cell cycle inhibitor p27. Consistently with an involvement of RhoE in cell cycle regulation, RhoE and p27 levels decrease after overexpression of the F-box protein Skp2. We have identified a region between amino acids 231 and 240 of RhoE as the Skp2-interacting domain and Lys(235) as the substrate for ubiquitylation. Based on our results, we propose a mechanism according to which proteasomal degradation of RhoE by Skp2 regulates its protein levels to control cellular proliferation.	0

20427993	Pathophysiology of fluid retention in heart failure. BACKGROUND: Fluid retention in the face of an expanding extracellular fluid volume is a key contributing factor in the development and progression of heart failure. METHODS: We performed a review of clinical texts as well as a Medline investigation for the pathophysiology of fluid and sodium retention in heart failure. RESULTS: A breakdown in the integrity of the arterial circulation, seen in both high and low output heart failure, triggers a complex cascade of maladaptive events in an effort to maintain cardiorenal homeostasis. The activation of several neurohumoral mechanisms including the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, nonosmotic arginine vasopressin release, and natriuretic peptide release initially compensates for depressed myocardial function. However, prolonged activation of these systems contributes to sodium and fluid retention, increased preload and afterload, and further damage to the myocardium. Improved understanding of this multifaceted pathophysiology has driven the development of improved treatment modalities, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors which are now mainstays of heart failure therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation into the neurohumoral mechanisms activated in the heart failure patient is a promising avenue for advances in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this prevalent and devastating disease.	0
21968947	Autoantibodies to estrogen receptor a interfere with T lymphocyte homeostasis and are associated with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus. OBJECTIVE: Estrogens influence many physiologic processes and are also implicated in the development or progression of numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders. Aberrations of lymphocyte homeostasis that lead to the production of multiple pathogenic autoantibodies, including autoantibodies specific to estrogen receptor (ER), have been detected in the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study was undertaken to assess the presence of both anti-ERa and anti-ERb antibodies in sera from patients with SLE, to analyze the effect of these antibodies on peripheral blood T lymphocyte homeostasis, and to evaluate their role as determinants of disease pathogenesis and progression. METHODS: Anti-ER antibody serum immunoreactivity was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 86 patients with SLE and 95 healthy donors. Phenotypic and functional analyses were performed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. RESULTS: Anti-ERa antibodies were present in 45% of the patients with SLE, whereas anti-ERb antibodies were undetectable. In healthy donors, anti-ERa antibodies induced cell activation and consequent apoptotic cell death in resting lymphocytes as well as proliferation of anti-CD3-stimulated T lymphocytes. A significant association between anti-ERa antibody values and clinical parameters, i.e., the SLE Disease Activity Index and arthritis, was found. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that anti-ERa autoantibodies interfere with T lymphocyte homeostasis and are significantly associated with lupus disease activity.	0

9401890	Trends in the health burden due to urinary tract infection in children in Australia. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the health burden of urinary tract infection in children less than 15 years of age in Australia and to ascertain whether any significant change has occurred during the past decade. METHODOLOGY: The number of children less than 15 years of age who were admitted in New South Wales for urinary tract infection between 1981 and 1994 was ascertained from the Department of Health, and age and sex specific incidence rates were calculated using Australian Bureau of Statistics population data. Costs for inpatient care were calculated using the cost weights from Australia National Disease Related Groups Version 3 for urinary tract infection (DRG 577). The frequency of the four most commonly requested renal tract imaging procedures in children following urinary tract infection and which qualified for Medicare reimbursement were obtained from the Health Insurance Commission for 1984-1994: micturating cystourethrography, intravenous urography, renal ultrasonography, and nuclear medicine renal studies. RESULTS: There were 1203 children who were admitted with urinary tract infection in New South Wales in 1994, at an estimated cost of  A1.6 million. Since 1981, the age standardized annual incidence of urinary tract infection requiring hospitalization has increased from 0.5 to 0.9 per 1000 children, largely because of an increase in the number of young children admitted (from 0.6 to 2.0 per 1000 children less than 5 years of age). In 1994, 46,230 non-inpatient renal imaging procedures were undertaken in children under 15 years of age at a cost of  A5.3 million. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract infection is an important and increasing health problem for Australian children, particularly for preschool children. Whether this represents a true increase in the incidence of urinary tract infection or improved diagnosis and more intensive management is not possible to establish with this study design. Prospective population based studies are required to assess more completely the frequency with which urinary tract infection occurs in children and any changes that may be occurring.	0
16166967	Optical technologies for cervical neoplasia: update of an NCI program project grant. Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide and the leading cause of cancer mortality in women in developing countries. In the United States, over  6 billion is spent annually in the evaluation and treatment of low-grade lesions, many of which do not develop into full-blown cancer. In developing countries, however, the chief concern is that cervical cancer goes undetected because of the cost of testing and the lack of resources and trained personnel to screen and diagnose the disease. The goal of the National Cancer Institute Program Project Grant CA82710 is to assess the emerging technologies of fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy and quantitative cytology and histopathology for the diagnosis of cervical neoplasia. All of these technologies should decrease mortality, morbidity, and the cost of treating cervical cancer.	0
10211971	Use of the baculovirus system to assemble polyomavirus capsid-like particles with different polyomavirus structural proteins: analysis of the recombinant assembled capsid-like particles. The genes encoding the structural proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) of murine polyomavirus were cloned into the p2Bac dual multiple cloning site vector, individually or jointly, and the corresponding proteins were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells by cotransfecting Sf9 cells with the constructed vector and the linear DNA of Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV). Recombinant capsid-like particles could be purified 5 days post-infection from Sf9 cells infected with AcMNPV-VP1, with or without the involvement of minor protein (VP2 or VP3). Although VP2 and VP3 alone could not generate recombinant particles, they became incorporated into these particles when expressed with VP1 in Sf9 cells. Recombinant particles with different polyomavirus structural protein(s) were obtained by using different combined expression of these proteins in Sf9 cells. Cellular DNA of 5 kbp in size was packaged in all of the recombinant particles, which showed the same diameter as that of native virions. Agarose gel electrophoresis indicated that DNA packaged in these recombinant particles had a different pattern than that of native virions. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the VP1 species of recombinant particles showed more VP1 species than those of the native virions from mouse cells, and an additional species of VP1 when VP2 was co-expressed with VP1. The recombinant particles were also compared for their ability to compete for polyomavirus infection. The competition assay indicated that the recombinant particles containing VP2 were the most efficient in inhibiting the native polyomavirus infection of 3T6 cells.	0

7760126	Factors shaping the tone level sensitivity of single neurons in posterior field of cat auditory cortex. 1. The posterior field (field P) of the cat's auditory cortex contains a higher proportion of neurons whose response/level functions for characteristic frequency (CF) tones are nonmonotonic than does the primary field (AI). The general purpose of the present study is to assess whether the response/level functions of field P neurons are generated by the same mechanisms as those of cells in AI. All of the data came from single neurons in the cortices of barbiturate-anesthetized cats, to which we presented tonal stimuli through sealed, calibrated stimulating systems. 2. We obtained quantitative data from 123 neurons, of which 108 were located in field P. Of the 108 field P cells, 70% had nonmonotonic response/level functions for 5-ms rise time tones of CF. For cells of any given CF, both CF thresholds and best SPLs (i.e., SPLs associated with maximal responses) varied widely. A correlation analysis revealed that a linear relation between best SPL and CF threshold accounted for 73% of the data variance in the association between those response variables. An analysis of data from 83 nonmonotonic cells in AI revealed a similar relation. 3. Field P neurons whose response/level functions were non-monotonic for 5-ms rise time CF tones became even more narrowly tuned to SPL when the rise time of the tone bursts was reduced to 1 ms. Lengthening the rise time to 20 ms reduced or eliminated the SPL tuning in almost all of these neurons. The general form of monotonic tone response/level functions was commonly unaffected by variation in signal rise time. In a few instances, cells with monotonic response/level functions for 5- and 20-ms rise time tones developed nonmonotonic functions for 1-ms rise time tones. 4. Field P neurons with nonmonotonic response/level functions for CF tones usually failed to respond to wideband noise pulses, or, less commonly, responded to noise only at low SPLs. In contrast, field P cells with a monotonic response to CF tones usually responded monotonically to noise. 5. The minimal mean first-spike latencies of field P neurons were generally longer than those of AI cells studied under similar conditions. The precision of first-spike timing, measured using the SD of the mean first-spike latency, was commonly poorer than that of AI cells. 6. The properties of field P cells followed the same rules as those seen in AI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	0
15875338	Bosentan: new preparation. Pulmonary hypertension: an option before epoprostenol infusion. (1) Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disorder characterised by abnormally high pulmonary artery pressure, leading to right ventricular failure and death, generally after a few years. (2) Treatment usually combines an anticoagulant, oxygen therapy, a diuretic and, sometimes a calcium channel blocker. Efficacy is poorly documented but appears to be limited. Long-term treatment with epoprostenol (prostacyclin), given as a continuous intravenous infusion via a central catheter and pump improves the quality of life of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (NYHA classes III and IV, associated with discomfort during daily activities or even at rest). The impact of this treatment on survival seems to depend on the type of pulmonary hypertension: benefits were seen in a trial in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, while there was no effect in another trial in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with scleroderma. Epoprostenol causes numerous adverse effects, some of which can be severe. (3) Marketing authorisation was recently granted in Europe for oral bosentan therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension severe enough to restrict daily activities. (4) Two placebo-controlled trials lasting 12 to 16 weeks included 32 and 213 patients who responded inadequately to calcium channel blockers. They showed that the 6-minute walking distance improved by a median of 76 metres and 44 metres, respectively. In the trial with 213 patients, 42% of patients in the bosentan group and 30% of those in the placebo group were improved according to the NHYA scale. No impact on survival was observed in these short trials. (5) A trial in 33 patients showed no difference in symptom improvement between groups treated with intravenous epoprostenol + oral bosentan or intravenous epoprostenol + oral placebo. (6) Two adverse effects require monitoring, namely anemia and elevated transaminase activity. Bosentan carries a risk of multiple pharmacokinetic interactions and is teratogenic in animals. Women taking bosentan cannot use hormone-based contraception, because of a pharmacokinetic interaction. (7) In practice, oral bosentan improves symptoms in patients whose daily activities are restricted by pulmonary arterial hypertension. Bosentan is easy to use, making it an option before continuous intravenous epoprostenol infusion, even though it may not be as effective.	0

21536904	Interaction between the RNA binding domains of Ser-Arg splicing factor 1 and U1-70K snRNP protein determines early spliceosome assembly. It has been widely accepted that the early spliceosome assembly begins with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) binding to the 5' splice site (5'SS), which is assisted by the Ser/Arg (SR)-rich proteins in mammalian cells. In this process, the RS domain of SR proteins is thought to directly interact with the RS motif of U1-70K, which is subject to regulation by RS domain phosphorylation. Here we report that the early spliceosome assembly event is mediated by the RNA recognition domains (RRM) of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), which bridges the RRM of U1-70K to pre-mRNA by using the surface opposite to the RNA binding site. Specific mutation in the RRM of SRSF1 that disrupted the RRM-RRM interaction also inhibits the formation of spliceosomal E complex and splicing. We further demonstrate that the hypo-phosphorylated RS domain of SRSF1 interacts with its own RRM, thus competing with U1-70K binding, whereas the hyper-phosphorylated RS domain permits the formation of a ternary complex containing ESE, an SR protein, and U1 snRNP. Therefore, phosphorylation of the RS domain in SRSF1 appears to induce a key molecular switch from intra- to intermolecular interactions, suggesting a plausible mechanism for the documented requirement for the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle during pre-mRNA splicing.	0

17693519	Nanoscale visualization of a fibrillar array in the cell wall of filamentous cyanobacteria and its implications for gliding motility. Many filamentous cyanobacteria are motile by gliding, which requires attachment to a surface. There are two main theories to explain the mechanism of gliding. According to the first, the filament is pushed forward by small waves that pass along the cell surface. In the second, gliding is powered by the extrusion of slime through pores surrounding each cell septum. We have previously shown that the cell walls of several motile cyanobacteria possess an array of parallel fibrils between the peptidoglycan and the outer membrane and have speculated that the function of this array may be to generate surface waves to power gliding. Here, we report on a study of the cell surface topography of two morphologically different filamentous cyanobacteria, using field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). FEGSEM and AFM images of Oscillatoria sp. strain A2 confirmed the presence of an array of fibrils, visible as parallel corrugations on the cell surface. These corrugations were also visualized by AFM scanning of fully hydrated filaments under liquid; this has not been achieved before for filamentous bacteria. FEGSEM images of Nostoc punctiforme revealed a highly convoluted, not parallel, fibrillar array. We conclude that an array of parallel fibrils, beneath the outer membrane of Oscillatoria, may function in the generation of thrust in gliding motility. The array of convoluted fibrils in N. punctiforme may have an alternative function, perhaps connected with the increase in outer membrane surface area resulting from the presence of the fibrils.	0
18202970	Radioimmunotherapeutic approaches for leukemia: the past, present and future. For more than a decade, Ab conjugated to a radionuclide emitting particulate radiation has been used in the management of leukemia in an effort to deliver targeted doses of radiation to BM, spleen and other sites of disease, while sparing normal organs. This radioimmunotherapy (RIT) approach has been employed to achieve significant remissions in patients with AML, particularly when used at high doses of radioactivity in conjunction with myeloablation. This report focuses on the therapeutic aspects of radiolabeled Ab for leukemia. Clinical results from recent leukemia RIT studies are reviewed, with emphasis on approaches being evaluated to improve rates of response and survival. Discussion of pre-clinical studies are limited to those that offer insights into future directions for clinical RIT studies of leukemia.	0

8956028	Genetic study in Panaquire, a Venezuelan population. Panaquire is a population in Venezuela founded in 1733 by Spaniards from the Canary Islands. In order to define the genetic characteristics of this population the following loci were studied: ABO, RH (Cc, D, Ee), FY, K, JK, HB, ESD, ACP1, HP, TF, CP and ALB. Its sociohistorical features were also investigated. Historic censuses reveal that ethnically Blacks were the most important group in this village during the year 1800 (76%), followed by Amerindians (9%), Mulattoes (5%) and Whites (7%). The results of this analysis show that presently the most important genetic component is of African origin (59%), followed by Amerindian (26%) and Caucasian (15%) contributions. These results suggest that Canarians founded Panaquire, but unfavorable sociopolitical and environmental circumstances, as well as the entrance of former slaves, determined the village's evolution as a Black population. Important gene flow also occurred from Indian settlements, and some admixture with Whites. Our analysis shows once again the importance of handling together genetic and sociocultural variables to have a better interpretation of the evolution of human populations.	0

10820432	Nitric oxide synthase induction in astroglial cell cultures: effect on heat shock protein 70 synthesis and oxidant/antioxidant balance. Glial cells in the nervous system can produce nitric oxide in response to cytokines. This production is mediated by the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Radical oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) derivatives have been claimed to play a crucial role in many different processes, both physiological such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity, response to glutamate, and pathological such as ischemia and various neurodegenerative disorders. In the present study we investigated the effects of NO synthase (iNOS) induction in astrocyte cultures on the synthesis of heat shock proteins, the activity of respiratory chain complexes and the oxidant/antioxidant balance. Treatment of astrocyte cultures for 18 hr with LPS and INFgamma produced a dose dependent increase of iNOS associated with an increased synthesis of hsp70 stress proteins. This effect was abolished by the NO synthase inhibitor L-NMMA and significantly decreased by addition of SOD/CAT in the medium. Time course experiments showed that iNOS induced protein expression increased significantly by 2 hr after treatment with LPS and INFgamma and reached a plateau at 18 hr; hsp70 protein synthesis peaked around 18 and 36 hr after the same treatment. Addition to astrocytes of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside resulted in a dose dependent increase in hsp70 protein that was comparable to that found after a mild heat shock. Additionally, a decrease in cytochrome oxidase activity, a marked decrease in ATP and protein sulfhydryl contents, an increase in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes mt-SOD and catalase were found which were abolished by L-NMMA. These findings suggest the importance of mitochondrial energy impairment as a critical determinant of the susceptibility of astrocytes to neurotoxic processes and point to a possible pivotal role of hsp70 in the signalling pathways of stress tolerance.	0
20054210	Heterodimerization of hypothalamic G-protein-coupled receptors involved in weight regulation. BACKGROUND: Melanocortin 3 and 4 receptors (MC3R and MC4R) are known to play an essential role in hypothalamic weight regulation. In addition to these two G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a huge number of other GPCRs are expressed in hypothalamic regions, and some of them are involved in weight regulation. So far, homodimerization was shown for a few of these receptors. Heterodimerization of unrelated receptors may have profound functional consequence but heterodimerization of GPCRs involved in weight regulation was not reported yet. METHODS: A selective number of hypothalamically expressed GPCRs were cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector. Cell surface expression was demonstrated by an ELISA approach. Subcellular distribution was investigated by confocal laser microscopy. A sandwich ELISA and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) were used to determine protein-protein interaction. RESULTS: Via sandwich ELISA and FRET approach we could demonstrate a robust interaction of the MC4R with GPR7, both of which are expressed in the hypothalamic nucleus paraventricularis. Moreover, we determined a strong interaction of MC3R with the growth hormone secretagogue receptor expressed in the nucleus arcuatus. CONCLUSION: Identification GPCR heterodimerization adds to the understanding of the complexity of weight regulation and may provide important information to develop therapeutic strategies to treat obesity.	0

11821332	The influence of socioeconomic status on stillbirth risk in Sweden. BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status (SES) is generally associated with increased risk of stillbirth, but the mechanisms have rarely been investigated. Our aim was to study the association between SES and risk of stillbirth, and to assess whether any differences in risk are mediated by other maternal socio-demographic or anthropometrical characteristics, differences in lifestyle, or attendance at antenatal care. METHODS: Population-based individually-matched case-control study including 702 cases of stillbirth and 702 controls among Swedish primiparous women giving birth 1987-1996. We estimated the risk of stillbirth, and subgroups of stillbirth, for various categories of SES. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI, estimated by conditional logistic regression, were used to approximate the relative risk. The estimates were adjusted for maternal age, height, body mass index, cigarette smoking, and when necessary mother's country of birth. RESULTS: Compared with women who were high level white-collar workers, the adjusted risks of stillbirth were as follows: unskilled blue-collar workers, 2.2 (95% CI : 1.3- 3.7), skilled blue-collar workers, 2.4 (95% CI : 1.3-4.1), low level white-collar workers, 1.9 (95% CI : 1.2-3.2), and intermediate level white-collar workers 1.4 (95% CI : 0.9-2.4). These risks were not substantially changed when we further adjusted for attendance at antenatal care, previous reproductive history, or excluded pregnancies with maternal diseases, and pregnancy-related disorders. Low social class was most associated with risks of term antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES increases the risk of stillbirth. The association could not be explained by any of the factors we studied, and the underlying reasons remain unclear.	0
23590909	Modulation of native GABA(A) receptor activity by triazolo 1,5-benzodiazepines. In previous work our group described the synthesis and the activity on rat cerebellum granule cell GABAA receptors of new 1,5-benzodiazepine compounds. Here we are describing the synthesis of new triazolobenzodiazepines (mainly 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives) and the evaluation of their biological activity in terms of effects on those GABAA receptors. Their effects were compared to those of 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists and some known 1,5-benzodiazepines. The activities were evaluated for the two GABAA receptor populations present in cerebellar granule cells, one mediating phasic inhibition and the other one mediating tonic inhibition. Some of the compounds displayed a profile of agonist at the component mediating phasic inhibition. This agonistic activity was prevented by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. Interestingly, the active compounds displayed an agonistic activity at these receptors significantly greater than that of \"classical\" 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists, such as diazepam, flunitrazepam and alprazolam.	0

18757426	Tissue prostate-specific antigen facilitates refractory prostate tumor progression via enhancing ARA70-regulated androgen receptor transactivation. Despite being well recognized as the best biomarker for prostate cancer, pathophysiologic roles of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) remain unclear. We report here that tissue PSA may be involved in the hormone-refractory prostate cancer progression. Histologic analyses show that the increased tissue PSA levels are correlated with lower cell apoptosis index and higher cell proliferation rate in hormone-refractory tumor specimens. By stably transfecting PSA cDNA into various prostate cancer cell lines, we found that PSA could promote the growth of androgen receptor (AR)-positive CWR22rv1 and high-passage LNCaP (hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells) but not that of AR-negative PC-3 and DU145 cells. Surprisingly, the protease activity of PSA is not crucial for PSA to stimulate growth and promote AR transactivation. We further showed that increased PSA could enhance ARA70-induced AR transactivation via modulating the p53 pathway that results in the decreased apoptosis and increased cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of PSA in LNCaP and CWR22rv1 cells causes cell apoptosis and cell growth arrest at the G(1) phase. In vitro colony formation assay and in vivo xenografted tumor results showed the suppression of prostate cancer growth via targeting PSA expression. Collectively, our findings suggest that, in addition to being a biomarker, PSA may also become a new potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer. PSA small interfering RNA or smaller molecules that can degrade PSA protein may be developed as alternative approaches to treat the prostate cancer.	0
23250675	[Prediction of cognitive impairment in the elderly by analysing their performance in verbal fluency and in sustained attention]. INTRODUCTION: Cognitive decline is related to different kind of biopsychosocial variables in the elderly. AIM. To identify which cognitive variables are important to differentiate between healthy elderly people and elderly people with cognitive impairment in order to propose a brief screening assessment for cognitive impairment in which education is not relevant. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 264 subjects were divided into two groups taking into account the cutoff point 23/24 in the MEC, and all of them were assessed in cognitive functioning, sustained attention, cognitive plasticity, working memory, and verbal fluency. RESULTS: Discriminant analysis showed that the cognitive variables which best explain cognitive impairment were verbal fluency, sustained attention and cognitive plasticity. The area under the ROC curve for the verbal fluency task was 0.811 and for the sustained attention task was 0.777. A cutoff point with 10 words in the verbal fluency task showed a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 80% for healthy elderly people, while a cutoff point with 33 correct answers in the sustained attention task showed a sensitivity of 68.4% and a specificity of 68.6% for the same group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a high performance on verbal fluency and sustained attention protect against cognitive impairment in the elderly so that verbal fluency and sustained attention tasks are good tests for cognitive impairment screening purposes.	0

16041384	NFAT and Osterix cooperatively regulate bone formation. Immunosuppressants are crucial in the prevention of detrimental immune reactions associated with allogenic organ transplantation, but they often cause adverse effects in a number of biological systems, including the skeletal system. Calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibit nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity and induce strong immunosuppression. Among NFAT proteins, NFATc1 is crucial for the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Here we show FK506 administration induces the reduction of bone mass despite a blockade of osteoclast differentiation. This reduction is caused by severe impairment of bone formation, suggesting that NFAT transcription factors also have an important role in the transcriptional program of osteoblasts. In fact, bone formation is inhibited in Nfatc1- and Nfatc2-deficient cells as well as in FK506-treated osteoblasts. Overexpression of NFATc1 stimulates Osterix-dependent activation of the Col1a1 (encoding type I collagen) promoter, but not Runx2-dependent activation of the Bglap1 (encoding osteocalcin) promoter. NFAT and Osterix form a complex that binds to DNA, and this interaction is important for the transcriptional activity of Osterix. Thus, NFAT and Osterix cooperatively control osteoblastic bone formation. These results may provide important insight into the management of post-transplantation osteoporosis as well as a new strategy for promoting bone regeneration in osteopenic disease.	1

Several studies have shown marked differences in the neural localization of language functions in the brains of left-handed individuals when compared with right-handers. Previous experiments involving functional lateralization have demonstrated cerebral blood flow patterns that differ concordantly with subject handedness while performing language-related tasks. The effect of handedness on function in specific stages of memory processing, however, is a largely unexplored area. We used a paired-associates verbal memory task to elicit activation of neural areas related to declarative memory, examining the hypothesis that there are differences in activation in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) between handedness groups. 15 left-handed and 25 right-handed healthy adults were matched for all major demographic and neuropsychological variables. Functional and structural imaging data were acquired and analyzed for group differences within MTL subregions. Our results show that activation of the MTL during declarative memory processing varies with handedness. While both groups showed activation in left and right MTL subregions, the left-handed group showed a statistically significant increase in the left hippocampus and amygdala during both encoding and recall. No increases in activation were found in the right-handed group. This effect was found in the absence of any differences in performance on the verbal memory task, structural volumetric disparities, or functional asymmetries. This provides evidence of functional differences between left-handers and right-handers, which extends to declarative memory processes.	0

17095860	Congenital combined defects of factor VII: a critical review. Factor VII deficiency is the least rare among uncommon congenital coagulation disorders. The majority of cases are isolated deficiencies. In some cases, FVII deficiency has been found to be associated with the deficiency in another coagulation factor or with non-coagulation-related abnormalities or defects. The evaluation of all published studies on the subject has shown that the FVII defect has been reported in association with FV, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI and protein C defects. Furthermore, FVII deficiency has been described in association with bilirubin metabolism disorders, mental retardation, microcephaly, epicanthus, cleft palate and persistence of ductus arteriosus. The most interesting association appears to be that with FX. This has been shown to be due to a deletion in part of the long arm of chromosome 13. This arm contains genes coding for both FVII and FX. Interestingly, this combined coagulation defect has been found to be associated with carotid body tumors and several other malformations. Combined defects in blood coagulation often create diagnostic difficulties since results cannot be explained if a single factor deficiency is assumed. For example the combined FVII and FX defect yields a rather peculiar laboratory picture (prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time, but normal thrombin time) that could suggest FII or FV or FX single deficiency and not FVII deficiency, indicating the need for specific factor assays whenever data are confusing. Finally, the elevated incidence of mental and skeletal malformations present in these combined defects indicates the need for a careful evaluation of all these patients lest some aspects of the defect are missed.	0

16490999	Membrane-activated form of glycoproteins IIb/IIIa complex on newborn platelets. BACKGROUND: GPIIb/IIIa complex is one of the laboratory markers of platelet activation. Closely associated with this process is exposure of the fibrinogen-binding site which is essential for platelets aggregation. This study was performed to evaluate the expression of GPIIb/IIIa on the platelets at time of birth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 51 term newborns, 21 females and 30 males, were introduced to the study. They fitted all criteria for healthy term newborns. Blood was collected from umbilical artery and vein immediately after cutting the umbilical cord using Diatube TM CTAD Vacutainer System. GPIIb/IIIa was tested with PAC-1-FITC antibody using flow cytometer EPICS XL. RESULTS: 90.91% of newborn platelets express GPIIb/IIIa complex in comparison to adults, where only 12.79% platelets express this complex. Practically no differences were noted in relation to gender of newborns and umbilical artery or vein. CONCLUSIONS: Careful analysis of the presented data reveals that at time of birth platelets are hyperreactive, which may be related to the increased thrombogenesis in newborns and mothers.	0
15569307	Angiotensin II stimulates Pax-2 in rat kidney proximal tubular cells: impact on proliferation and apoptosis. BACKGROUND: The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is intimately involved in the tubular cell proliferation, apoptosis and regeneration that occur following renal injury. Though tubular angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 receptors (AT2R) decrease greatly after birth, their number increases after injury. Notably, during recovery from injury, renal tubular cells display a relatively immature phenotype expressing genes that are involved in nephron development, for example, the paired homeobox-2 gene (Pax-2). The present investigation hypothesized that AT2R activation would stimulate Pax-2 gene expression in immortalized rat renal proximal tubular cells (IRPTC), as we have found in fetal cells. METHODS: Pax-2 gene expression in IRPTC was evaluated by immunofluorescence, Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with or without Ang II treatment; apoptosis and proliferation were analyzed by terminal transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in stable IRPTC transformants with Pax-2 sense and antisense orientation, respectively. RESULTS: Ang II up-regulated Pax-2 gene expression via AT2R in IRPTC. The stimulatory effect of both Ang II on Pax-2 gene expression was blocked by PD123319 (AT2R inhibitor), AG 490 (specific Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor) and genistein (tyrosine kinase inhibitor), but not by losartan (AT1R inhibitor). Stable transfection of sense Pax-2 cDNA increased, whereas antisense Pax-2 cDNA down-regulated Pax-2 expression. CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that Ang II stimulates Pax-2 gene expression in IRPTC via AT2R and the JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling transduction pathway, which may be important in renal repair following injury. Cells lacking Pax-2 gene expression appear to be prone toward apoptosis rather than proliferation.	0
18969847	High-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of cyclosporine A and its four major metabolites in whole blood. This study aimed to develop a simple and efficient optimized high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) method for simultaneous determination of cyclosporine A (CyA) and its major, partly active metabolites AM1, AM9, AM4N, and AM19 in whole blood from transplant patients using cyclosporine D (CyD) as internal standard. The method used a CN analytical column maintained at 60 degrees C with hexan-isopropanol (93:7, v/v) as mobile phase; detection was at 212nm. Linearity for all five compounds was tested in the range of 31-1500ngml(-1) for CyA and of 31-1000ngml(-1) for metabolites. The limit of detection was found to be 15ngml(-1) for all compounds. This modified, inexpensive method is also suitable for measuring cyclosporine A and metabolite concentrations in routine monitoring of patients undergoing treatment with CyA.	0

11450495	Effect of ultraviolet radiation on melanogenesis in four different types of cultured bovine ocular pigmented cells. BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation is thought to play a causative role in various ocular diseases such as macular degeneration, cataract, and possibly melanomas. Since most of the energy is absorbed by pigmented cells, the aim of this study was to examine and compare the reactions of different ocular melanocytic cells to ultraviolet light in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bovine iris melanocytes, choroidal melanocytes, iris pigment epithelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells were isolated and cultured. Semiconfluent cultures were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (280-380 nm). Cell number and melanin content were measured 10 days after radiation. Selected samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Following irradiation with ultraviolet light for 30 s, 60 s, and 120 s, the number of cells in culture decreased markedly. In contrast, total melanin content in the cultures of iris melanocytes, choroidal melanocytes, and iris pigment epithelial cells did not decrease despite the reduced number of cells. This finding suggested an increase in melanin per cell. However, the increase in average melanin content observed was not due to melanogenesis, because treatment with the melanogenesis inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine did not reduce the melanin content of the cultures and electron-microscopic examination showed no morphological evidence of increased melanogenesis. CONCLUSION: In vitro, there was no convincing evidence of ultraviolet radiation-induced melanogenesis in ocular pigmented cells. Thus, it seems that ultraviolet radiation is a selection factor: more densely pigmented cells survive the treatment better than less pigmented cells.	0
14669217	[One base deletion of the alpha(1,4) galactosyltransferase gene responsible for p phenotype]. OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular genetic basis for p phenotype. METHODS: Red blood cell phenotype of the proband was characterized by standard serological technique. Exon 3 of the alpha (1,4) galactosyltransferase gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of the proband. The amplified PCR products were excised and purified from agarose gels and direct sequenced. RESULTS: Homozygous single nucleotide G deletion at position 300 or 301 was found in the proband, which caused a reading frame shift at codon 101,resulting in a premature stop at codon 113. Parents of the proband were heterozygous carriers. CONCLUSION: A novel single guanosine deletion at position 300 or 301 of alpha (1,4) galactosyltransferase gene was determined, which may be one facet of the molecular basis for p phenotype.	0
16496400	Increased recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli strains with overexpressed water-forming NADH oxidase and a deleted ArcA regulatory protein. Glycolytic flux is increased and acetate production is reduced in Escherichia coli by the expression of heterologous NADH oxidase (NOX) from Streptococcus pneumoniae coupled with the deletion of the arcA gene, which encodes the ArcA regulatory protein. In this study, we examined the overproduction of a model recombinant protein in strains of E. coli expressing NOX with or without an arcA mutation. The presence of NOX or the absence of ArcA reduced acetate by about 50% and increased beta-galactosidase production by 10-20%. The presence of NOX in the arcA strain eliminated acetate production entirely in batch fermentations and resulted in a 120% increase in beta-galactosidase production.	0

24273177	The complement C3a receptor is critical in defense against Chlamydia psittaci in mouse lung infection and required for antibody and optimal T cell response. BACKGROUND: The complement system protects against extracellular pathogens and links innate and adaptive immunity. In this study, we investigated the anaphylatoxin C3a receptor (C3aR) in Chlamydia psittaci lung infection and elucidated C3a-dependent adaptive immune mechanisms. METHODS: Survival, body weight, and clinical score were monitored in primary mouse infection and after serum transfer. Bacterial load, histology, cellular distribution, cytokines, antibodies, and lymphocytes were analyzed. RESULTS: C3aR(-/-) mice showed prolonged pneumonia with decreased survival, lower weight, and higher clinical score. Compared to wild-type mice bacterial clearance was impaired, and inflammatory parameters were increased. In lung-draining lymph nodes of C3aR(-/-) mice the total number of B cells, CD4(+) T cells, and Chlamydia-specific IFN-y(+) (CD4(+) or CD8(+)) cells was reduced upon infection, and the mice were incapable of Chlamydia-specific immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin G production. Performed before infection, transfer of hyperimmune serum prolonged survival of C3aR(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: C3a and its receptor are critical for defense against C. psittaci in mouse lung infection. In this model, C3a acts via its receptor as immune modulator. Enhancement of specific B and T cell responses upon infection with an intracellular bacterium were identified as hitherto unknown features of C3a/C3aR. These new functions might be of general immunological importance.	0
15653915	Phylogenetic relationships of the genus Kluyvera: transfer of Enterobacter intermedius Izard et al. 1980 to the genus Kluyvera as Kluyvera intermedia comb. nov. and reclassification of Kluyvera cochleae as a later synonym of K. intermedia. In order to assess the relationship between the genus Kluyvera and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, the 16S rRNA genes of type strains of the recognized Kluyvera species, Kluyvera georgiana, Kluyvera cochleae, Kluyvera ascorbata and Kluyvera cryocrescens, were sequenced. A comparative phylogenetic analysis based on these 16S rRNA gene sequences and those available for strains belonging to several genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae showed that members of the genus Kluyvera form a cluster that contains all the known Kluyvera species. However, the type strain of Enterobacter intermedius (ATCC 33110T) was included within this cluster in a very close relationship with the type strain of K. cochleae (ATCC 51609T). In addition to the phylogenetic evidence, biochemical and DNA-DNA hybridization analyses of species within this cluster indicated that the type strain of E. intermedius is in fact a member of the genus Kluyvera and, within it, of the species Kluyvera cochleae. Therefore, following the current rules for bacterial nomenclature and classification, the transfer of E. intermedius to the genus Kluyvera as Kluyvera intermedia comb. nov. is proposed (type strain, ATCC 33110T=CIP 79.27T=LMG 2785T=CCUG 14183T). Biochemical analysis of four E. intermedius strains and one K. cochleae strain independent of the respective type strains further indicated that E. intermedius and K. cochleae represent the same species and are therefore heterotypic synonyms. Nomenclatural priority goes to the oldest legitimate epithet. Consequently, Kluyvera cochleae Muller et al. 1996 is a later synonym of Kluyvera intermedia (Izard et al. 1980) Pavan et al. 2005.	0
21934743	Enhanced reversed Cherenkov radiation in a waveguide with double-negative metamaterials. In order to enhance the radiation energy of reversed Cherenkov radiation (RCR), on the basis of the single charged particle model, we developed a theoretical method using a charged particle beam bunch to enhance RCR in a circular waveguide partially filled with anisotropic double-negative metamaterials (DNMs). In this case, the reversed radiation mechanism is further illustrated. Numerical example shows that the radiated energy can be effectively enhanced by increasing the charged particle number in a short bunch and thus be readily detectable. The method reported here offers a theoretical basis for directly observing RCR using a charged particle beam bunch.	0
12170567	The use of methadone for cancer pain. Methadone is not a new analgesic drug [69]. Several studies have demonstrated that methadone is a valid alternative to morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl for the treatment of cancer-related pain, and extensive reviews on the subject have been published in recent years [10,23,25,64,70,71]. Most people involved in pain therapy, however, are not well informed about the properties of methadone. The authors believe that the low cost of methadone paradoxically contributes to the limited knowledge of its characteristics and to the restricted therapeutic use of this drug. The low cost of methadone means there is little financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research or to disseminate scientific information. Unfortunately, the lack of scientific information from pharmaceutical companies frequently results in a lack of knowledge on the part of physicians. Unless the existing approach changes, both culturally and politically, ignorance about methadone will persist among medical experts. The low cost of methadone, rather than being an advantage, will result in the limited exploitation of an effective drug.	0

14667417	Self-generated alcohol outcomes in 8th and 10th graders: exposure to vicarious sources of alcohol information. The perceived positive and negative outcomes of alcohol use were studied in a sample of normal 8th and 10th grade students. Participants' responses provided associative frequency norms valuable for future research. Regression analyses showed (1) none of the individual-difference variables (alcohol use, exposure to vicarious sources of alcohol information, such as televised advertising, and demographics) predicted self-generated responses, and (2) alcohol use and first-hand observation of others' drinking did predict the valence respondents assigned to the outcomes. Results support and extend the findings of Stacy, Galaif, Sussman, and Dent [Psychology of Addictive Behaviors 10(1) 1996 18], wherein self-generated drug use outcomes appeared to be available in memory regardless of previous drug use or other individual differences.	0
16333358	Mechanical plasticity and contractile properties of airway smooth muscle. Smooth muscle has the unique ability to adapt easily and quickly to length changes without compromising its ability to generate force. This ability is referred to as mechanical plasticity and is now considered to be an important aspect of smooth muscle that affects both its contractile and relaxation behaviour. It is therefore important to incorporate knowledge of plasticity into further studies of smooth muscle behaviour. It is also important that future studies be focused on deciphering the mechanism of smooth muscle length adaptation and plasticity. This review outlines some of the proposed mechanisms determining plasticity. However, it should be said that there are other proposed mechanisms not touched upon here, which may be equally as important. This review also focuses on the relevance of smooth muscle plasticity in asthma, but it is important to remember that there are other places where smooth muscle plasticity may play an equally important role.	0
20644014	Genetic variation at the phospholipid transfer protein locus affects its activity and high-density lipoprotein size and is a novel marker of cardiovascular disease susceptibility. BACKGROUND: In contrast to clear associations between variants in genes participating in low-density lipoprotein metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk, such associations for high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-related genes are not well supported by recent large studies. We aimed to determine whether genetic variants at the locus encoding phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), a protein involved in HDL remodeling, underlie altered PLTP activity, HDL particle concentration and size, and cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed associations between 6 PLTP tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms and PLTP activity in 2 studies (combined n=384) and identified 2 variants that show reproducible associations with altered plasma PLTP activity. A gene score based on these variants is associated with lower hepatic PLTP transcription (P=3.2x10(-18)) in a third study (n=957) and with an increased number of HDL particles of smaller size (P=3.4x10(-17)) in a fourth study (n=3375). In a combination of 5 cardiovascular disease case-control studies (n=4658 cases and 11 459 controls), a higher gene score was associated with a lower cardiovascular disease risk (per-allele odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.98; P=1.2x10(-3); odds ratio for highest versus lowest gene score, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.86; P=1.0x10(-3)). CONCLUSIONS: A gene score based on 2 PLTP single nucleotide polymorphisms is associated with lower PLTP transcription and activity, an increased number of HDL particles, smaller HDL size, and decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. These findings indicate that PLTP is a proatherogenic entity and suggest that modulation of specific elements of HDL metabolism may offer cardiovascular benefit.	0
22019352	Pulmonary hemorrhage induced by epileptic seizure. We report a 35-year-old man who presented with pulmonary hemorrhage induced by an epileptic seizure. He had experienced recurrent episodes of massive hemoptysis after epileptic seizures since the age of 28 years. He was admitted to Kyoto University Hospital with massive hemoptysis and hypoxia after an epileptic seizure of a few minutes' duration. Radiographic signs of infiltrations and hemorrhagic bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were observed. He was intubated and successfully treated with anti-epilepsy drugs and corticosteroids. Epileptic seizures may have induced increased pulmonary vascular permeability and structural damage to the blood-gas barrier, which may have caused pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary hemorrhage could be in the list of differential diagnoses of hemoptysis in patients with epilepsy.	0

15592709	[Interdisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of complex patients with advanced testicular germ cell tumor]. Testicular germ cell tumors represent the classic example of a curable solid cancer even in the metastatic stage. Cure rates are as high as 95% and 80-85% in patients with good and intermediate prognosis; even in patients with poor prognosis cure rates of 50% have been achieved by interdisciplinary collaboration of all specialties involved in the management of testis cancer. Standardization of diagnosis and therapy should be further optimized due to the recently published interdisciplinary national and European guidelines. Besides realization of standardized guidelines, treatment of patients with extensive primary disease or recurrent germ cell tumors following standard therapy requires comprehensive knowledge in conservative and surgical management, which is basically only available at specialized cancer centers. Patients with complex findings, especially if associated with a poor prognosis according to IGCCCG, should be referred to specialized tertiary referral centers at a very early stage, since the cure rates depend not only on the consideration of guidelines but also on the expertise of the attending oncologist and surgeon. When treating these patients, one has to consider that inadequately administered chemotherapy (dosage, length of cycles, number of cycles) cannot be compensated for by surgery and that inadequately performed retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy or residual tumor resection cannot be compensated for by chemotherapy. In any case, suboptimal primary therapy will result in inferior cure rates and an unnecessarily increased mortality rate.	0

8886980	N-tropomodulin: a novel isoform of tropomodulin identified as the major binding protein to brain tropomyosin. We have identified and characterized two proteins in rat brain that bind to the neuron-specific tropomyosin isoform, TMBr3. The two proteins were identified by blot overlay assay, in which the proteins immobilized on the membrane were probed by epitope-tagged TMBr3, followed by detection with anti-epitope antibody. We have purified these proteins using a TMBr3 affinity column. Peptide sequencing as well as immunoblotting showed that one of the two proteins is identical to tropomodulin, a tropomyosin-binding protein originally identified in erythrocytes. The cDNA for the other protein was cloned from an adult rat brain cDNA library using degenerate oligonucleotides that we designed based on the peptide sequences. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clone revealed this protein to be a novel isoform of tropomodulin which is the product of a distinct gene, and is herein referred to as N-tropomodulin. Recombinant N-tropomodulin bound to TMBr3 as well as to other low molecular mass tropomyosins (TM5a or TM5), but not to high molecular mass tropomyosins (TM2 or TMBr1). Northern blotting and RNase protection assays as well as immunoblotting showed that N-tropomodulin is expressed predominantly in brain. Furthermore, RNase protection assays revealed no alternatively spliced regions within the coding sequence. Developmentally, N-tropomodulin was detected in rat brain as early as embryonic day 14 and reaches the adult level before birth. Immunofluorescence of primary frontal cortex cell cultures showed that N-tropomodulin is specifically expressed in neurons. The neuron-specific expression of N-tropomodulin strongly suggests specialized roles of this TM-binding protein in neurons.	0
10613411	Plasma free, phospholipid-bound and urinary free choline all decrease during a marathon run and may be associated with impaired performance. BACKGROUND: Previous investigations have shown that plasma free choline decreases during long distance running. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine if body choline status changes during a marathon run and whether performance is thereby adversely affected. DESIGN: Twenty-three accomplished marathon runners 25 to 49 years of age were studied before and after the 1997 Houston-Methodist Marathon. Fasting blood and five-hour urine samples were obtained in the morning, 14 days prior to the race, immediately after the race and approximately 48 hours after completion of the race. Runners were asked to predict their finish times two weeks prior to the race. Performance was indicated by the ratio of predicted to actual time. RESULTS: Both plasma free and phospholipid-bound choline concentrations as well as urinary free choline concentration decreased immediately following the race (19.2+/-4.5 to 14.6+/-4.2 nmol/mL, p=0.005, and 2565.2+/-516.4 to 2403.4+/-643.0 nmol/mL, p=0.068, respectively) and, except for the phospholipid-bound choline, rebounded towards baseline after 48 hours (15.6+/-3.2 and 2299.9+/-426.7 nmol/mL), although plasma concentrations remained significantly below baseline. Plasma free and phospholipid-bound choline concentrations were significantly correlated (r=0.46, p=0.0001), although urinary free choline concentration was not correlated with either. There was no correlation between plasma free, phospholipid-bound or urinary free choline concentration and actual finish time or the ratio of predicted to actual finish time. However, the percent decrease in urinary free choline concentration was significantly correlated with the ratio of predicted to actual time (r=0.47, p=0.036). No relationship was seen between this ratio and the percent decrease in either plasma free or phospholipid-bound choline concentrations immediately after the race. CONCLUSION: Our finding of both decreased free and phospholipid-bound choline suggests the decrease in choline status is related to accelerated choline metabolism or enhanced choline uptake by tissues rather than decreased hepatic choline release. The role of choline supplementation during endurance running requires further investigation.	0

11121062	The effect of nitric oxide on cell respiration: A key to understanding its role in cell survival or death. The mitochondrion is a key organelle in the control of cell death. Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits complex IV in the respiratory chain and is reported to possess both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic actions. We investigated the effects of continuous inhibition of respiration by NO on mitochondrial energy status and cell viability. Serum-deprived human T cell leukemia (Jurkat) cells were exposed to NO at a concentration that caused continuous and complete (approximately 85%) inhibition of respiration. Serum deprivation caused progressive loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) and apoptotic cell death. In the presence of NO, Deltapsi(m) was maintained compared to controls, and cells were protected from apoptosis. Similar results were obtained by using staurosporin as the apoptotic stimulus. As exposure of serum-deprived cells to NO progressed (>5 h), however, Deltapsi(m) fell, correlating with the appearance of early apoptotic features and a decrease in cell viability. Glucose deprivation or iodoacetate treatment of cells in the presence of NO resulted in a collapse of Deltapsi(m), demonstrating involvement of glycolytic ATP in its maintenance. Under these conditions cell viability also was decreased. Treatment with oligomycin and/or bongkrekic acid indicated that the maintenance of Deltapsi(m) during exposure to NO is caused by reversal of the ATP synthase and other electrogenic pumps. Thus, blockade of complex IV by NO initiates a protective action in the mitochondrion to maintain Deltapsi(m) this results in prevention of apoptosis. It is likely that during cellular stress involving increased generation of NO this compound will trigger a similar sequence of events, depending on its concentration and duration of release.	0
17275878	Stigmastane and hopanes as conserved biomarkers for estimating oil biodegradation in a former refinery plant-contaminated soil. In the last decade, a refinery plant located in Lido Adriano, East Ravenna (Italy) has been subject to mineral oil contamination. The mineral crude oil, extracted from the offshore in Adriatic sea, consisted of 78% aliphatics, cyclic alkanes and saturated polycyclic hydrocarbons, 9% aromatics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and alkylated derivatives, and 13% of tars/asphaltenes. Analysis of soil after 10 years of natural attenuation revealed a complete depletion of linear (n-C(9)-C(24)), light aromatics (C1-C3/benzenes) and PAHs (C2/naphthalene, C1/phenanthrene); besides a substantial degradation of isoprenoids prystane and phytane, branched and cyclic alkanes. The remaining contaminants which withstood to natural degradation was saturated polycyclic hydrocarbons (perhydro-PAH derivatives), unsaturated polycyclic hydrocarbons (tetrahydro, dihydro-PAH derivatives), terpanes, steranes and unidentified compounds. Such residues resulted in 80% reduction of its concentration after two months of laboratory treatment. Samples were extracted by organic solvents, separated by silica/alumina gel column chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass selective detector (GC-MSD). Identification and quantification of aliphatic, cyclic alkanes, typical PAHs, terpanes and steranes were carried out to chromatograms of M/Z=85, 83, individual M/Zs, M/Z=191 and 217, respectively. The present work shows that, among numerous biomarkers present in the source oil, stigmastane and two isomers of hopane showed invariable concentrations after laboratory experiments that mimic natural biodegradation in the field, so they can be used as conserved internal biomarkers. These are very useful tools to assess alterations in less stable classes of saturated compounds contained in petroleum. Marked degradation of perhydro, tetrahydro, dihydro-PAH derivatives in the laboratory treatment has been evidenced.	0

10445480	Localization of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries in human temporomandibular joint discs. The localization of lymph capillaries and blood capillaries in the human temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs was examined immunohistologically with anti-human collagen IV antibody and anti-human von Willebrand factor in 26 human TMJ samples. The 16 internal derangement cases were then compared with the 10 normal control cases. The findings suggested that blood capillaries scarcely existed in all the fields of normal control TMJ discs (5/270, 1.9%) nor did lymph capillaries exist in the normal TMJ discs (0/270, 0%). New growth of blood capillaries had localized in all fields of the internal derangement discs specimens (113/378, 29.9%) and was concentrated in the lower area of the posterior part of the discs. The authors also observed a small distribution of lymph capillaries in all fields of this material (17/378, 4.5%). The new growth of lymph capillaries were always related to the blood capillary distribution and therefore their presence might be directly related to the capillary proliferation.	0

Adult HIV-1 patients (n = 78) with nadir CD4+ T cell counts <100 T cells/microl, at least 12 months on ART and 6 months of complete viral suppression (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml) were selected from a patient database. The cohort was divided according to current CD4+ T cell counts and patients from the lowest (n = 15) and highest (n = 12) tertiles were studied. Thymic volume was assessed by spiral computed tomography. Naive (CD45RA+CD62L+) and replicating (Ki67+) T cells were quantitated by flow cytometry, T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) were assessed by real-time PCR, and serum IL-7 and testosterone by immunoassay. Patients with low CD4+ T cell counts had smaller thymuses [0(0-5.3) vs. 3.5(0-15.6) cm(3), p = 0.04] and were more likely to have no detectable thymus. They had similar proportions of replicating cells, but fewer naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and less TREC in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells/ml of blood than patients with high CD4+ T cell counts. However, some patients with no detectable thymus had high numbers of naive and TREC-bearing T cells. Thus, the recovery of CD4+ T cells in severely immunodeficient HIV patients with a virological response to ART is probably limited by thymic function. However, the data are consistent with extrathymic T cell production contributing to the naive T cell pool in some patients.	0
23240952	Physiology, pathology and pharmacology of the male reproductive system. The male reproductive system consists of the testes, a ductal system and sex accessory organs. Production of sperm by the testes combined with fluids formed by the sex accessory organs (e.g. seminal vesicles, prostate and bulbourethral glands) produce a secretion that supports the survival of spermatozoa and provides a medium through which they can move through the reproductive ducts (e.g. epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct and urethra) for ejaculation of viable sperm into the female reproductive tract. Summarized herein are the essentials of normal male reproductive physiology, disorders of male sexual differentiation, pharmacological therapy of common diseases of the male genitourinary tract and the impact of drugs of abuse on the male reproductive system.	0
23422922	Impact of body-composition methodology on the composition of weight loss and weight gain. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We intended to (i) to compare the composition of weight loss and weight gain using densitometry, deuterium dilution (D   O), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the four-compartment (4C) model and (ii) to compare regional changes in fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle as assessed by DXA and MRI. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Eighty-three study participants aged between 21 and 58 years with a body mass index range of 20.2-46.8 kg/m(2) had been assessed at two different occasions with a mean follow-up between 23.5 and 43.5 months. Body-weight changes within < 3% were considered as weight stable, a gain or a loss of >3% of initial weight was considered as a significant weight change. RESULTS: There was a considerable bias between the body-composition data obtained by the individual methods. When compared with the 4C model, mean bias of D   O and densitometry was explained by the erroneous assumption of a constant hydration of FFM, thus, changes in FM were underestimated by D   O but overestimated by densitometry. Because hydration does not normalize after weight loss, all two-component models have a systematic error in weight-reduced subjects. The bias between 4C model and DXA was mainly explained by FM% at baseline, whereas FFM hydration contributed to additional 5%. As to the regional changes in body composition, DXA data had a considerable bias and, thus, cannot replace MRI. CONCLUSIONS: To assess changes in body composition associated with weight changes, only the 4C model and MRI can be used with confidence.	0

12662016	Organising pneumonia caused by transtuzumab (Herceptin) therapy for breast cancer. The case of a 49-yr-old female, who developed fever, effort dyspnoea and cough, with patchy migratory bilateral pulmonary infiltrates 6 weeks after starting transtuzumab therapy, following breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and hormone therapy for breast carcinoma, is reported here. Chest radiograph and thin section computed tomography demonstrated alveolar opacities with air bronchogram in both lungs. A lung biopsy was performed in a nonirradiated area of the contralateral lung and revealed a typical histological pattern of organising pneumonia (previously known as bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia). Transtuzumab therapy was discontinued and subsequent gradual clinical and radiological improvement was observed. After 3 months, complete resolution of symptoms and radiographical abnormalities were noted. This is the first case report that suggests that transtuzumab therapy might induce the development of lung infiltrates with the histological appearance of organising pneumonia.	0
23000450	-116A and K BCHE gene variants associated with obesity and hypertriglyceridemia in adolescents from Southern Brazil. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has been associated to body mass index (BMI), weight, cholesterol and triglyceride levels. -116A (rs1126680) and K (A539T, 1615A, rs1803274) BCHE gene variants had previously been associated to BChE activity, weight and BMI variance in adults. The present study examined -116A and K variants, BChE activity, anthropometric and biochemical variables associated with obesity in adolescents (120 obese and 150 non-obese from Curitiba, Brazil). Both -116A and K variants were found with significantly lower frequencies (p<0.05) in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population. Mean BChE activity (KU/L) was significantly higher in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population. Analyzing only the obese adolescents, it was found that carriers of the -116A variant showed lower BChE activity and higher triglyceride levels than homozygotes for the usual allele. Indeed, obese carriers of the -116A variant had triglyceride levels considered high according to reference values for serum triglycerides in Brazilian adolescents. These results show: (1) a protective effect of -116A and K variants on juvenile obesity risk, suggesting a role for the BCHE gene on juvenile onset obesity different from that observed on adult onset obesity and (2) an association of the -116A variant with hypertriglyceridemia in obese adolescents probably because of its effect on lowering BChE activity and consequently diminishing the enzyme capability of maintaining homeostasis on lipid metabolism during the metabolic stress caused by obesity.	0
18186769	How minerals may influence the development and expression of immunity to endoparasites in livestock. This review attempts to explain how dietary mineral intake may affect the immune system, with particular reference to gastrointestinal nematode infestations of livestock, and considers its significance for other gut infections as well as for other species. Of the 56 minerals found in mammalian tissues, 16 are currently considered to be essential, and a further 13 probably essential, for cell and tissue function. To date, eight of these have been shown to affect the function of the mammalian immune system directly. Nine others have roles in physiological pathways such as neurological or endocrine function, or protein or carbohydrate metabolism, which in turn regulate the immune system. The remainder may in the future be shown to have immunologically specific roles. The pathogenesis of mineral effects on immunity involves a number of pathways and molecular mechanisms. Major areas requiring further investigation are the relationship between deficiency of minerals and in vivo immune-mediated protection against disease, in particular diseases of the mucosa, and the mechanisms by which the minerals or their deficiency exert their effect on immunity. Research is also required into the possibility that animals in the process of acquiring gut immunity have higher requirements for minerals.	0
9279478	Insulin degradation by Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing the insulin receptor. Prior studies have shown that Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) overexpressing the human insulin receptor bind and respond normally to insulin (T.C. Yeh, R.A. Roth, Diabetes 43 (1994) 1297-1303). Moreover, the insulin receptor preferentially localizes to the basolateral membrane of these cells. In the present studies, insulin was added to either the apical or the basolateral side of these cells and the extent of degradation of the insulin was assessed. Radioactive insulin added to either side was bound to its receptor and the radioactivity which reached the other side of the cell was to a large extent degraded fragments. Insulin added to the apical side was degraded to a larger extent (83%) than when added to the basolateral side (49%) although the basolateral side has much more insulin receptors than the apical side. This degradation process was not inhibitors of either lysosomal enzymes, the proteasome complex or cathepsins. The degradation process could however, be potently inhibited by the sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide. Further, cell surface biotinylation study showed that the insulin degrading enzyme was preferentially localized on the apical membranes. These results suggest that insulin added on the apical side of MDCK cells are more closely linked to the degradation process than that added on the basolateral side.	0
16723222	Effects of acetylation, polymerase phosphorylation, and DNA unwinding in glucocorticoid receptor transactivation. Varying the concentration of selected factors alters the induction properties of steroid receptors by changing the position of the dose-response curve (or the value for half-maximal induction=EC(50)) and the amount of partial agonist activity of antisteroids. We now describe a rudimentary mathematical model that predicts a simple Michaelis-Menten curve for the multi-step process of steroid-regulated gene induction. This model suggests that steps far downstream from receptor binding to steroid can influence the EC(50) of agonist-complexes and partial agonist activity of antagonist-complexes. We therefore asked whether inhibitors of three possible downstream steps can reverse the effects of increased concentrations of two factors: glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and Ubc9. The downstream steps (with inhibitors in parentheses) are protein deacetylation (TSA and VPA), DNA unwinding (CPT), and CTD phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (DRB and H8). None of the inhibitors mimic or prevent the effects of added GRs. However, inhibitors of DNA unwinding and CTD phosphorylation do reverse the effects of Ubc9 with high GR concentrations. These results support our earlier conclusion that different rate-limiting steps operate at low and high GR concentrations versus high GR with Ubc9. The present data also suggest that downstream steps can modulate the EC(50) of GR-mediated induction, thus both supporting the utility of our mathematical model and widening the field of biochemical processes that can modify the EC(50).	0
16924897	Oncocytic schneiderian papilloma found in a recurrent chronic paranasal sinusitis. Oncocytic schneiderian papilloma (OSP), also known as cylindrical cell papilloma, is a rare benign sinonasal neoplasm. Due to its rare incidence, this disease is not well-understood by clinicians. The probability of malignancies arising in OSP is not low but they are rarely encountered in clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, there is no documentation of OSP associated with recurrent chronic paranasal sinusitis (CPS). We hereby report an unusual case of OSP in a 28 year-old man which was first diagnosed and treated as recurrent chronic paranasal sinusitis. After three surgeries, OSP was revealed in the pathological findings and the tumor was completely resected endoscopically in the fourth operation. There was no sign of recurrence after two years of follow-up. A thorough review of histopathological slides from the first two surgeries showed no sign of OSP in these tissue sections. We present this case to remind clinicians that OSP can be found with inflammatory polyps in CPS, and it is easily overlooked clinically. Nevertheless, sufficient alertness from both the surgeon and pathologist is the cornerstone for the proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment of this rare nasal neoplasm.	0
12224572	Molecular epidemiology of malaria in Cameroon. X. Evaluation of PFMDR1 mutations as genetic markers for resistance to amino alcohols and artemisinin derivatives. Mutations at five positions in the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug-resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1), initially thought to confer resistance to chloroquine, have been associated with in vitro resistance to amino alcohols and artemisinin derivatives in more recent studies. To assess the possible association between drug resistance phenotype and pfmdrl polymorphisms and establish the baseline pfmdr1 sequence data in Yaound  , Cameroon, the in vitro drug sensitivity pattern was determined for 64 clinical isolates by isotopic microtest. The pfmdr1 alleles were determined by a polymerase chain reaction and automatic sequencing. A large majority of isolates carried Tyr-86 (88%) and Phe-184 (91%) alleles. With the exception of one isolate with mixed codon 1246, all isolates had wild-type alleles Ser-1034, Asn-1042, and Asp-1246. There was no statistical association between codons 86 and 184 and in vitro response to chloroquine, amino alcohols, and artemisinin derivatives (P > 0.05). Our data do not seem to support the hypothesis that mutations in codons 86 and 184 influence the in vitro response to these drugs. Further monitoring of both in vitro response and pfmdrl polymorphisms is required to evaluate the potential role played by other pfmdr1 alleles in the determination of drug resistance in Africa.	0

16526272	[St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) in sarcoidosis patients]. INTRODUCTION: Sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystem disorder which has a great impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL). Patients with sarcoidosis very often present with bronchial obstruction. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of respiratory disorder on general HRQL using St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 129 patients with histologically proven sarcoidosis. All patients underwent clinical examination, chest X-ray and spirometry, and in all skin prick tests and sera ACE and IgE were determined. Afterwards, they filled out SGRQ, and scores were compared with clinical and radiological findings, and also with serum markers of the disease. RESULTS: Mean activity score values were significantly lower in men, in patients with newly diagnosed disease, and in patients with elevated ACE. Patients with extrathoracic disease had significantly higher scores. Clinical course showed significant correlation with impact and total score, and the number of relapses with the activity score. SGRQ scores significantly correlated with serum IgE and with most spirometric parameters. CONCLUSION: Our data revealed a high validity of SGRQ in patients with sarcoidosis and a great influence of respiratory disorders on general health-related quality of life in these patients. However, reproducibility and responsiveness of SGRQ is yet to be established in patients with sarcoidosis.	0
22730423	Cascade reactions forming highly substituted, conjugated phospholes and 1,2-oxaphospholes. More than just a carbon copy: The reaction of a phospha-Wittig-Horner reagent with diacetylenic ketones (see scheme) results in a cascade of reactions that can lead to both an oxaphosphole-terminated cumulene system and an alkene-bridged bis-phosphole. The reaction outcome is determined by the nature of the acetylene termini, with phenyl groups stabilizing a carbene intermediate that dimerizes to give the bis-phosphole product.	0
22456796	A single-nucleotide polymorphism in ANK1 is associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Japanese populations. To identify a novel susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes, we performed an imputation-based, genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a Japanese population using newly obtained imputed-genotype data for 2 229 890 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) estimated from previously reported, directly genotyped GWAS data in the same samples (stage 1: 4470 type 2 diabetes versus 3071 controls). We directly genotyped 43 new SNPs with P-values of <10(-4) in a part of stage-1 samples (2692 type 2 diabetes versus 3071 controls), and the associations of validated SNPs were evaluated in another 11 139 Japanese individuals (stage 2: 7605 type 2 diabetes versus 3534 controls). Combined meta-analysis using directly genotyped data for stages 1 and 2 revealed that rs515071 in ANK1 and rs7656416 near MGC21675 were associated with type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population at the genome-wide significant level (P < 5 * 10(-8)). The association of rs515071 was also observed in European GWAS data (combined P for all populations = 6.14 * 10(-10)). Rs7656416 was in linkage disequilibrium to rs6815464, which had recently been identified as a top signal in a meta-analysis of East Asian GWAS for type 2 diabetes (r(2) = 0.76 in stage 2). The association of rs7656416 with type 2 diabetes disappeared after conditioning on rs6815464. These results indicate that the ANK1 locus is a new, common susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes across different ethnic groups. The signal of association was weaker in the directly genotyped data, so the improvement in signal indicates the importance of imputation in this particular case.	0
7583708	Suppression of tumor cell growth by anthocyanins in vitro. Bioflavonoids, extracted from flower petals, were examined for their growth inhibitory effect on cells in culture. They were found to significantly suppress the growth of the cultured cells. Anthocyanins tended to show greater inhibitory effect than other flavonoids. Commercially synthesized or purified aglycones of flavonoids were also studied for their suppression of tumor cells. The anthocyanins were more effective than other flavonoid aglycones, although the aglycones were easily inactivated under the culture conditions.	0
11146265	Evaluation of explicit criteria for total hip joint replacement. We tested an appropriateness of indications tool for total hip joint replacement in patients with osteoarthritis. Criteria were developed using a modified Delphi panel judgment process. Ratings were analyzed regarding level of agreement among panelists. Another panel rated the same indications; results were compared with the main panel. Test-retest of the main panel was performed. Regression models were used to assess the contribution of each algorithm variable. Appropriateness indication judgment was applied to 84 patients and compared to health-related quality-of-life improvement before and 3 months following intervention. Main panel ratings compared to those of a second panel resulted in a kappa statistic of 0.77. Test-retest kappa for the main panel was 0.81. Patients considered appropriate candidates for surgery, based on their composite indication scores, showed more improvement in health-related quality of life after 3 months than those considered inappropriately by composite indication scores. The previous parameters tested showed acceptable results for an evaluation tool. These results support the use of this indications algorithm as a screening tool for assessing the appropriateness of hip replacement surgery in osteoarthritis.	0
24411791	Decisional regret after robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy is higher in African American men. OBJECTIVES: Longitudinal studies report racial disparities in prostate cancer (PCa) including greater incidence, more aggressive tumor biology, and increased cancer-specific mortality in African American (AA) men. Regret concerning primary treatment selection is underevaluated in patients with PCa. We investigated the relationships between clinicopathologic variables across racial and socioeconomic lines following robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed treatment decisional regret using a validated questionnaire in a total of 484 white and 72 AA patients with PCa who were followed up for a median of 16.6 months post-robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy. Socioeconomic status (SES) information was aggregated from 2010 US census zip code data. Perioperative clinicopathologic characteristics and functional outcomes were compared between groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate the influence of race, aggregate SES, and other clinical and demographic characteristics on decisional regret. RESULTS: The majority (87.7%) of the population was not regretful of their decision to undergo treatment. However, a greater proportion of AA vs. white patients were regretful (20.6% vs. 11.2%, respectively; P = 0.03). AA and white men were similar on all functional, clinical, and pathologic features with the exception of younger age among AA men (56 vs. 60 y, respectively; P<0.001). Although there were significant differences in SES by race (P<0.001), regret did not differ by SES (b =-1.53; P = 0.15). Race, postoperative sexual dysfunction, pad usage, and length of hospital stay, however, were significantly associated with decisional regret. CONCLUSIONS: AA men were more regretful than white men, after adjusting for clinicopathologic characteristics and postoperative functional outcomes.	0
18552205	Differential cell fates induced by all-trans retinoic acid-treated HL-60 human leukemia cells. HL-60 human leukemia cells, differentiated into a neutrophil lineage by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, express three members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family, CEA-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1; CD66a), CEACAM3 (CD66d), and CEACAM6 (CD66c). CD66d is a neutrophil lineage-specific marker, and CD66a and CD66c are found on epithelial and other cells. HL-60 cells continuously treated with ATRA underwent apoptosis, and cells transiently treated for 1 day underwent cell-cycle arrest, entered into senescence, and exhibited reduced apoptosis with CD66-positive cells accounting for the majority of live cells. CD66 antigens were also induced in NB4 leukemic cells upon continuous treatment with ATRA. NB4 cells underwent apoptosis with a higher frequency in transient versus continuous-treated cells (38% vs. 19% at Day 5), in contrast to HL-60 cells that underwent cell-cycle arrest and senescence when transiently treated with ATRA. CD66 antigens were not induced in transient, ATRA-treated NB4 cells compared with HL-60 cells. Cell-cycle arrest in HL-60 cells involved reduction in expression levels of p21, cyclins D and E, while Rb1 exhibited reduction in protein levels without changes in mRNA levels over the time course of ATRA treatment. Analysis of several proapoptotic proteins implicated the activation of calpain and cleavage of Bax in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, similar to published studies about the apoptosis of neutrophils. CD1d expression was also induced by ATRA in HL-60 cells and ligation with anti-CD1d antibody-induced apoptosis. In contrast, CD1d-positive primary monocytes were protected from spontaneous apoptosis by CD1d ligation. These studies demonstrate distinct cell fates for ATRA-treated HL-60 cells that provide new insights into ATRA-induced cell differentiation.	0
18460396	The incidence of shopping cart-related injuries in the United States, 2002--2006. BACKGROUND: Shopping cart-related injuries are an important cause of childhood injury in the United States (US). To date, few studies have investigated the epidemiology and incidence of these injuries. METHODS: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was utilized to identify shopping cart-related injuries from 2002 to 2006. Injury rates were calculated using the 2006 US population estimates for gender (male and female), age group (<5 years, 5-9 years, and 10-14 years), and race (White, Black, and other). RESULTS: The overall injury rate was 37.8 per 100,000 person years (PY). Injury rates did not differ significantly by gender or race. However, injury rates decreased markedly with increasing age and were highest among children <5 years of age (97.8 per 100,000 PY), followed by children 5-9 years (13.9 per 100,000 PY), and children 10-14 years (2.9 per 100,000 PY). CONCLUSIONS: Shopping carts continue to be an important cause of injuries among children. Directing safety awareness toward those families with children <5 years, mandatory safety standards, and modification of shopping cart design may decrease injury rates.	0

9722322	Oral contraception and eye disease: findings in two large cohort studies. The relationship between oral contraceptive (OC) use and eye disease was investigated through abstraction of salient data from the two large British cohort studies of the effects of OCs: the Royal College of General Practitioners' (RCGP) OC Study and the Oxford-Family Planning Association (FPA) Contraception Study. Together, these studies have accumulated over 850,000 person-years of observation since 1968 involving 63,000 women. The conditions considered in the analysis were conjunctivitis, keratitis, iritis, lacrimal disease, strabismus, cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and retinal vascular lesions. The only eye disease for which there was consistent evidence of a notable increase in risk in OC users was retinal vascular lesions. The relative risk of retinal vascular lesions in OC users compared to never users was 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-3.8) in the RCGP data set and 2.4 (95% CI, 0.4-9.2) in the Oxford-FPA Study. This increased risk was not concentrated in any one diagnostic category (e.g., retinal vascular occlusion, retinal vein thrombosis, retinal hemorrhage).	0
23194869	Toxicity and safety evaluation of boswellic acids. The acute, sub-acute and chronic toxicity studies on boswellic acids (BAs) were carried out on mice, rats and monkeys. BAs did not cause any mortality in rats and mice when administered orally and intraperitoneally in doses up to 2 g/kg. Daily oral administration of BAs in three doses (low and very high) to rats and monkeys revealed no significant changes in general behaviour, or clinical, haematological, biochemical and pathological data. BAs, therefore, can be regarded as safe for clinical studies.	0
8339784	Specific functions of grafted locus coeruleus neurons in the kindling model of epilepsy. Grafts of fetal noradrenaline (NA)-rich locus coeruleus (LC) tissue implanted bilaterally into the hippocampus in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treated, hyperexcitable rats retard seizure development in hippocampal kindling. We report that bilateral intrahippocampal LC grafts failed to affect the severity of seizures when implanted in 6-OHDA-treated, already kindled rats. Furthermore, a noradrenergic hyperinnervation of the hippocampus, produced by grafting fetal LC tissue into the intact brain, did not influence hippocampal kindling development. Kindling leads to long-term reduction in basal hippocampal NA release from the intrinsic locus coeruleus system as monitored using intracerebral microdialysis. This deficit could be reversed by intrahippocampal LC grafts implanted into previously kindled rats. However, these unilateral grafts had no effect on the severity of the kindled convulsions despite a noradrenergic hyperinnervation of the hippocampus around the grafts. In conclusion, these data show a distinct functional specificity of intrahippocampal LC grafts in the kindling model of epilepsy. Similar to the intrinsic noradrenergic system, the grafted neurons have a major inhibitory influence on seizure development but are ineffective against established convulsions.	0

17385689	Effect of cooling on thixotropic position-sense error in human biceps muscle. Muscle temperature affects muscle thixotropy. However, it is unclear whether changes in muscle temperature affect thixotropic position-sense errors. We studied the effect of cooling on thixotropic position-sense errors induced by short-length muscle contraction (hold-short conditioning) in the biceps of 12 healthy men. After hold-short conditioning of the right biceps muscle in a cooled (5.0 degrees C) or control (36.5 degrees C) environment, subjects perceived greater extension of the conditioned forearm at 5.0 degrees C. The angle differences between the two forearms following hold-short conditioning of the right biceps muscle in normal or cooled conditions were significantly different (-3.335 +/- 1.680 degrees at 36.5 degrees C vs. -5.317 +/- 1.096 degrees at 5.0 degrees C; P=0.043). Induction of a tonic vibration reflex in the biceps muscle elicited involuntary forearm elevation, and the angular velocities of the elevation differed significantly between arms conditioned in normal and cooled environments (1.583 +/- 0.326 degrees /s at 36.5 degrees C vs. 3.100 +/- 0.555 degrees /s at 5.0 degrees C, P=0.0039). Thus, a cooled environment impairs a muscle's ability to provide positional information, potentially leading to poor muscle performance.	0

22013951	Photoactivated uranyl ion produces single strand breaks in plasmid DNA. Uranium is an important emerging toxicant whose use has outpaced the rate at which we are learning about its health effects. One unexplored pathway for uranium toxicity involves the photoactivation of uranyl ion by UV light to produce U(5+) and oxygen radicals. The purpose of this study was to provide proof of principle data by testing the hypothesis that coexposures of DNA to uranyl acetate and UVB irradiation should produce more DNA strand breaks than individual exposures. Results supported the hypothesis and suggest that investigations of uranium toxicity be expanded to include skin as a potential target organ for carcinogenesis, especially in populations with high uranium and high UV radiation exposures.	0

10973447	Comparison of five serologic tests for diagnosis of acute infections by Chlamydia pneumoniae. Serology is often used to diagnose acute infections by Chlamydia pneumoniae. In this study paired sera from patients with acute respiratory tract infection during an epidemic of C. pneumoniae infections were examined by five different antibody tests. These tests were the complement fixation (CF) test, the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test, a recombinant enzyme immunoassay (rEIA) (Medac) based on a recombinant lipopolysaccharide of chlamydia and measuring antibodies to a common chlamydial antigen, and two tests that utilize preparations of C. pneumoniae organisms, the SeroCp-EIA (Savyon) (with preserved lipopolysaccharide) and the LOY-EIA (Labsystems) (without this antigen). Both of the last two tests should measure specific antibodies to C. pneumoniae, although cross-reacting antibodies may also be detected by the SeroCp-EIA. Acute infection of C. pneumoniae was serologically confirmed in 44% of the cases by at least two different tests. Using an expanded \"gold standard,\" i.e., the presence of significant reactions in at least two tests, the sensitivity of the CF test was 69%, that of the MIF test was 88%, that of the rEIA was 89%, that of the LOY-EIA was 96%, and that of the SeroCp-EIA was 92%. Specificity was high for all methods, but adjustments of diagnostic criteria were made to several of the tests. The basis for these adjustments and supportive data are presented. Infections of C. pneumoniae were detected in patients from 8 to 83 years of age. Two peaks in the incidence of such infections were observed: one among young teenagers and a second in adults 30 to 45 years of age, corresponding to parents of young teen-agers. The tests were equally sensitive in different age groups. Reinfections seemed to be rare.	0
7020252	Primary isolation of a new strain of the TATLOCK/Pittsburgh pneumonia agent (Legionella micdadei). Pneumonia, empyema and lung abscesses developed in a patient following a neurosurgical procedure and associated short-term corticosteroid therapy. An organism identical to the TATLOCK/Pittsburgh pneumonia agent (Legionella micdadei) was the only organism isolated from multiple specimens from lung aspirates and chest tube drainage. The organism was isolated directly on charcoal yeast extract (CYE) agar and classified as identical to the TATLOCK bacterium by direct immunofluorescent staining and by gas-liquid chromatography of cellular fatty acids. The patient's pulmonary infection improved during treatment with penicillin. Serum specimens obtained from the patient during convalescence showed an indirect fluorescent antibody reciprocal titer of 16,000 to his homologous antigen, but he also had titers that were potentially diagnostic against antigens of the six serogroups of Legionella pneumophila and three other Legionella-like organisms. Legionella can be isolated from clinical specimens by the routine use of CYE agar, which should be incorporated as the primary isolation medium for chest fluids and lung specimens. It appears that a large battery of antigens will be required for serological testing to diagnose infections caused by L micadei, L pneumophila and Legionella-like organisms.	0

The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical limitations of both anatomical and electrophysiological approaches. METHODS: A total of 110 PVs were ablated in 26 consecutive patients (23 male, 3 female, mean age 51 +/- 9.5 years) with paroxysmal (n = 19, 73%), persistent (n = 3, 12%) or permanent (n = 4, 15%) AF. Accurate reconstructions of the PV ostia were obtained using fluoroscopy, electrophysiology, and the CARTO mapping system. Electrophysiological mapping was attempted in all PVs by means of a decapolar circular catheter. RF ablation was performed in a single-blind fashion in order to anatomically create circumferential lines around each PV. Completeness of anatomically-guided, circumferential RF lesions around the PVs was established by the physician using the CARTO system, who was unaware of the decapolar circular catheter electrophysiological recordings of the PVs. If PV potentials persisted, RF delivery was targeted to the electrophysiological breakthroughs. RESULTS: All PV ostia were anatomically ablated by performing circumferential RF lesions. Among 110 PVs, 73 (66%) were fully mapped by use of circular catheters. After anatomical ablation, electrical disconnection was achieved in 44/73 PVs (60%). In the remaining 29 PVs (40%), a median of one RF pulse (mean 1.8 +/- 1.4) was necessary to achieve complete PV disconnection. Total procedure duration, fluoroscopy time, and RF delivery time were 232 +/- 29, 50 +/- 16 and 39 +/- 11 min, respectively. Pericardial effusion occurred in one patient after the procedure. After 10.5 +/- 6.4 months, 21 patients (81%) were in stable sinus rhythm and 13 of them (62%) discontinued all drugs after 6 months. Only 4 patients (15%) required two procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Electrical PV disconnection cannot be achieved in many PVs by means of a pure anatomical approach. On the other hand, electrophysiological mapping cannot be performed in many PVs owing to anatomical variations. An integrated approach might overcome these limitations.	0

9922701	[T validity of the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in children under two years of age]. In the Department of Paediatrics at Hiller  d a valid diagnosis of urinary tract infection in children is defined to be at least 10.000 bacteria/ml. in two midstream specimens of urine or any bacterial growth in urine collected by a suprapubic aspiration or by bladder catheterisation. We decided to study if these criteria were fulfilled in our department, which takes care of urinary tract infections in children in the county of Frederiksborg with a catchment area of about 350.000 people. From 1994-1996 a total of 60 children younger than two years of age were treated for their first suspected urinary tract infection. The diagnosis was valid in 37% of the cases. Eighty-eight percent of the children received parenteral antibiotics for at least three days, and 86% were discharged with prophylactic antibiotics. All underwent urological ultrasonographic examination and 70% underwent an isotope micturition cystourethrography. Among patients with a valid diagnosis 68% were boys and 50% had urological abnormalities, whereas among patients without a valid diagnosis there were 33% boys (p < 0.025) and 24% had urological abnormalities (p = 0.0734). A valid diagnosis of a first urinary tract infection was established in 0.15% of children younger than two years of age in the county of Frederiksborg. This is lower than previously reported. The problem of false positive urinary tract infections thus may be important in general.	0
21451435	Copy number variations in affective disorders and meta-analysis. In two recent studies 10 copy number variants (CNV) were found to be overrepresented either among patients suffering from affective disorders in an Amish family or in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium study. Here, we investigate if these variants are associated with affective disorders in a combined analysis of three case-control samples from Denmark, Norway and Iceland. A total of 1897 cases (n=1223 unipolar and n=463 bipolar) and 11 231 controls were analyzed for CNVs at the 10 genomic loci, but we found no combined association between these CNVs and affective disorders.	0

9288479	Field-to-microphone transfer functions for completely-in-the-canal (CIC) instruments. OBJECTIVE: To measure the field-to-microphone transfer function for two sizes of completely-in-the-canal (CIC) devices, at two loudspeaker azimuths. DESIGN: Field-to-microphone transfer functions were measured for both standard- and micro-CIC instruments, at 0 degree and 45 degrees azimuth, in a sample of 24 adults. This was accomplished with custom instruments, which allowed for a direct connection between the CIC microphone electrical output and the measurement/analysis instrumentation system. RESULTS: For the standard-CIC, the peak in the average field-to-microphone transfer function was 8 dB at 4000 Hz for 0 degree azimuth and 13.7 dB at 5000 Hz for 45 degrees azimuth. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate and define, at two signal azimuths, the acoustic advantage of the CIC microphone placement relative to that reported for alternative hearing aid styles.	0

15891539	Anterior knee pain after intramedullary nailing of a tibial shaft fracture: an ultrasound study of the patellar tendons of 36 patients. OBJECTIVES: Chronic anterior knee pain is a common complication following intramedullary nailing of a tibial shaft fracture. The etiology of pain is often not known. This study sonographically examined the patellar tendons of patients with a nailed tibial shaft fracture. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty consecutive patients with a nailed tibial shaft fracture were initially included in the study. Thirty-six of them could be measured at an average of 2.5 +/- 0.5 years after nail insertion (1.0 +/- 0.3 years after nail extraction). INTERVENTION: Reamed intramedullary nailing with 2 interlocking bolts at both ends of the nail (Grosse-Kempf-nail, Howmedica). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The ultrasound investigation of the patellar tendons of the 36 patients. RESULTS: Twelve (33%) patients were painless and 24 (67%) patients had anterior knee pain at follow-up. With the reference to the mean difference in the thickness of the distal part of the patellar tendon in the operated limb versus nonoperated limb, the result was 1.4 +/- 1.1 mm in the chronic pain group and 2.6 +/- 2.5 mm in the painless group (P = 0.135, [95% confidence interval for the group difference = -0.4-2.8]). The corresponding values for the proximal part of the patellar tendon was 1.4 +/- 1.3 mm in the chronic pain group and 2.3 +/- 2.3 mm in the painless group (P = 0.251, [95% confidence interval for the group difference = -0.7-2.4]). There were no statistically significantly differences between study groups in the blood circulation of the patellar tendon or at the entry point, calcification of the patellar tendon, granulation tissue at the entry point, or occurrence of low echo areas in the patellar tendon. CONCLUSION: After intramedullary nailing of a tibial shaft fracture, patients with or without anterior knee pain show similar changes in the ultrasound investigation of their patellar tendons. Based on those findings, it does not appear to make any difference as to the approach used (paratendinous or transtendinous) for intramedullary nailing of the tibia.	0
9679118	Dietary Estrogens Act through Estrogen Receptor-Mediated Processes and Show No Antiestrogenicity in Cultured Breast Cancer Cells. Dietary estrogens are believed to exert their estrogenic or antiestrogenic (chemopreventive) action in estrogen responsive cells by interacting with the estrogen receptor (ER). The present study was undertaken to evaluate a direct role of ER in estrogenic or antiestrogenic activities of three dietary estrogens (coumestrol, genistein and zearalenone). HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with an expression vector for ER and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene construct. Coumestrol, genistein, and zearalenone all increased the activity of the reporter gene, only in the presence of the ER, and the activation was blocked with the ER antagonist ICI 164,384, demonstrating an ER-specific, agonist response. In addition, in MCF-7 cells, coumestrol and zearalenone increased the expression of the estrogen-responsive pS2 gene. Coumestrol and genistein inhibited the purified estrogen-specific 17  -hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase enzyme and the conversion of estrone to 17  -estradiol in T-47D cells, which contain this enzyme. However, they did not inhibit the estrone-induced proliferation of T-47D cells. In conclusion, coumestrol, genistein, and zearalenone are all potent estrogens in vitro, and they act through ER mediated mechanism. Our findings give no evidence to support the idea that these compounds act as antiestrogens through competition for the binding sites of ER or by inhibition of the conversion of estrone to 17  -estradiol in breast cancer cells, since this effect was nullified by their agonist action on cell proliferation. Therefore, their suggested chemopreventive action in estrogen-related cancers must be mediated through other mechanisms.	0

10478398	Impediments to the enforcement of youth access laws. OBJECTIVE: To recognise obstacles to the implementation of the effective enforcement of tobacco sales laws and to identify measures that could be taken to overcome these obstacles. DESIGN: Interviews were conducted with health department officials in Massachusetts communities to determine why their efforts to prevent illegal sales of tobacco to minors had been only partially successful. SETTING: Urban, suburban, and rural communities in Massachusetts, USA. RESULTS: Organisational problems, court challenges to citations, budgetary threats, and political pressure all combined to reduce the frequency of enforcement inspections to half the intended rate. Political pressure resulted in the exclusion of older youths from compliance tests, further undermining enforcement efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Suggestions for addressing the problems include obtaining support from the community, keeping elected and court officials informed about plans for merchant education and law enforcement, using efficient enforcement protocols, setting merchant compliance goals, and advising the public and government officials about progress towards those goals, using older youths to make purchase attempts, and testing all merchants frequently.	0
9335284	The presence of a dnaK (HSP70) multigene family in members of the orders Planctomycetales and Verrucomicrobiales. Sequences of the dnaK gene, coding for the 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), were determined for six members of the order Planctomycetales, including representatives of three genera, and for the only cultivated member of the order Verrucomicrobiales, Verrucomicrobium spinosum. A fragment of the dnaK gene was amplified from these strains by PCR with oligonucleotide primers targeting regions of the dnaK gene that are conserved at the amino acid level, and the resulting PCR products were cloned into a plasmid vector. Sequence analysis of the cloned dnaK fragments revealed the presence of two different types of dnaK sequence in one of the planctomycete strains, Planctomyces maris, and in V. spinosum. Only one type of dnaK sequence was found for each of the remaining strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial sequence data suggested that the majority of planctomycete strains, including one of the Planctomyces maris sequences, form a coherent phylogenetic group branching adjacent to other main lines of descent within the domain Bacteria, as has been shown previously by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. One of the two V. spinosum dnaK sequences also appears to constitute a separate lineage within the gram-negative bacteria. Each of the remaining sequences from P. maris and V. spinosum, together with the single sequence obtained from Planctomyces limnophilus, appeared to be unrelated to the other planctomycete sequences and to occupy a position distant from that of other gram-negative bacteria. The phylogenetic diversity of dnaK sequences exhibited by P. maris and V. spinosum was comparable to that found in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC7942 and Escherichia coli, the only other prokaryotes for which a dnaK multigene family has been demonstrated.	0
8915842	Spatial and temporal shifts in the regulation of neurogenesis in a peripheral ganglion. In the cardiac ganglion of the frog Xenopus laevis, the number of cholinergic neurons increases over several months. During this time, each neuron must insert itself into the control circuit of the functioning heart. Like all neurons, increases in cell number depend on the timing of both proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursors. The characteristics of the cardiac ganglion provided an opportunity to test how proliferation and differentiation regulate the production of a specific population of neurons. The prolonged accumulation of cardiac neurons suggested that their site of origin shifted from the neural crest migratory pathway to the heart at later stages of development. 3H-thymidine labeling of neurons in organ culture confirmed that neuronal precursors in the heart divide over a period of at least 3 weeks of development. Quantitative analysis of individual cardiac neurons subjected to different labeling and sampling protocols provided an estimate of their cell cycle length. It also showed that the rate of neuron proliferation during normal development matched the rate of neuron accumulation. Labeling DNA and blocking its synthesis indicated that the time of cardiac neuron differentiation was variable, but the range did not change as the site of cardiac neurogenesis shifted. On the other hand, the regular proliferation of cardiac neuron precursors during the first few days of development slowed or stopped at later times. This change in regulation of neuronal precursor proliferation occurred during their change in location.	0

11933598	Interventional radiology procedures in the liver. Biopsy, drainage, and ablation. Radiologically guided interventional procedures in the liver have continually increased, in number and variety, over the years. Factors promoting these advances include new technology, innovative ideas, and growing acceptance by clinicians and patients. Percutaneous biopsy and drainage procedures are firmly established techniques with low complication rates. Ablation by injected substances is useful for treating certain tumor types. The most exciting development is the introduction of percutaneous thermal techniques for tumor ablation. Although more experience is needed to optimize the use of focal thermal ablation, early results seem promising.	0
22033753	Occurrence, source apportionment and toxicity assessment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in surface sediments of Chaohu, one of the most polluted lakes in China. In order to evaluate the effect of local anthropogenic activities on Chaohu Lake, one of the most eutrophicated lakes in China, surface sediments have been collected from the whole lake with 0.05   0.05 degree latitude/longitude resolution and in the estuaries of three main inflowing rivers. The concentrations of the 28 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) determined were in a range 82.4-13,000 ng g(-1) with an average value of 1670 ng g(-1) dry weight for total 28 PAHs (referred to as   (28)PAH). Amongst the 28 PAHs, 16 are listed as high priority PAHs by the USEPA and they were in the range of 60.8-10,200 ng g(-1) with an average value of 1230 ng g(-1) for the total of them (referred to as   (16)PAH); 7 are known as carcinogenic PAHs and their levels ranged from 34.2 to 6400 ng g(-1) with an average of 815 ng g(-1) in total (referred to as   (7)PAH). Chaohu Lake was considered significantly polluted by PAHs through the comparison with the PAH burdens in fresh-water lakes both in China and worldwide. Toxic units (TUs) evaluation showed some sampling locations possibly were over the median lethal level for benthic invertebrate. The highest PAH concentrations were found in sediments from the Nanfei River estuary, suggesting the major contributor of PAHs contamination to the lake. The PAHs with four and five rings were found to be dominant among the PAHs detected in all of the sediment samples, and perylene was the most abundant.   (16)PAH had a good correlation with those PAHs from pyrogenic sources, such as anthracene and phenanthrene, but a poor correlation with perylene. The results demonstrated that the environmental behavior of PAHs from pyrogenic sources is significantly different to that of perylene from diagenetic sources. The PAHs in sediments were mainly from traffic-related emission by qualitatively assessing with the diagnostic ratios of PAH isomers, and the ratios for low molecular weight PAHs were strongly altered during their transport.	0
20003150	Cardiac awareness and autonomic cardiac reactivity during emotional picture viewing and mental stress. This study investigated the relationship between autonomic cardiovascular reactivity and cardiac awareness during the following conditions: baseline, emotional picture viewing, mental stress, and heartbeat tracking. Cardiac parameters were examined by using power spectrum analysis of heart rate variability and impedance cardiography. According to their performance in a heartbeat tracking task, 38 participants were classified as good (n=19) or poor (n=19) heartbeat perceivers. Neither group differed during baseline and heartbeat tracking, but good compared to poor heartbeat perceivers demonstrated greater sympathetic reactivity during mental stress and more vagal reactivity and subjective arousal during emotional picture viewing. The results suggest that cardiac awareness is related to greater responsivity of the autonomic nervous system during situations evoking autonomic reactivity.	0
11495500	The pharmacokinetics of glycyrrhizic acid evaluated by physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. Glycyrrhizic acid is widely applied as a sweetener in food products and chewing tobacco. In addition, it is of clinical interest for possible treatment of chronic hepatitis C. In some highly exposed subjects, side effects such as hypertension and symptoms associated with electrolyte disturbances have been reported. To analyze the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of glycyrrhizic acid in its toxicity, the kinetics of glycyrrhizic acid and its biologically active metabolite glycyrrhetic acid were evaluated. Glycyrrhizic acid is mainly absorbed after presystemic hydrolysis as glycyrrhetic acid. Because glycyrrhetic acid is a 200-1000 times more potent inhibitor of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase compared to glycyrrhizic acid, the kinetics of glycyrrhetic acid are relevant in a toxicological perspective. Once absorbed, glycyrrhetic acid is transported, mainly taken up into the liver by capacity-limited carriers, where it is metabolized into glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. These conjugates are transported efficiently into the bile. After outflow of the bile into the duodenum, the conjugates are hydrolyzed to glycyrrhetic acid by commensal bacteria; glycyrrhetic acid is subsequently reabsorbed, causing a pronounced delay in the terminal plasma clearance. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling indicated that, in humans, the transit rate of gastrointestinal contents through the small and large intestines predominantly determines to what extent glycyrrhetic acid conjugates will be reabsorbed. This parameter, which can be estimated noninvasively, may serve as a useful risk estimator for glycyrrhizic-acid-induced adverse effects, because in subjects with prolonged gastrointestinal transit times, glycyrrhetic acid might accumulate after repeated intake.	0
22858236	Interest in cosmetic vulvar surgery and perception of vulvar appearance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether reproductive-age women are more likely to perceive their vulva as abnormal compared with older-aged women. STUDY DESIGN: Women aged 18-44 years (group 1) and 45-72 years (group 2) completed a survey on demographics, grooming patterns, vulvar perceptions, and source of information about the vulva. RESULTS: There was no difference between group 1 and group 2 in how often women looked at their vulva or their perception of having a normal vulva (91% vs 93%, P = .76). Both groups were satisfied with the appearance of their vulva (81% vs 82%, P = .71). A higher percentage in group 2 would consider cosmetic surgery if cost were not an issue versus group 1 (15% vs 8%, P = .05). CONCLUSION: A woman's age does not have an impact on her perception of a normal vulva. The majority of women perceived their vulva to be normal and were satisfied with its appearance. However, older women are more interested in cosmetic vulvar surgery.	0

17920542	Corticosteroids for multiple sclerosis: I. Application for treating exacerbations. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder characterized by a multiphasic course of neurological exacerbations, periods of clinical remission, and, in most patients, ultimately progressive deterioration of functional capabilities. The relapsing-remitting phase of the disease involves acute interruption in neurological functioning relating to areas of inflammation in discrete central-tract systems. The treatment of MS exacerbations with anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids and adrenocorticotropic hormone has represented an established practice throughout the neurology community. Although there is scientific rationale supporting application of these agents for this purpose, the broad diversity of approaches to using these drugs in clinical practice is a derivative of expert opinion and anecdotal experience. Ultimately, the treatment of MS-related exacerbations is part science, but mostly art. This review discusses the pharmacology of these agents, to better understand how they may act to mitigate attacks and to provide some practical formulations for how to use them in the clinic for the benefit of patients.	0
19416292	Geographical variation in serological responses to recombinant Pneumocystis jirovecii major surface glycoprotein antigens. The use of recombinant fragments of the major surface glycoprotein (Msg) of Pneumocystis jirovecii has proven useful for studying serological immune responses of blood donors and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive (HIV(+)) patients. Here, we have used ELISA to measure antibody titres to Msg fragments (MsgA, MsgB, MsgC1, MsgC3, MsgC8 and MsgC9) in sera isolated in the USA (n=200) and Spain (n=326), to determine whether geographical location affects serological responses to these antigens. Blood donors from Seville exhibited a significantly greater antibody titre to MsgC8, and significantly lower responses to MsgC3 and MsgC9, than did Cincinnati (USA) donors. Spanish blood donors (n=162) also exhibited elevated responses to MsgC1, MsgC8 and MsgC9 as compared with Spanish HIV(+) (n=164) patients. HIV(+) patients who had Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP(+)) exhibited a higher response to MsgC8 than did HIV(+) PcP(-) patients. These data show that geographical location plays a role in responsiveness to Msg fragments. Additionally, these fragments have utility in differentiating HIV(+) PcP and HIV(+) PcP(+) among patient populations.	0
8157966	Cloning of two adenosine receptor subtypes from mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells. Adenosine potentiates the stimulated release of mast cell mediators. Pharmacologic studies suggest the presence of two adenosine receptors, one positively coupled to adenylate cyclase and the other coupled to phospholipase C activation. To identify mast cell adenosine receptor subtypes, cDNAs for the A1 and A2a adenosine receptors were obtained by screening a mouse brain cDNA library with the use of PCR-derived probes. Mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell cDNA libraries were constructed and screened with the use of A1 and A2a cDNA probes, which revealed the presence of A2a, but not A1, receptor clones. A putative A2b receptor was identified by using low stringency mast cell library screening. Northern blotting of mast cell poly(A)+ RNA with the use of receptor subtype probes labeled single mRNA bands of 2.4 kb and 1.8 kb for the A2a and A2b receptors, respectively. In situ cells. An A2a receptor-specific agonist failed to enhance mast cell mediator release, which suggests that the secretory process is modulated through the A2b and/or another receptor subtype. By using RNase protection assays, we found that mast cells that had been cultured in the presence of N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine for 24 h exhibited a decrease in both A2a and A2b receptor RNA levels. Cells that had been cultured for 1 to 2 days in the presence of dexamethasone demonstrated increased amounts of A2a receptor mRNA, but no identifiable change in A2b receptor mRNA. Mast cells possess at least two adenosine receptor subtypes that may be differentially regulated.	0
16854635	Site-specific sampling of taurine from rat brain followed by on-line sample pre-concentration, throughout in-capillary derivatization and capillary electrophoresis. A method of pinpoint-sampling followed by on-line pre-concentration of the sample, throughout in-capillary derivatization and capillary electrophoretic separation was evaluated by demonstrating the detection of taurine, 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid at a specific location of a rat brain. The direct sampling of taurine from the rat brain was accomplished by using voltage injection associated with two kinds of driving forces, electrophoretic flow and electroosmotic flow (EOF). The capillary tube (75 microm of inner diameter x 375 microm of outer diameter) of the capillary electrophoresis (CE) apparatus was already filled with a CE run buffer, viz., 40 mM phosphate-borate buffer (pH 10) containing 2mM o-phthalaldehyde (OPA)/N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as the derivatization reagent. One end of a platinum wire (0.5mm o.d.), used as the anode, and the inlet end of capillary tube (from which a 1.0 cm long polyimide coating was removed), were pricked down onto the surface of either the cerebrum or cerebellum of a rat brain at a location of very small dimension. When a low voltage (5 kV, 30s) was applied, taurine began to move from the rat brain into the capillary tube, and, simultaneously, electric focusing of taurine occurred by the action of \"the pH-junction effect\" at the inlet end of the capillary tube. After completing the injection, both the platinum wire and capillary tube were detached from the brain and dipped into the run buffer in an anode reservoir filed with the same solution as that in the capillary tube for the CE apparatus. Then, by applying a high voltage (20 kV) between the ends of the capillary tube, taurine was automatically derivatized to yield the fluorescent derivative, separated and detected with fluorescence (E(x)=340 nm, E(m)=455 nm) during migration throughout the capillary tube. The migration profiles obtained from cerebrum and cerebellum appeared to be different, but the peak corresponding to taurine was identified on both electropherograms. The efficacy of the present method including sample on-line pre-concentration prior to throughout in-capillary derivatization CE was first verified with several preliminary experiments by using samples of taurine in water, saline and a piece of 1.5% agar-gel block, as an alternate standard for the rat brain used in this study.	0
18323582	Nonhuman primate infections after organ transplantation. Nonhuman primates, primarily rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and baboons (Papio spp.), have been used extensively in research models of solid organ transplantation, mainly because the nonhuman primate (NHP) immune system closely resembles that of the human. Nonhuman primates are also frequently the model of choice for preclinical testing of new immunosuppressive strategies. But the management of post-transplant nonhuman primates is complex, because it often involves multiple immunosuppressive agents, many of which are new and have unknown effects. Additionally, the resulting immunosuppression carries a risk of infectious complications, which are challenging to diagnose. Last, because of the natural tendency of animals to hide signs of weakness, infectious complications may not be obvious until the animal becomes severely ill. For these reasons the diagnosis of infectious complications is difficult among post-transplant NHPs. Because most nonhuman primate studies in organ transplantation are quite small, there are only a few published reports concerning infections after transplantation in nonhuman primates. Based on our survey of these reports, the incidence of infection in NHP transplant models is 14%. The majority of reports suggest that many of these infections are due to reactivation of viruses endemic to the primate species, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyomavirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related infections. In this review, we address the epidemiology, pathogenesis, role of prophylaxis, clinical presentation, and treatment of infectious complications after solid organ transplantation in nonhuman primates.	0
10336184	Cyclosporin-A inhibits lipid peroxidation after spinal cord injury in rats. Besides its immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory activity, cyclosporin-A (CsA) may protect damaged tissues from lipid peroxidation (LP) by free radicals. To determine the effect of CsA on LP spinal cord (SC) injury, Wistar rats were treated with either vehicle or CsA (2.5 mg/kg per 12 h i.p.) 1, 2, 6 or 12 h after SC trauma by T8-T9 spinal cord contusion, analyzing LP 24 h after injury at the lesion site by the lipid fluorescent products formation method. CsA significantly diminished LP to levels below control values after contusion (P < 0.05). The greater inhibition was observed when CsA was given during the first 6 h after injury, furthermore, animals showed a significant clinical improvement. Results show that CsA may be beneficial to injured tissue by inhibiting the levels of LP.	0
7889263	Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition in rats with established pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic hypoxia. 1. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) causes vasorelaxation in the pulmonary vasculature. ANP levels are elevated in conditions characterized by pulmonary hypertension and it has been hypothesized that ANP may be autoregulatory in the pulmonary circulation. 2. One route of ANP metabolism in vivo is by the action of the enzyme neutral endopeptidase (NEP). We have studied the effects of the NEP inhibitor, SCH 42495, in rats with established pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic hypoxia. 3. Rats (n = 32) were divided into 4 groups. Normoxic controls were kept in air for 10 days (NC10) and all other animals were placed in a normobaric hypoxic chamber (F1 O2 10%). Chronic hypoxic controls were studied at 10 days (CHC10). After 10 days hypoxia the two remaining groups received oral treatment for a further 10 days, consisting of either SCH 42495 (30 mg kg-1, twice daily CHT20) or methyl cellulose vehicle (0.4%, twice daily, CHV20). 4. Animals were anaesthetized and blood collected for measurement of plasma ANP. Hearts were dissected and ventricles weighed and the histology of the pulmonary vasculature examined. 5. CHC10 rats had significant right ventricular hypertrophy (0.53 +/- 0.08) and pulmonary vascular remodelling (29.0 +/- 0.01%) and had gained significantly less body weight (33.2 +/- 5.5 g) than NC10 rats (0.31 +/- 0.04, 10.9 +/- 0.01%, and 59.2 +/- 11.9 g respectively). CHC10 rats had significantly elevated plasma ANP levels (58.4 +/- 9.9 pM) compared with NC10 rats (23.9 +/- 32 pM). Treatment with SCH 42495 caused a significant reduction in pulmonary vascular remodelling (25.0 +/- 0.01%) and right ventricular hypertrophy (0.52 +/- 0.09) in CHT20 rats compared with CHV20 controls (33.0 +/- 0.02% and 0.61 +/- 0.09 respectively). Pulmonary vascular remodelling was also significantly lower in CHT20 rats than CHC1O animals.6. Thus, short term inhibition of NEP causes regression of established pulmonary vascular remodelling and may be a useful therapeutic strategy in pulmonary hypertension.	0
7992349	The effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy, given by traditional birth attendants, on the prevalence of anaemia and malaria. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled community-based trial of oral iron supplementation (200 mg ferrous sulphate daily) administered to multigravid pregnant women by traditional birth attendants (TBAs) was carried out in a rural area of The Gambia. Iron supplementation led to a significant reduction in the prevalence of anaemia and of iron deficiency. Iron supplementation was not accompanied by increased susceptibility to malaria infection; there was no difference in the prevalence and severity of peripheral blood or placental malaria infection between the 2 groups of women. The birth weight of children born to women who received iron prophylaxis was increased by an average of 56 g. It is concluded that oral iron prophylaxis can be successfully delivered through TBAs integrated into a primary health care programme. This simple intervention can produce significant beneficial effects on the health of the mother without inducing increased susceptibility to malaria and has the potential for reducing perinatal mortality by increasing birth weight.	0

Starting from 1,3-dimethyl-4-imidazoline-2-selone (1), 1,2-bis(2-selenoxo-3-methyl-4-imidazolinyl-2-)ethane (3) and 1,3-dimethylimidazolidine-2-selone (4), the following six compounds, [(C(5)H(8)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+).2Br(-) (I), [(C(5)H(8)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+).2I(-) (II), [(C(5)H(8)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+).Cl(-).I(3)(-) (III) [(C(5)H(10)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+).Br(-).IBr(2)(-) (IV), [(C(5)H(7)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+).I(3)(-).(1)/(2)I(4)(-) (V) and [(C(5)H(7)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+).2I(-).CH(3)CN (VI), in which the selenium compounds are oxidized to dications bearing the uncommon -Se-Se- bridge, have been prepared, and I-V crystallographically characterized. I and III were obtained by reacting 1 with IBr and ICl respectively, while II was obtained by reduction of previously described hypervalent selenium compound of 1 (5) bearing the I-Se-I group with elemental tellurium. These three compounds contain the same [(C(5)H(8)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+) dication balanced by two bromides in I, two iodides in II, and Cl(-) and I(3)(-) in III. However, on the basis of the Se-Cl bond length of 2.778(5)   , III can also be considered as formed by the [(C(5)H(8)N(2)Se-)(2)Cl](+) cation, with I(3)(-) as counterion. Similarly to III, compound IV, which was obtained by reacting 4 with IBr, can be considered as formed by [(C(5)H(10)N(2)Se-)(2)Br](+) cations and IBr(2)(-) anions. As in II, compound V has been prepared by reduction of the hypervalent selenium compound of 3 (6) bearing two I-Se-I groups with elemental tellurium. In V, the [(C(5)H(7)N(2)Se-)(2)](2+) cation is balanced by I(3)(-) and half I(4)(2-) anions. The structural data show that all the cations are very similar, with Se-Se bond lengths ranging from 2.409(2) to 2.440(2)   . FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of I-VI allow one to identify two bands around 230 +/- 10 and 193 +/- 5 cm(-1) that are common to all compounds. These bands are generally strong in the FT-Raman and weak in the FT-IR spectra and should contain a contribution of the nu(Se-Se) stretching vibration. The spectra are also in good agreement with the structural features of the polyhalide anions present in the crystals. Crystallographic data are as follows: I is monoclinic, space group P2(1), with a = 9.849(6)   , b = 11.298(5)   , c = 7.862(6)   , beta = 106.44(2) degrees, Z = 2, and R = 0.0362; II is monoclinic, space group P2(1), with a = 8.063(6)   , b = 11.535(5)   , c = 10.280(5)   , beta = 107.13(2) degrees, Z = 2, and R = 0.0429, III is monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n, with a = 10.431(7)   , b = 18.073(5)   , c = 11.223(6)   , beta = 100.76(2) degrees, Z = 4, and R = 0.0490; IV is monoclinic, space group P2(1)/n, with a = 10.298(5)   , b = 18.428(7)   , c = 11.475(6)   , beta = 104.10(4) degrees, Z = 4, and R = 0.0300; V is triclinic, space group P_onemacr;, with a = 7.456(6)   , b = 11.988(5)   , c = 12.508(5)   , alpha = 79.32(2) degrees, beta = 85.49(2) degrees, gamma = 80.62(2) degrees, Z = 2, and R = 0.0340.	0
17177067	Long-term effects of 7-monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent antitumor agent for different types of cancer, but the cumulative, dose-related cardiotoxicity limits its clinical use. The incidence of abnormal cardiac function after treatment with DOX appears to increase with time. Therefore, late cardiotoxicity is-especially in young surviving patients-a major concern. The aim of this study was to evaluate in mice whether the semisynthetic flavonoid 7-monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) also protected against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity after a long period of follow-up. Four groups of 6 Balb/c mice were treated weekly during 6 weeks with saline, DOX alone (4 mg/kg i.v.), DOX preceded by monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.), or DOX preceded by monoHER followed by long-term weekly monoHER injections during the observation period of 6 months. Half of the mice treated with DOX only developed DOX-induced heart failure and died within 6 months of observation. Two mice co-treated with monoHER showed weight loss and shortness of breath, whereas one mouse was found dead in its cage known with weight loss. The group receiving DOX plus long-term repeated doses of monoHER started to lose weight. Five out of six mice in this group developed shortness of breath and died before the end of the study with symptoms of cardiac failure induced by DOX. Statistical comparison of the histological heart damage between the different experimental groups was not possible, because the animals died at different time-points in the observation period and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity progressed with time. Nevertheless, it was clear that the initial cardioprotective effect of monoHER was not prolonged during the half-year observation period. It was even suggested that addition of repeated doses of monoHER tended to aggravate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. It cannot be excluded that the dose and frequency of monoHER administration is crucial in obtaining an optimal antioxidant activity without a pro-oxidant activity of monoHER.	0
17587309	Hyperammonaemia alters the mechanisms by which metabotropic glutamate receptors in nucleus accumbens modulate motor function. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors by injecting (S)3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) increases motor activity by different mechanisms in control rats and in rats with chronic liver failure due to portacaval shunt. In control rats DHPG increases extracellular dopamine in NAcc and induces locomotion by activating the 'normal' circuit: NAcc-->ventral pallidum-->medial-dorsal thalamus-->prefrontal cortex, which is not activated in portacaval shunt rats. In these rats, DHPG activates an 'alternative' circuit: NAcc-->substantia nigra pars reticulata-->ventro-medial thalamus-->prefrontal cortex, which is not activated in control rats. The reasons by which liver failure leads to activation of this 'alternative' circuit remain unclear. The aim of this work was to assess whether hyperammonaemia could be responsible for the alterations found in chronic liver failure. We injected DHPG in NAcc of control or hyperammonaemic rats and analysed, by in vivo brain microdialysis, the neurochemical responses of the 'normal' and 'alternative' circuits. In hyperammonaemic rats DHPG injection in NAcc activates both the 'normal' and 'alternative' circuits. In hyperammonaemia, activation of the 'alternative' circuit and increased motor response following metabotropic glutamate receptors activation in NAcc seem due to an increase in extracellular glutamate which activates AMPA receptors.	0
9686319	Intercellular signaling by lysophosphatidate. Lysophosphatidate (LPA) is an intercellular phospholipid messenger with a wide range of biologic effects. The first discovered source of LPA in the human body were activated platelets, but several other sites of LPA generation are now known. The number of cellular interactions is also growing steadily and responses to the compound range wide, from induction of mitogenesis to neurite retraction. LPA acts via a specific G protein-coupled receptor, of which one or more subtypes may exist. Intracellularly, this receptor activates several heterotrimeric G proteins. LPA induces cell proliferation via the small GTP-binding proteins ras, and triggers actin-based cytoskeletal events through rho. This review describes the most relevant recent developments in our understanding of LPA signaling.	0
11083258	Assessment of antibodies to double-stranded DNA induced in rheumatoid arthritis patients following treatment with infliximab, a monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor alpha: findings in open-label and randomized placebo-controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving either single or multiple doses of a chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) antibody or placebo infusions, with or without methotrexate, in open-label, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: Multiple sera obtained from 156 patients before and after treatment with infliximab and from 37 patients treated with placebo infusions were tested for anti-dsDNA antibodies by 3 methods: Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence test (CLIFT), a commercial Farr assay (Ortho Diagnostics radioimmunoassay [RIA]) in which the antigen source is mammalian DNA, and a Farr assay employing 125I-labeled circular plasmid DNA (Central Laboratory of The Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service [CLB] RIA). Patients with positive findings on the CLIFT were also tested for antibodies to histones (H1-H5) and chromatin and for IgM rheumatoid factors (IgM-RFs). RESULTS: None of the RA patients had a serum sample that was positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies by the CLIFT prior to infliximab therapy. Of the 22 patients who developed a positive CLIFT result, 11 (7% of 156 exposed to infliximab) also had positive findings on the Ortho RIA at a concentration of >10 units/ml and another 8 (5%) were positive at a concentration of >25 units/ml. In all but 1 patient, the anti-dsDNA antibodies were solely of the IgM isotype. Only 1 patient had detectable anti-dsDNA antibodies by the CLB RIA. All sera containing anti-dsDNA by the CLIFT contained antibodies to chromatin, and sera from 2 patients also contained antibodies to histones. IgM-RF titers showed a significant reduction following infliximab therapy in these 22 patients. One patient developed anti-dsDNA antibodies of IgG, IgA, and IgM isotype and had positive results on both Farr assays (peaking at 22 weeks and resolving by 54 weeks); this was associated with a reversible lupus syndrome. CONCLUSION: Anti-dsDNA antibodies of IgM class are induced by infliximab therapy; the frequency is dependent on the assay method used. Only 1 of the 156 patients who were treated with infliximab developed a self-limiting clinical lupus syndrome; that patient developed high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies of IgG, IgM, and IgA class, as detected by the CLIFT and by 2 different Farr assays.	0
12846446	Enhanced insulin gene expression by reduced intracellular glutathione level in insulin secreting cells MIN6. Glutathione (GSH) participates in deoxidization and elimination of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species, and plays an important part in the antioxidant system. To investigate the effect of GSH content on insulin gene expression, we utilized a stable transfectant, designated as ribo-MIN6 cells, which were stably transfected with the ribozyme of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), exhibiting approximately 50% reduction of intracellular GSH content. We transiently transfected a luciferase expression vector driven by human preproinsulin gene promoter spanning from -1998 to +237 (pINS-1998/luc) and several deletion constructs into ribo-MIN6. Furthermore, transient transfection with ribozyme vector and pINS-1998/luc into wild-type MIN6 cells was also carried out. Luciferase activity was about 9-fold higher in ribo-MIN6 cells as compared to wild-type MIN6 cells. In the transient transfection of pINS-1998/luc with gamma-GCS ribozyme vector into wild-type MIN6 cells, the luciferase activity was increased in proportion to the added amounts of ribozyme vector. In transfection with deletion constructs, two major sites were found to be critical for insulin promoter activity. For the wild-type MIN6 cells, regions important for the promoter activity were also located at regions similar to those of ribo-MIN6 cells. Our results suggest that the suppression of intracellular GSH level might, in part, regulate the insulin gene expression.	0
9877138	Aneurysmal malformation of the vein of Galen in three patients: clinical and radiological follow-up. We studied three patients with aneurysmal malformations of the vein of Galen: all underwent embolisation followed by MRI and conventional angiography; two also underwent postembolisation magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). MRI was performed before treatment in two patients, MRA in only one, diagnosed prenatally. Two patients had normal appearances on follow-up MR studies and were completely cured by embolisation. However, the last patient, after two embolisations, despite the stabilisation of the clinical condition, underwent surgery and died. We think MRI is mandatory before endoarterial treatment, to assess the conditions of the brain. Angiography is mandatory only at the time of endovascular treatment, while MRA and MRI have a role in follow-up. Endoarterial embolisation remains the treatment of choice, and surgery is not advisable.	0
17765527	What have we learned from large drug treatment trials in COPD? Although the development of effective treatments for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been seen as a high priority, the past decade has seen a substantial increase in the number of clinical studies examining different treatments for this disease. Large studies are needed to adequately assess the effectiveness of treatment because of the chronic nature of the disease and the intermittent occurrence of some key outcomes such as exacerbations. Data from randomised controlled trials show that treatment improves exercise performance by increasing lung volume rather than changing expiratory flow. Although assessment of lung function remains the cornerstone of drug assessment, improvements in health status, the number of exacerbations and admissions to hospital are now recognised as important treatment outcomes. Randomised controlled trial data provide the best evidence for treatment efficacy, but results of these studies can be affected by differences in inclusion criteria and patient dropout during the study. Bronchodilator reversibility testing does not reliably define subgroups that will respond to a particular treatment. Carefully done and adequately powered clinical trials continue to inform, not only our views about treatment, but also our understanding of COPD and how it is best assessed and managed. Ensuring that these expensive studies are done objectively to the highest standard is an important goal for the next decade.	0
15927543	Central nervous system control of the laryngeal muscles in humans. Laryngeal muscle control may vary for different functions such as: voice for speech communication, emotional expression during laughter and cry, breathing, swallowing, and cough. This review discusses the control of the human laryngeal muscles for some of these different functions. Sensori-motor aspects of laryngeal control have been studied by eliciting various laryngeal reflexes. The role of audition in learning and monitoring ongoing voice production for speech is well known; while the role of somatosensory feedback is less well understood. Reflexive control systems involving central pattern generators may contribute to swallowing, breathing and cough with greater cortical control during volitional tasks such as voice production for speech. Volitional control is much less well understood for each of these functions and likely involves the integration of cortical and subcortical circuits. The new frontier is the study of the central control of the laryngeal musculature for voice, swallowing and breathing and how volitional and reflexive control systems may interact in humans.	0

19169376	Air-water interfacial behavior of amphiphilic peptide analogs of synthetic chloride ion transporters. A family of heptapeptide-based chloride transporters (called synthetic anion transporters, SATs) were designed to insert into phospholipid membrane bilayers and form pores. Many of these compounds have proved to be chloride selective transporters. The transporters were designed to incorporate hydrophilic heptapeptides that could serves as headgroups and hydrocarbon tails that could serve as hydrophobic membrane anchors. Insertion of the SAT molecules into a bilayer requires approach to and insertion at the aqueous-membrane surface. The studies reported here were conducted to model and understand this process by studying SAT behavior at the air-water interface. A Langmuir trough was used to obtain surface pressure-area isotherm data. These data for amphiphilic SATs were augmented by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), molecular modeling, and calculations of the hydrophobicity parameter log P. The analyses showed that the heptapeptide (hydrophilic) module of the SAT molecule rested on the water surface while the dialkyl (hydrophobic) tails oriented themselves in the air, perpendicular to the water surface. Brewster angle microscopy visually confirmed a high order of molecular organization. Results from these studies are consistent with the previously proposed mechanism of SAT membrane insertion and pore formation.	0
19740324	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced immature myeloid cells inhibit acute graft-versus-host disease lethality through an indoleamine dioxygenase-independent mechanism. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized donor graft tissue used for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation contains a large number of immature myeloid cells that suppress alloreactive donor T cells, resulting in an inhibition of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the suppressive function of immature myeloid cells is not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is related to the suppressive mechanism of G-CSF-induced immature myeloid cells (gMCs). We found that Gr-1(+) CD11b(+) cells were highly induced in G-CSF-injected donor graft tissue, which is a phenotype of immature myeloid cells, resulting in an inhibition of acute GVHD lethality by suppressing alloreactive donor T-cell expansion. IDO was not detected in primary isolated gMCs; however, this enzyme was markedly induced after treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). This level was significantly higher in IFN-gamma-treated gMCs than in bone marrow myeloid cells, which promote alloreactive T-cell responses. We next investigated the functional role of IDO in gMC-mediated inhibition of acute GVHD lethality. We found no changes in gMC-mediated survival or alloreactive donor T-cell suppression when IDO activity was blocked using 1-methyl tryptophan. In addition, there was no difference in gMC-mediated survival rates between recipients transferred with either wild-type gMCs or IDO(-/-) gMCs. Taken together, our data suggest that gMC-mediated inhibition of lethal acute GVHD is through an IDO-independent mechanism.	0
23442134	Biological treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis: indirect comparison. WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease for which there is an increasing range of treatment options. Biological agents (ustekinumab, adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept) are indicated for moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis in adults who fail to respond to, have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapies including cyclosporine, methotrexate and PUVA Unfortunately, with new drugs, the pivotal trials leading to their licensing are often placebo-controlled trials rather than comparative trials vs. established therapies. Therefore, inference on comparative effectiveness of the newer agents must be derived indirectly, through estimation of effects of the new agents vs. a common comparator. The objective of this study is to compare the relative efficacy of the biological agents through a systematic review of the indirect clinical trial evidence. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for clinical trials of biological agents in psoriasis. Pivotal, randomized, double-blind, controlled (placebo) trials using intention-to-treat analysis were selected for detailed analysis. Trials must include PASI 75 as a primary end point. The indirect comparison was performed using the method of Bucher adjusted with the ITC calculator (Indirect Treatment Comparisons of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health), etanercept being the reference drug. We defined delta value for therapeutic equivalence as a difference in the efficacy of 25% among the different treatment options. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fourteen studies (four for ustekinumab, three for adalimumab, three for infliximab and four for etanercept) were included. The indirect comparison results reveal that ustekinumab, adalimumab and infliximab were statistically superior to etanercept with an absolute risk difference for PASI 75 of 12% (95% CI  =  5  9-18%), 11% (95% CI  =  5  3-16  7%) and 24% (29  7-18  3%) respectively. However, in all situations, the 95% confidence interval does not achieve clinical relevance as no delta exceeds the previously set value (25%). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Ustekinumab, adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept can be regarded as clinical equivalents for the treatment of psoriasis. Choice between these agents therefore depends on their relative safety profiles, individual contra-indications and cost effectiveness.	0
23846535	[Impact of time of occurrence of liver metastases (synchronous vs. metachronous) on early postoperative outcome and long-term survival of colorectal cancer patients]. BACKGROUND: Today, liver resection represents the only curative treatment option for patients with resectable colorectal liver metastases. Large studies could show that liver surgery can be performed safely in specialised centres, but most of those studies did not differentiate between resection of synchronous and metachronous metastases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the time of the occurrence of colorectal liver metastases on the early postoperative course as well as the long-term survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of 30 patients each who underwent liver surgery due to synchronous or metachronous colorectal liver metastases at our centre between 2000 and 2010 were included in a matched-pairs analysis. Early postoperative course as well as long-term survival were assessed and compared between both groups. Matching criteria included: age, sex, number of metastases and size of largest metastasis. RESULTS: Postoperative morbidity for the entire study cohort was 23.3% with a mortality of 0%. No significant difference could be shown between synchronous and metachronous metastases with regard to incidence and severity of postoperative complications (20 vs. 26.7%, p   =   0.54). The median survival of the synchronous group was 38.9 months (95% CI 26.4-51.6) compared to 47.9 months (95% CI 21.4-74.4%) in the metachronous group, but no significant difference could be detected in the univariate analysis (p   =   0.425). CONCLUSION: According to the present results, liver surgery can be performed safely in a specialised centre. The time of occurrence of the metastases (synchronous vs. metachronous) does not seem to have any impact on the early postoperative course as well as on the long-term survival in patients undergoing curative resection of colorectal liver metastases. However, larger studies appear necessary to confirm the results of the present study.	0

23163390	Spinodal assisted growing dynamics of critical nucleus in polymer blends. In metastable polymer blends, nonclassical critical nucleus is not a drop of stable phase in core wrapped with a sharp interface, but a diffuse structure depending on the metastability. Thus, forming a critical nucleus does not mean the birth of a new phase. In the present work, the nonclassical growing dynamics of the critical nucleus is addressed in the metastable polymer blends by incorporating self-consistent field theory and external potential dynamics theory, which leads to an intuitionistic description for the scattering experiments. The results suggest that the growth of nonclassical critical nucleus is controlled by the spinodal-decomposition which happens in the region surrounding the nucleus. This leads to forming the shell structures around the nucleus.	0
9018452	Assessment of disease activity and its sequelae in children and adults with myositis. Validated, comprehensive measures for assessing disease activity and its irreversible sequelae, known as disease damage, have not been developed for the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), thus limiting our capacity to assess individual patients and responses to therapies. This review summarizes current approaches for assessing disease activity and damage in the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and speculates on possibly useful novel approaches for the future. Disease activity and damage indices that combine a number of these assessments are proposed for use in all therapeutic trials. Methods for assessing target organs of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies will likely evolve as more sensitive and specific measures are developed that can distinguish active inflammation from the irreversible effects of disease.	0
9562106	How drug resistance emerges as a result of poor compliance during short course chemotherapy for tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To explore mechanisms by which drug resistance might arise as a result of poor compliance during short course chemotherapy. DESIGN: Four theoretical mechanisms are first described. RESULTS: Examples of the way the mechanisms probably operate are taken from: 1) a study of once-weekly chemotherapy with streptomycin and isoniazid, and 2) the pattern of drug susceptibility in cultures from patients who relapsed after the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Good compliance is vitally important. The value of a fourth drug in the initial phase of chemotherapy in preventing resistance is questioned. An explanation for mono-resistance to rifampicin in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is suggested.	0
10640414	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of hypericin for photodynamic therapy of equine sarcoids. The therapeutic potential of the photodynamic compound, hypericin, in the treatment of equine sarcoids was evaluated. The in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed using three equine cell lines and the observed phototoxic effect was comparable to that on different highly sensitive human cell lines and significantly influenced by the energy density used although independent of the cell type. The in vivo antitumoural action of photodynamic therapy using hypericin was evaluated on three equine sarcoids in a donkey. Four intratumoural injections were given and the tumours were illuminated daily during 25 days. An 81% reduction in tumour volume was obtained at the end of therapy and 2 months later, a 90% reduction was observed. Further experimental work should be performed, but these results suggest that photodynamic therapy using hypericin has a potential for the non-invasive treatment of equine sarcoids.	0
19083258	Gaining children's perspectives: a multiple method approach to explore environmental influences on healthy eating and physical activity. In order to inform local action for health improvement, this pilot study used multiple methods to explore children's perspectives of environmental influences on their eating and physical activity. Thirty-nine children aged 9-11 years from a North London local authority took photos, drew maps, and attended focus groups. We found that the approach engaged children and that each of the methods returned useful, complementary information. The results highlighted a number of areas for local policymakers and practitioners to consider when developing work to prevent childhood obesity. We conclude that these methods of gaining children's views should be further developed and tested.	0
8109963	DESIGN: a guide to protein crystallization experiments. Existing guidelines for crystallizing proteins generally require substantial amounts of protein and scarce laboratory resources. To address this problem we have developed the program DESIGN, which, suited to daily laboratory usage, utilizes statistics when screening variables of crystallization. The program DESIGN is described in considerable detail and examples of its outcome and capabilities are shown. In addition, a new scoring scale for crystallization trials is described. It is expected that the use of such an approach may provide additional constraints toward crystallizing the protein, even if the conditions applied are not successful.	0

A broadband DFB laser array and a DFB-EAM array are realized on a single chip using four bandgaps defined by ion implantation enhanced disordering. The broadband laser array uses two bandgaps with 17 nm blue shift to compensate for gain roll-off while the integrated DFB-EAMs use the as-grown bandgap for optical gain and a 30 nm blue shifted bandgap for modulation. The multi-channel DFB array includes 13 lasers with >90 nm gain-bandwidth. The transponder includes four DFB-EAMs with 14 dB DC extinction at 4 V bias.	0
19765527	Management of type II endoleaks: preoperative versus postoperative versus expectant management. Type II endoleak is a common phenomenon after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Most type II endoleaks are innocuous and transient and therefore do not require intervention. However, particularly persistent endoleaks could lead to aneurysm enlargement and delayed aortic rupture. Decreasing the occurrence rates of type II endoleaks can be attempted with prophylactic occlusion of the inferior mesenteric, hypogastric, and lumbar arteries. Although the efficacy and clinical benefit of prophylactic occlusion of aortic branches prior to EVAR or during the endovascular repair remain controversial, we anticipate an increased use of intraoperative embolization techniques. A reasonable treatment strategy in patients with type II endoleak may be to intervene in cases of increasing aneurysm size or if the endoleak does not resolve spontaneously within 6 months. Translumbar embolization has been shown to be more effective than transarterial embolization. An alternative embolization technique is transcaval embolization, which has shown success rates comparable to translumbar embolization. Type II endoleaks can also be treated during laparoscopy or laparotomy, but these techniques are more invasive and should be used only after failure of embolization techniques.	0
19347885	The role of surgical intervention in the management of duodenal lymphoma. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The role of surgical management in duodenal lymphoma is controversial due to the rarity of this tumor subtype. A retrospective review of a provincial cancer registry was performed to assess the rationale for surgical management in duodenal lymphoma. METHODS: Patient demographics, presentations, pathologies, surgical interventions, treatment, and associated disease-specific survival were assessed and descriptively presented. RESULTS: From 1985 to 2005, 23 patients (mean age 58 years [22-82]) were diagnosed. The most common histology was large B-cell lymphoma (74%). A significant proportion presented in a complicated fashion: obstruction (30%), perforation (17%), and hemorrhage (4%). Eight patients (35%) were treated with surgery alone, eight (35%) with surgery and chemotherapy, five (22%) with chemotherapy alone, and two (9%) with supportive care. Of those treated with surgery, indications were mostly emergent conditions including obstruction (58%), perforation (33%), and hemorrhage (8%). Overall median follow-up was 14 months (1-168 months) and overall median survival was 12 months (1-168 months). There were no significant differences in survival by histology, stage, or treatment type. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy continues to represent the therapeutic mainstay for GI lymphomas. However, in duodenal lymphoma, a high proportion of patients require surgery mainly because of complicated presentations.	0
9454095	Handling and aflatoxin contamination of white maize in Costa Rica. Projects funded by International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada and the European Commission have enabled the examination of more than 3000 samples of maize collected from all regions of Costa Rica at different stages, from the growing crop through storage to final sale, and at different water contents. Contamination with Aspergillus flavus was frequent and about 80% of samples contained more than 20 ng aflatoxins g(-1) grain. Average contamination with aflatoxins in the Brunca Region was > 274 ng g(-1) while that in other regions was < 70 ng g(-1). Except in Brunca region, where it averaged 376 ng g(-1), contamination of grain from commercial sources was slightly less than of that from farms (< or = 15 ng g(-1)). It appeared that samples kept on the cob after harvest contained almost no aflatoxin while shelled samples were frequently highly contaminated. Experiments were therefore done in Brunca and Huetar Atlantic Regions, utilising 34 experimental maize crops to study in detail the development of A. flavus and aflatoxin from before harvest, through postharvest treatment before drying and through storage for six months. A. flavus was isolated more frequently from maize shelled immediately after harvest than from that kept on the cob until it could be dried, and from more samples from the Brunca Region than from the Huetar Atlantic Region. Samples harvested with > or = 18% water content often contains > 70% of grains infected with A. flavus but sometimes there were few grains infected. As found in the initial survey, more aflatoxin contamination developed in shelled maize than in that handled on the cob during the period from harvesting to drying, especially if the delay was more than 5 days, and more in Brunca than in Huetar. Shelled grain contained 400-800 ng aflatoxin g(-1) in Brunca but < 100 ng g(-1) in Huetar while grain kept on the cob contained < 30 ng g(-1), even with > 18% water content. Incidence of Fusarium spp. exceeded 50% except where A. flavus colonized more than 80% of grains.	0
8941788	General dental practitioner referral patterns for minor oral surgery. A questionnaire was sent to all general dental practitioners within Grampian region investigating the frequency of referral to hospital of medically fit patients for minor oral surgery. This was compared with their general dental practice experience and previous hospital employment. A 91.8% (n = 135) response rate was achieved. The responses indicated that practitioners refer if they believe specialist treatment is required, but less experienced practitioners were more likely to refer in the belief that general anaesthesia was necessary for treatment. A patient's request was a rare cause of referral, particularly with the more experienced practitioners. Referrals for the patient to avoid paying National Health Service (NHS) charges were rare, as were referrals due to lack of equipment. Inappropriate NHS fees for minor oral surgery treatment was a cause of referral by one third of practitioners.	0
6766427	[Modifying influence of extreme temperature on the radiation effect depending on body adaptation to heat. II. An analysis of the potential damages in a line adapted to heat]. The high temperature (33, 35, 37 and 38 degrees C) following the irradiation (X-rays, 3000r) is shown to increase the effect of radiation (on the loss of X-chromosomes) in non-adapted to high temperature Canton-S stock. This effect is due to the inhibition of repair processes and to the rising of probability of potential damage realization. The adapted to high temperature (32 degrees C) T-32 stock did not produce such effect at 33 and 35 degrees C. It seems that the heart-resistance of reparation of the enzymes of T-32 stock is higher than in non-adapted one. Temperature of 37 and 38 degrees C is effective in both stocks.	0

9619712	Randomized comparison of goserelin acetate versus mitomycin C plus goserelin acetate in previously untreated prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. In a prospective trial conducted by the Gruppo Onco Urologico Piemontese, newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with bone metastases were randomized to receive goserelin (3.6 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks) or goserelin plus mitomycin at 14 mg/m2 i.v. every 6 weeks. Treatment was planned to be continued until progression. The study was interrupted because of inadequate accrual rate when 63 patients had been recruited. A long-term follow-up (median, 47 months), performed to counterbalance the limited number of patients included, revealed no difference in time to progression and overall survival between the study treatments. However, 56.5% of assessable patients allocated to the chemotherapy arm presented a > or =90% reduction of prostate-specific antigen levels compared with 36.3% in the goserelin group, and previously elevated levels normalized in 73.9% versus 45.4%. Non-progressing patients received 5-7 cycles of mitomycin C with acceptable toxicity, but the cytotoxic treatment was interrupted early in all cases within the first year due to cumulative myelotoxicity. In conclusion, the results, although inconclusive, fail to support a clear advantage in terms of cost/benefit of chemotherapy plus hormone therapy over hormone treatment alone in advanced prostate cancer with bone involvement.	0
20804230	Outcomes of community health worker interventions. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review of the evidence on characteristics of community health workers (CHWs) and CHW interventions, outcomes of such interventions, costs and cost-effectiveness of CHW interventions, and characteristics of CHW training. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Collaboration resources, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for studies published in English from 1980 through November 2008. REVIEW METHODS: We used standard Evidence-based Practice Center methods of dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, abstractions, quality ratings, and strength of evidence grades. We resolved disagreements by consensus. RESULTS: We included 53 studies on characteristics and outcomes of CHW interventions, 6 on cost-effectiveness, and 9 on training. CHWs interacted with participants in a broad array of locations, using a spectrum of materials at varying levels of intensity. We classified 8 studies as low intensity, 18 as moderate intensity, and 27 as high intensity, based on the type and duration of interaction. Regarding outcomes, limited evidence (five studies) suggests that CHW interventions can improve participant knowledge when compared with alternative approaches such as no intervention, media, mail, or usual care plus pamphlets. We found mixed evidence for CHW effectiveness on participant behavior change (22 studies) and health outcomes (27 studies): some studies suggested that CHW interventions can result in greater improvements in participant behavior and health outcomes when compared with various alternatives, but other studies suggested that CHW interventions provide no statistically different benefits than alternatives. Low or moderate strength of evidence suggests that CHWs can increase appropriate health care utilization for some interventions (30 studies). The literature showed mixed results of effectiveness when analyzed by clinical context: CHW interventions had the greatest effectiveness relative to alternatives for some disease prevention, asthma management, cervical cancer screening, and mammography screening outcomes. CHW interventions were not significantly different from alternatives for clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, colorectal cancer screening, chronic disease management, or most maternal and child health interventions. Six studies with economic and cost information yielded insufficient data to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CHW interventions relative to other community health interventions. Limited evidence described characteristics of CHW training; no studies examined the impact of CHW training on health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: CHWs can serve as a means of improving outcomes for underserved populations for some health conditions. The effectiveness of CHWs in numerous areas requires further research that addresses the methodological limitations of prior studies and that contributes to translating research into practice.	0
11813510	From prolactin cell to prolactinoma. The pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of common pituitary neoplasms is based on the understanding of the differentiated hormone expression by specific pituitary cell types and of the central hypothalamic, peripheral and local control of their hormonal secretion (endocrine, autocrine, paracrine regulation). Tumorigenesis is the result of a complex multistep process. It is likely that a molecular genetic alteration initially leads to cell transformation. Nevertheless the transformed cell is dependent on hormonal and/or growth factor stimulation for tumor progression. This cascade is responsible for autonomic hormone secretion, and cell proliferation. PRL cells do not behave identically in terms of cell function. Functional diversity among PRL cells is documented in vitro, in terms of basal and synthetic capacity and in respect to responsiveness to dopamine and oestrogen regulation. These in vitro observations can be extended to the in vivo situation. In the intact pituitary, PRL cells differ in their relative content of PRL and their response to secretagogues. These differences relate to their topographical localization within the pituitary. Prolactinoma are mainly composed of cells with a high basal synthetic and secretory capacity and arise preferentially in the peripheral parts of the hypophysis. It is therefore tempting to postulate that the \"in situ milieu\" within the pituitary is relevant for the development of prolactinoma. By stimulating growth in certain areas, there is an increased probability of mutation. At the same time growth of a mutated PRL cell could be stimulated.	0

20507936	Narrowing down the targets: towards successful genetic engineering of drought-tolerant crops. Drought is the most important environmental stress affecting agriculture worldwide. Exploiting yield potential and maintaining yield stability of crops in water-limited environments are urgent tasks that must be undertaken in order to guarantee food supply for the increasing world population. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to identifying key regulators in plant drought response through genetic, molecular, and biochemical studies using, in most cases, the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. However, only a small portion of these regulators have been explored as potential candidate genes for their application in the improvement of drought tolerance in crops. Based on biological functions, these genes can be classified into the following three categories: (1) stress-responsive transcriptional regulation (e.g. DREB1, AREB, NF-YB); (2) post-transcriptional RNA or protein modifications such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (e.g. SnRK2, ABI1) and farnesylation (e.g. ERA1); and (3) osomoprotectant metabolism or molecular chaperones (e.g. CspB). While continuing down the path to discovery of new target genes, serious efforts are also focused on fine-tuning the expression of the known candidate genes for stress tolerance in specific temporal and spatial patterns to avoid negative effects in plant growth and development. These efforts are starting to bear fruit by showing yield improvements in several crops under a variety of water-deprivation conditions. As most such evaluations have been performed under controlled growth environments, a gap still remains between early success in the laboratory and the application of these techniques to the elite cultivars of staple crops in the field. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the identification of signaling pathways and master regulators for drought tolerance. The knowledge acquired will facilitate the genetic engineering of single or multiple targets and quantitative trait loci in key crops to create commercial-grade cultivars with high-yielding potential under both optimal and suboptimal conditions.	0
8040954	Early endarterectomy for severe carotid artery stenosis after a nondisabling stroke: results from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. PURPOSE: The timing of carotid endarterectomy (CE) after a recent nondisabling stroke remains controversial. Delaying surgery in such cases may needlessly place patients at risk for a recurrent stroke that may be major and disabling. This study examines the prognostic implications of performing early endarterectomy compared with delayed endarterectomy in patients from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. METHOD: This retrospective, subgroup analysis involved 100 surgical patients with severe (70% to 99%) angiographically defined carotid artery stenosis, who were diagnosed with a nondisabling hemispheric stroke at entry into the trial. Forty-two CEs were performed within 30 days (early group, ranging 3 to 30 days), and 58 were performed beyond 30 days (delayed group, range 33 to 117 days) after stroke. The risk of subsequent stroke after CE was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics were comparable in both the early and delayed groups. In the delayed group more lesions were identified ipsilateral to the symptomatic side on the preoperative computed tomography scans. The postoperative (30 days after endarterectomy) stroke rate was 4.8% in the early group and 5.2% in the delayed group, yielding a relative rate of 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 5.27; p = 1.00). No deaths occurred after operation in either group. At the end of 18 months, the rates of any stroke or death were 11.9% and 10.3% for the early and delayed groups, respectively, resulting in a relative rate of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.38 to 3.52; p = 1.00). No association was found between an abnormal preoperative computed tomography scan result and the subsequent risk of stroke when early operation was used. CONCLUSION: Early CE for severe carotid artery stenosis after a nondisabling ischemic stroke can be performed with rates of morbidity and mortality comparable to those who receive delayed endarterectomy. Delaying the procedure by 30 days for patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis exposes them to a risk of a recurrent stroke, which may be avoidable by earlier surgery.	0
17155266	Quantum and classical relaxation in the proton glass. The hydrogen-bond network formed from a crystalline solution of ferroelectric RbH2PO4 and antiferroelectric NH4H2PO4 demonstrates glassy behavior, with proton tunneling the dominant mechanism for relaxation at low temperature. We characterize the dielectric response over seven decades of frequency and quantitatively fit the long-time relaxation by directly measuring the local potential energy landscape via neutron Compton scattering. The collective motion of protons rearranges the hydrogen bonds in the network. By analogy with vortex tunneling in superconductors, we relate the logarithmic decay of the polarization to the quantum-mechanical action.	0

20067957	Genetic architecture of plasma adiponectin overlaps with the genetics of metabolic syndrome-related traits. OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue, is of particular interest in metabolic syndrome, because it is inversely correlated with obesity and insulin sensitivity. However, it is not known to what extent the genetics of plasma adiponectin and the genetics of obesity and insulin sensitivity are interrelated. We aimed to evaluate the heritability of plasma adiponectin and its genetic correlation with the metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome-related traits and the association between these traits and 10 ADIPOQ single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We made use of a family-based population, the Erasmus Rucphen Family study (1,258 women and 967 men). Heritability analysis was performed using a polygenic model. Genetic correlations were estimated using bivariate heritability analyses. Genetic association analysis was performed using a mixed model. RESULTS: Plasma adiponectin showed a heritability of 55.1%. Genetic correlations between plasma adiponectin HDL cholesterol and plasma insulin ranged from 15 to 24% but were not significant for fasting glucose, triglycerides, blood pressure, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and C-reactive protein. A significant association with plasma adiponectin was found for ADIPOQ variants rs17300539 and rs182052. A nominally significant association was found with plasma insulin and HOMA-IR and ADIPOQ variant rs17300539 after adjustment for plasma adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: The significant genetic correlation between plasma adiponectin and HDL cholesterol and plasma insulin should be taken into account in the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Association of ADIPOQ SNPs with plasma adiponectin was replicated, and we showed association between one ADIPOQ SNP and plasma insulin and HOMA-IR.	0

18379388	Using triggered electromyographic threshold in the intercostal muscles to evaluate the accuracy of upper thoracic pedicle screw placement (T3-T6). STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical study of high thoracic pedicle screws monitored with triggered electromyographic (EMG) testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity of recording intercostal muscle potentials to assess upper thoracic screw placement. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Triggered EMG testing from rectus muscle recordings, which are innervated from T6 to T12, has identified medially placed thoracic pedicle screws. No clinical study has correlated an identical technique with the intercostal muscle for upper pedicle screws placed in the upper thoracic spine (T3-T6). METHODS: A total of 311 high thoracic screws were placed in 50 consecutive patients. Screws were placed from T3 to T6 and were evaluated using an ascending method of stimulation until a compound muscle action potential was obtained from the intercostal muscles. Screw position was then evaluated using computed tomography and results were compared with evoked EMG threshold values. RESULTS: Fifteen screws (5%) showed penetration on postoperative computed tomography scans. Eleven screws showed medial cortical breakthrough (3.6%), 6 had stimulation thresholds <or=6 mA, and 5 had stimulation thresholds between 6 and 10 mA. Stimulation values for all breached screws decreases 60% to 65% from their mean. Four screws (1.3%) showed lateral cortical breakthrough with stimulation thresholds >20 mA. Of the 296 screws with thresholds between 6 and 20 mA, 285 (91%) were within the vertebra. No postoperative neurologic complications were noted in any of the 50 patients. CONCLUSION: In this series, cortical violation is highly unlikely in patients whose stimulation threshold lies between 6 and 20 mA with values 60% to 65% decreased from the mean (98% negative predictive value). Although verification of screw placement should not depend solely on stimulation thresholds, pedicle screw stimulation provides rapid and useful intraoperative information on screw placement during procedures involving the use of thoracic pedicle screws.	0

10501063	A ghost story: spatio-temporal response characteristics of an indirect-detection flat-panel imager. Spatial and temporal imaging characteristics of an amorphous silicon flat-panel imager (FPI) were investigated in terms relevant to the application of such devices in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and other x-ray imaging modalities, including general radiography, fluoroscopy, mammography, radiotherapy portal imaging, and nondestructive testing. Specifically, issues of image lag (including the magnitude, spatial uniformity, temporal-frequency characteristics, and dependence upon exposure and frame time) and long-term image persistence (\"ghosts\") were investigated. As part of the basic characterization of the FPI, pixel dark signal and noise (magnitude, temporal stability, and spatial uniformity) as well as radiation response (signal size, linearity, gain, and reciprocity) were also measured. Image lag was analyzed as a function of frame time and incident exposure. First-frame lag (i.e., the relative residual signal in the first frame following readout of an exposure) was approximately 2-10%, depending upon incident exposure and was spatially nonuniform to a slight degree across the FPI; second-, third-, and fourth-frame lag were approximately 0.7%, 0.4%, and 0.3%, respectively (at 25% sensor saturation). Image lag was also analyzed in terms of the temporal-frequency-dependent transfer function derived from the radiation response, allowing a quantitative description of system components contributing to lag. Finally, the contrast of objects as a function of time following an exposure was measured in order to examine long-term image persistence (\"ghosts\"). Ghosts were found to persist up to 30 min or longer, depending upon the exposure and frame time. Two means of reducing the apparent contrast of ghost images were tested: (i) rapid scanning of the FPI at maximum frame rate, and (ii) flood-field exposure of the FPI; neither was entirely satisfactory. These results pose important considerations for application of FPIs in CBCT as well as other x-ray imaging modalities. For example in CBCT, the magnitude of image lag is such that significant artifacts in tomographic reconstructions may result if strategies are not adopted either to reduce or correct the lag between successive projections (e.g., rapid scanning between projections or iterative correction algorithms, respectively). Similarly, long-term image persistence may necessitate frequent recalibration of offset corrections.	0

10883438	First observation of different diffusion coefficients for two conformers in a neat liquid. Self-diffusion coefficients were studied for the highly polar liquid N-methylformamide at pressures up to 200 MPa between the melting pressure curves and 420 K by the spin-echo method. N-Methylformamide exists as a mixture of two conformers in the neat liquid. These conformers have large differences at lower temperatures in their dynamic and structural properties. The self-diffusion coefficient of the cis-conformer being 17% lower than that of the trans-conformer at the same T and p. This is the first observation of such an effect. The experimental study is supported by Monte Carlo (MC) calculations which show that the first neighbors around a cis conformer are arranged differently than in an all trans liquid. The difference leads in the simulations to a much lower dielectric constant for the trans-cis mixture and might also explain the retardation of diffusion for the cis conformer.	0
18045789	Chromatin-associated HMG-17 is a major regulator of homeodomain transcription factor activity modulated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Homeodomain (HD) transcriptional activities are tightly regulated during embryogenesis and require protein interactions for their spatial and temporal activation. The chromatin-associated high mobility group protein (HMG-17) is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, however its role in regulating gene expression is unclear. This report reveals a unique strategy in which, HMG-17 acts as a molecular switch regulating HD transcriptional activity. The switch utilizes the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and adds to the diverse functions of beta-catenin. A high-affinity HMG-17 interaction with the PITX2 HD protein inhibits PITX2 DNA-binding activity. The HMG-17/PITX2 inactive complex is concentrated to specific nuclear regions primed for active transcription. beta-Catenin forms a ternary complex with PITX2/HMG-17 to switch it from a repressor to an activator complex. Without beta-catenin, HMG-17 can physically remove PITX2 from DNA to inhibit its transcriptional activity. The PITX2/HMG-17 regulatory complex acts independently of promoter targets and is a general mechanism for the control of HD transcriptional activity. HMG-17 is developmentally regulated and its unique role during embryogenesis is revealed by the early embryonic lethality of HMG-17 homozygous mice. This mechanism provides a new role for canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in regulating HD transcriptional activity during development using HMG-17 as a molecular switch.	0
20581008	Levels of specific glycans significantly distinguish lymph node-positive from lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. One of the most urgent requirements in breast cancer is the development of a blood-based test for early detection and prognosis. Previously published results found a significant difference between specific glycan levels in patients with advanced breast cancer and healthy controls. The aim of this investigation was to address a more clinically relevant problem, i.e., whether the measurement of specific glycans could identify women with aggressive disease at an early stage. In order to reduce potential bias in this study, blood samples from patients were collected, stored and analyzed in a similar manner. Agalactosyl biantennary glycans (FA2) and glycans containing the sialyl Lewis x epitope (A3F1G1 and A2F1G1) were measured using high throughput normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in combination with exoglycosidase digestions in sera from 52 patients with early breast cancer (21 with lymph node-negative and 20 with lymph node-positive disease) and 134 women with benign breast disease. The combined levels of the glycans were significantly higher in patients with lymph node metastases compared to women without these metastases. Lymph node status is the single most important determinant of survival in early stage breast cancer. As high levels of these glycans were associated with nodal metastases, their measurement may provide a new non-invasive approach to determining prognosis in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.	0

23007651	Biogenesis of the mitochondrial Hsp70 chaperone. Chaperones mediate protein folding and prevent deleterious protein aggregation in the cell. However, little is known about the biogenesis of chaperones themselves. In this study, we report on the biogenesis of the yeast mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70) chaperone, which is essential for the functionality of mitochondria. We show in vivo and in organello that mtHsp70 rapidly folds after its import into mitochondria, with its ATPase domain and peptide-binding domain (PBD) adopting their structures independently of each other. Importantly, folding of the ATPase domain but not of the PBD was severely affected in the absence of the Hsp70 escort protein, Hep1. We reconstituted the folding of mtHsp70, demonstrating that Hep1 and ATP/ADP were required and sufficient for its de novo folding. Our data show that Hep1 bound to a folding intermediate of mtHsp70. Binding of an adenine nucleotide triggered release of Hep1 and folding of the intermediate into native mtHsp70. Thus, Hep1 acts as a specialized chaperone mediating the de novo folding of an Hsp70 chaperone.	0

21245275	HIV-1/mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection immunology: how does HIV-1 exacerbate tuberculosis? Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have become intertwined over the past few decades in a \"syndemic\" that exacerbates the morbidity and mortality associated with each pathogen alone. The severity of the coinfection has been extensively examined in clinical studies. The extrapolation of peripheral evidence from clinical studies has increased our basic understanding of how HIV increases susceptibility to TB. These studies have resulted in multiple hypotheses of how HIV exacerbates TB pathology through the manipulation of granulomas. Granulomas can be located in many tissues, most prominently the lungs and associated lymph nodes, and are made up of multiple immune cells that can actively contain M. tuberculosis. Granuloma-based research involving both animal models and clinical studies is needed to confirm these hypotheses, which will further our understanding of this coinfection and may lead to better treatment options. This review examines the data that support each hypothesis of how HIV manipulates TB pathology while emphasizing a need for more tissue-based experiments.	0
8445995	Platelets 3H 5-HT uptake in descendants from alcoholic patients: a potential risk factor for alcohol dependence? We studied platelet 3H-serotonin uptake in 32 former alcoholics, withdrawn for from 1 month to 22 years, in their descendants (21.7 +/- 1.6 years old, n = 17; 10.9 +/- 0.7 years old; n = 19), and in respective control groups, paired in age and sex. All of the alcoholics presented high 3H-serotonin uptake (Vmax = 10.88 +/- 4.23 pmoles/10(8)pl/30 sec., vs. 0.93 +/- 0.15 pmole/10(8)pl/30 sec. Their descendants also showed high platelet serotonin uptake: 3.94 +/- 1.44 pmoles/10(8)pl/30 sec., vs. 0.93 +/- 0.15 pmoles/10(8)pl/30 sec. for adult descendants, and 5.99 +/- 2.23 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.15 pmole/10(8)pl/30 sec. for young descendants. All subjects were free of alcoholisation (biological parameters studied were blood ethanol concentration, gamma glutamyl transferase and mean corpuscular volume), and dependence of former alcoholics was evaluate by using, a posteriori, the CAGE test. In descendants, 28% of the subjects have Vmax values higher than the highest of the control group. Alcohol, in vitro, (54 mM) did not affect serotonin uptake in any group. These results indicate that in descendants of alcoholics, platelet serotonin uptake is altered, without modification of sensitivity to ethanol. The genetic basis of alcohol dependence could be linked with the platelet serotonin transport.	0
17535104	Lithium therapy improves neurological function and hippocampal dendritic arborization in a spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 mouse model. BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor and cognitive dysfunction. Caused by an expanded polyglutamine tract in ataxin 1 (ATXN1), SCA1 pathogenesis involves a multifactorial process that likely begins with misfolding of ATXN1, which has functional consequences on its interactions, leading to transcriptional dysregulation. Because lithium has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in a variety of conditions, possibly by affecting gene expression, we tested the efficacy of lithium treatment in a knock-in mouse model of SCA1 (Sca1(154Q/2Q) mice) that replicates many features of the human disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Sca1(154Q/2Q) mice and their wild-type littermates were fed either regular chow or chow that contained 0.2% lithium carbonate. Dietary lithium carbonate supplementation resulted in improvement of motor coordination, learning, and memory in Sca1(154Q/2Q) mice. Importantly, motor improvement was seen when treatment was initiated both presymptomatically and after symptom onset. Neuropathologically, lithium treatment attenuated the reduction of dendritic branching in mutant hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We also report that lithium treatment restored the levels of isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt; alternatively, Pccmt), down-regulation of which is an early marker of mutant ATXN1 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of lithium on a marker altered early in the course of SCA1 pathogenesis, coupled with its positive effect on multiple behavioral measures and hippocampal neuropathology in an authentic disease model, make it an excellent candidate treatment for human SCA1 patients.	0
7614311	Causes of hemodialysis access failure. Complications of hemodialysis access remain significant problems in the population receiving renal replacement therapy. The causes of access loss must be recognized before appropriate interventions can be designed. The native primary arteriovenous fistula is the access of choice because of its good survival characteristics and low rate of complications. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients have vasculature insufficient to create and maintain this access. Once a primary fistula is established, thrombosis is the leading cause of failure: its causes can be divided into early (less than 6 weeks) and late complications. In patients unable to have fistulas, arteriovenous conduits of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) are now the prostheses of choice. Again thrombosis is the leading cause of this access loss but there is also a substantial rate of failure from infection, pseudoaneurysms, perigraft hematomas, and simple attrition of the prosthesis. Thrombosis of ePTFE grafts is usually associated with anatomic stenosis at the venous anastomosis, within the graft itself, or in the central venous system. Graft thromboses cannot always be attributed to anatomic lesions: in these circumstances, thrombosis has been attributed to low-flow states. It is possible that the normal balance between endothelial procoagulant and anticoagulant forces are disrupted within the arteriovenous conduit. Recurrent venipuncture, hemodialysis therapy itself, or pathophysiological forces inherent in the access may all favor hemostasis. Infection also causes significant hemodialysis access morbidity. The causative organism is usually Staphylococcus aureus but several other pathogens have been reported. Ideally, all prostheses should be removed when infected, but this approach must be tempered by the reality of limited hemodialysis access sites. There is no consensus as to the best therapeutic approach to access infection.	0

19659316	Optically enhanced emission of localized excitons in InxGa1-xN films by coupling to plasmons in a gold nanoparticle. We report on strong site-selective enhancement of the emission of localized excitons in an InxGa1-xN film, induced by resonant coupling to a single plasmon confined in a gold nanoparticle. The particle was attached to an atomic-force-microscope probe and placed at the near-field distance of the surface. The observation is explained by the enhancement of the spontaneous emission recombination rate of the excitons due to the local increase in the photonic mode density near the metal particle. The interpretation is consistent with the intensity increase and lifetime shortening of the emission observed in the same film with deposited Au clusters. We show that the nanoscale roughness of the film is an important prerequisite of the efficient plasmonic enhancement.	0

8035688	Forgetting of verbatim information in discourse. In three experiments, the causes of forgetting of verbatim information in discourse were investigated. In Experiment 1, we tested the view that the surface form of a sentence decays when linguistic elements are integrated into larger discourse structures. Contrary to such a view, the results showed that when text could be integrated, both content and verbatim memory improved. In Experiment 2, we examined the possibility that task instructions could influence the level of memory for exact wording and content. The results showed that although task did influence the amount of verbatim memory, it did not affect memory for content. Experiment 3 was an investigation of the degree to which subjects would spontaneously encode surface information on the basis of the social interactiveness of the sentences. Past research has shown that verbatim memory for insults, jokes, and other personal utterances is quite good. In this experiment, identical sentences were tested in texts that had high versus low interactiveness. Verbatim memory was much higher for the same sentences in the highly interactive context. A pragmatic account of verbatim memory is given to explain how content and instructions influence the encoding of surface form.	0

17970172	[Birth after late termination of pregnancy: a neonatologist's point of view]. The bioethical dilemma of late termination of pregnancy in the Italian scenario is discussed in the light of the Italian legislation governing this issue (194/1978). The law obliges practitioners to evaluate the viability of the fetus/newborn at birth in order to decide strategies of treatment. If there is a chance of survival then the neonate could be a candidate for resuscitation and intensive care.	0
22402790	Cranial hypertrophic pachymeningitis secondary to neurocysticercosis. We report a case of a 46-year-old Brazilian woman, a farmer, who presented with recently uncontrolled epilepsy, daily headaches and ataxia. Cranial CT revealed hydrocephalus which was treated with ventricular drainage. Brain MRI revealed multiple parenchymal cysts of varying stages of neurocysticercosis. In addition, the patient presented with diffuse dural enhancement consisted with pachymeningitis, which is quite an unusual manifestation of neurocysticercosis.	0
21646715	Front end with offset-free symmetrical current source optimized for time domain impedance spectroscopy. Fast impedance measurements are often performed in time domain utilizing broad bandwidth excitation signals. Other than in frequency domain measurements harmonic distortion cannot be compensated which requires careful design of the analog front end. In order to minimize the influence of electrode polarization and noise, especially in low-frequency measurements, current injection shows several advantages compared to voltage application. Here, we show an active front end based on a voltage-controlled current source for a wide range of impedances. Using proper feedback, the majority of the parasitic capacitances are compensated. The bandwidth ranges from dc to 20 MHz for impedance magnitude below 5 k  . The output is a symmetric signal without dc-offset which is accomplished by combination of a current conveyor and a voltage inverter. An independent feedback loop compensates the offset arising from asymmetries within the circuitry. We focused especially on the stability of the current source for usage with small metal electrodes in aqueous solutions. At the monitor side two identical, high input impedance difference amplifiers convert the net current through the object and the voltage dropping across into a 50    symmetric output. The entire circuitry is optimized for step response making it suitable for fast time domain measurements.	0

17961746	Ampulla cardiomyopathy associated with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: report of 6 patients. BACKGROUND: The authors report 6 cases of aneurysmal SAH associated with ampulla cardiomyopathy, which has been considered a unique type of stunned myocaridum. CASE DESCRIPTION: All patients were female, ranged from 35 to 79 years, and their echocardiograms revealed typical cardiac wall motions: the hypokinesia in the apical area of the left ventricle associated with the hyperkinesia in the basal area. In all, the cardiac function started to recover in the first few days; however, associated pulmonary congestions delayed aneurysmal surgeries in 3 patients. Among 3 patients whose surgeries were delayed, one died due to rerupture of aneurysm and another due to severe pneumonia. The other 4 patients recovered well, although one had left ventricular mural thrombus, which was treated successively with anticoagulant. CONCLUSIONS: It is considered highly important for neurosurgeons to be familiar with this clinical entity, since this transient cardiac function disturbance can be diagnosed at the initial presentation with a unique wall motion. The significance and clinical features of ampulla cardiomyopathy are discussed.	0

10514401	Abundant production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor by adult visceral epithelia. Implications for paracrine and target-derived Neurotrophic functions. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role for the survival of visceral sensory neurons during development. However, the physiological sources and the function of BDNF in the adult viscera are poorly described. We have investigated the cellular sources and the potential role of BDNF in adult murine viscera. We found markedly different amounts of BDNF protein in different organs. Surprisingly, BDNF levels in the urinary bladder, lung, and colon were higher than those found in the brain or skin. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that BDNF mRNA was made by visceral epithelial cells, several types of smooth muscle, and neurons of the myenteric plexus. Epithelia that expressed BDNF lacked both the high- and low-affinity receptors for BDNF, trkB and p75(NTR). In contrast, both receptors were present on neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Studies with BDNF-/-mice demonstrated that epithelial and smooth muscle cells developed normally in the absence of BDNF. These data provide evidence that visceral epithelia are a major source, but not a target, of BDNF in the adult viscera. The abundance of BDNF protein in certain internal organs suggests that this neurotrophin may regulate the function of adult visceral sensory and motor neurons.	0
15621512	Carbohydrases in camel (Camelus dromedarius) pancreas. Purification and characterization of glucoamylase. The present study analyzed the existence of carbohydrases in camel pancreas compared to some other ruminants. Disaccharidases (maltase, cellobiase, lactase, trehalase and sucrase), glucoamylase and alpha-amylase were detected in pancreas of camel, sheep, cow and buffalo. Enzyme levels in sheep were lower than in the other ruminants. The highest level was detected for alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.2). Moderate activity levels were detected for glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3) and maltase (EC 3.2.1.20), while other disaccharidases showed very low activity. The results suggested that, in addition to alpha-amylase, glucoamylase and maltase may be synthesized and secreted from pancreas to the small intestine in ruminants. Camel pancreatic glucoamylase was purified and characterized. The purification procedure included glycogen precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and Sepharose 6B. The molecular mass was 58 kDa for native and denatured enzyme using gel filtration and SDS-PAGE, respectively. The enzyme had a pH optimum at 5.5 and a Km of 10 mg starch/mL with more affinity toward potato soluble starch than the other carbohydrates. Glucoamylase had a temperature optimum at 50 degrees C with heat stability up to 30 degrees C. The effect of different cations and inhibitors was examined. The camel pancreatic glucoamylase may possess an essential thiol.	0
10764806	Three-amino acid extension loop homeodomain proteins Meis2 and TGIF differentially regulate transcription. Three-amino acid extension loop (TALE) homeobox proteins are highly conserved transcription regulators. We report that two members of this family, Meis2 and TGIF, which frequently have overlapping consensus binding sites on complementary DNA strands in opposite orientations, can function competitively. For example, in the D(1A) gene, which encodes the predominant dopamine receptor in the striatum, Meis2 and TGIF bind to the activator sequence ACT (-1174 to -1154) and regulate transcription differentially in a cell type-specific manner. Among the five cloned splice variants of Meis2, isoforms Meis2a-d activate the D(1A) promoter in most cell types tested, whereas TGIF competes with Meis2 binding to DNA and represses Meis2-induced transcription activation. Consequently, Meis2 cannot activate the D(1A) promoter in a cell that has abundant TGIF expression. The Meis2 message is highly co-localized with the D(1A) message in adult striatal neurons, whereas TGIF is barely detectable in the adult brain. Our observations provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that Meis2 and TGIF differentially regulate their target genes. Thus, the delicate ratio between Meis2 and TGIF expression in a given cell type determines the cell-specific expression of the D(1A) gene. We also found that splice variant Meis2e, which has a truncated homeodomain, cannot bind to the D(1A) ACT sequence or activate transcription. However, Meis2e is an effective dominant negative regulator by blocking Meis2d-induced transcription activation. Thus, truncated homeoproteins with no DNA binding domains can have important regulatory functions.	1

15126340	HOXB13 homeodomain protein suppresses the growth of prostate cancer cells by the negative regulation of T-cell factor 4. In prostate gland, HOXB13 is highly expressed from the embryonic stages to adulthood. However, the function of HOXB13 in normal cell growth and tumorigenesis is not yet known. We investigated the role of HOXB13 and mechanism by which it functions in HOXB13-negative cells. Expression of HOXB13 was forced in HOXB13-negative PC3 prostate cancer cells using a liposome-mediated gene transfer approach. Compared with the control clones, HOXB13-expressing PC3 cells exhibited significant inhibition of in vitro and in vivo cell growth with G1 cell cycle arrest mediated by the suppression of cyclin D1 expression. Because cyclin D1 is mainly regulated by beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF), TCF-4 response element was used in a reporter gene transcription assay, demonstrating that HOXB13 significantly inhibits TCF-4-mediated transcriptional activity in both prostate and nonprostate cells. This inhibition occurred in a dose-responsive manner and was specific to TCF-4 response element. Western blot analysis demonstrated that HOXB13 down-regulates the expression of TCF-4 and its responsive genes, c-myc and cyclin D1. HOXB13 also suppressed the activity of natural c-myc promoter. This study suggests that HOXB13, a transcription factor, functions as a cell growth suppressor by negatively regulating the expression of TCF-4, which eventually provides negative signals for cell proliferation. This observation will provide valuable insight into the molecular basis of prostate tumorigenesis.	1

6775428	Nitrate respiration of Klebsiella pneumoniae on amino acids, especially on serine. Anaerobic growth on an amino acids mixture in the presence of nitrate of a strain of K. pneumoniae isolated from soil depended on the presence of serine in the mixture. This organism grew on serine as sole carbon source under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate but not in its absence. Glycylglycine could replace serine. Serine was degraded to acetate, formate, pyruvate, acetone and acetoin with formation of nitrite under these conditions. These products were practically not different from those formed from glucose. Resting cells decomposed serine also in the absence of nitrate forming butanediol and a large amount of formate in place of decreased amounts of acetate and pyruvate. These cells also anaerobically decomposed alanine to products similar to those from serine and phenylalanine to phenylacetate and formate only in the presence of nitrate. Valine was not catabolized under the same conditions. Serine was decomposed to pyruvate and ammonia in the crude extract in the presence and absence of nitrate, indicating participation of serine dehydratase in its breakdown. Phenylalanine appears to be decomposed to phenylpyruvate by transamination coupled to glutamate oxidation and then to phenylacetate and formate. Little growth on serine under anaerobic conditions in the absence of nitrate may be accounted for by the small gain of ATP in the anaerobic breakdown of serine by this organism.	0
15236274	A comparison of red blood cell thiopurine metabolites in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received oral mercaptopurine twice daily or once daily: a Pediatric Oncology Group study (now The Children's Oncology Group). INTRODUCTION: Mercaptopurine is an important antimetabolite for treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It has been prescribed to be given daily without therapeutic monitoring of drug levels. After first-pass metabolism by hepatic xanthine oxidase (XO), mercaptopurine is converted into two major intracellular metabolites, thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) and methylated mercaptopurine metabolites (including methylated thioinosine nucleotides), which are cytotoxic in vitro. Its short plasma half-life and S-phase-dependent pharmacokinetics suggest that biologically active concentration and exposure duration may be critical to cell kill. METHODS: Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 9605, a randomized, open label phase III study of standard-risk ALL, was designed to compare daily with twice-daily mercaptopurine during continuation therapy. Red blood cell (RBC) TGN and methylated mercaptopurine metabolite levels were measured as surrogates of leukemic cell levels in a randomly selected subset of patients. TGN and methylated mercaptopurine metabolites were analyzed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and reported in ng/8 x 10.8 RBC. Statistical inferences utilized multiple linear regression. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen patients received mercaptopurine 75 mg/m(2) daily and 108 received 37.5 mg/m(2)/dose twice daily. Descriptive statistics for the daily group showed the median TGN was 42 ng (mean and standard deviation [SD] = 48 +/- 35, quartiles 29-64). For the twice daily group, it was 40 ng (mean and SD = 40 +/- 27, quartiles 26-53). For methylated mercaptopurine metabolites, the daily group median was 2,020 ng (mean and SD = 2,278 +/- 1,559, quartiles 1,247-3,162); the twice daily group median was 1,275 ng (mean and SD = 1,580 +/- 1,240, quartiles 599-2,369). When adjusted for the covariables: actual dosage, days on study, age at diagnosis, white blood cell count, gender, Black race compared with not, and Hispanic compared with not, daily dosing resulted in significantly higher average methylated mercaptopurine metabolites by 668 (standard error [SE] = 179, P = 0.001) and a trend toward higher average TGNs by 6.2 (SE = 4.2, P = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Daily dosing of mercaptopurine resulted in higher mean red cell methylated mercaptopurine metabolites when compared to split (twice a day dosing). The data were inconclusive with respect to TGNs. The relationships of methylated mercaptopurine metabolites and TGNs to clinical outcomes will be elucidated as part of the maturing 9605 data.	0
21412691	Towards the synthesis of proanthocyanidins: half a century of innovation. Results emanating from the synthesis of proanthocyanidins played a crucial role in defining the constitution, regiochemistry, and absolute configuration of this complex but fascinating group of plant secondary metabolites. The initial efforts, commencing in 1966, were focused on structure elucidation of, especially, the procyanidins, profisetinidins, and prorobinetinidins. However, over the past 12 years the emphasis has shifted to the synthesis of the bioactive procyanidins and some of their derivatives at a scale that would permit assessment of their pharmacological properties. With a few exceptions, the vast majority of these synthetic protocols involve the formation of the interflavanyl bond by acid/Lewis acid activation at C-4 of a flavan-3,4-diol or its equivalent, and subsequent trapping of the incipient C-4 carbocation by the nucleophilic centers of a flavan-3-ol (catechin). This review represents the first comprehensive chronicle depicting the development of the subject of proanthocyanidin synthesis.	0
15833715	C/EBPdelta and C/EBPgamma bind the CCAAT-box in the human beta-globin promoter and modulate the activity of the CACC-box binding protein, EKLF. Developmental- and tissue-specific expression of globin genes is mediated by a few key elements within the proximal promoter of each gene. DNA-binding assays previously identified NF-Y, GATA-1, C/EBPbeta and C/EBPgamma as candidate regulators of beta-globin transcription via the CCAAT-box, a promoter element situated between CACC- and TATA-boxes. We have identified C/EBPdelta as an additional beta-globin CCAAT-box binding protein. In reporter assays, we show that C/EBPdelta can co-operate with EKLF, a CACC-box binding protein, to activate the beta-globin promoter, whereas C/EBPgamma inhibits the transcriptional activity of EKLF in this assay.	1
21077858	The social costs of academic success across ethnic groups. This study explores the longitudinal association between academic achievement and social acceptance across ethnic groups in a nationally representative sample of adolescents (N = 13,570; M(age) = 15.5 years). The effects of school context are also considered. Results show that African American and Native American adolescents experience greater social costs with academic success than Whites. Pertaining to school context, findings suggest that the differential social consequences of achievement experienced by African Americans are greatest in more highly achieving schools, but only when these schools have a smaller percentage of Black students. Students from Mexican descent also showed differential social costs with achievement in particular contexts. The implications of these findings to theory, policy, and future research are discussed.	0
11001409	Induction of monoclonal antibody with predefined ELNKWA epitope specificity by epitope vaccine. Since the hybridoma technique to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was discovered, thousands of MAbs with predefined protein specificity have been produced, and a natural or recombinant protein as antigen is necessary for inducing MAbs in the conventional hybridoma technique. To induce epitope-specific MAbs, we suggest an epitope vaccine as a new technique to induce MAbs with predefined epitope specificity. ELDKWA was identified as an important neutralizing epitope on HIV-1 gp41. The MAb 2F5, recognizing ELDKWA epitope, has shown broad neutralizing activity to many HIV strains, including primary isolates, but the mutant in ELNKWA epitope results in escape 2F5-based neutralization. To produce MAbs recognizing this mutated epitope for consideration of passive immunotherapy against the mutant bearing the ELNKWA epitope, MAbs with predefined ELNKWA epitope specificity were induced by synthetic epitope-peptide instead of a natural or recombinant gp41 bearing this epitope. Three MAbs were identified to recognize ELNKWA epitope on the synthetic epitope-peptide, and interestingly could bind the recombinant gp41 with ELDKWA epitope in an ELISA assay and immunoblotting analysis.	0
12521602	Ectopic expression of catalase in Drosophila mitochondria increases stress resistance but not longevity. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the rate of mitochondrial oxidant production governs the aging process of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Catalase, an antioxidative enzyme expressed in the cytosol and peroxisomes of Drosophila, was targetted ectopically to the mitochondrial matrix by fusion of a leader peptide derived from ornithine aminotransferase with its N-terminus. The presence of the transgene encoding this fusion protein was associated with moderate (35 +/- 13%) increases in total catalase activity in most lines, and measurable levels of catalase activity in the mitochondria (30-140 U/mg protein). There was no impact on the life span of the flies at 25 degrees C, even in an exceptional line with a 149% increase in total catalase activity, and there was a small decrease in longevity at 29 degrees C. There were no compensatory changes in the rate of metabolism or physical activity, or in the levels of other major antioxidants, suggesting that the aging process was largely unaffected. Resistance to exogenous hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, and cold stress was enhanced, but there was no appreciable effect on resistance to hyperoxia. The results demonstrate the importance of mitochondrial antioxidant levels in the resistance to oxidative stress at the organismal level, and illustrate that different effects on aging and stress resistance may ensue from a single treatment. The main inferences drawn are that: (i) levels of stress resistance may neither be a cause nor a reliable indicator of the rate of aging, and (ii) bolstering antioxidant levels in Drosophila may not delay or slow down the aging process.	0
11893339	Expression of constitutively active CREB protein facilitates the late phase of long-term potentiation by enhancing synaptic capture. Restricted and regulated expression in mice of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal CA1 neurons lowers the threshold for eliciting a persistent late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This L-LTP has unusual properties in that its induction is not dependent on transcription. Pharmacological and two-pathway experiments suggest a model in which VP16-CREB activates the transcription of CRE-driven genes and leads to a cell-wide distribution of proteins that prime the synapses for subsequent synapse-specific capture of L-LTP by a weak stimulus. Our analysis indicates that synaptic capture of CRE-driven gene products may be sufficient for consolidation of LTP and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic tagging and synapse-specific potentiation.	0
17088659	Outcome after closed functional treatment of humeral shaft fractures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the outcome after an isolated humeral shaft fracture treated primarily nonoperatively with a fracture brace. SETTING: University hospital. DESIGN: Descriptive study. Retrospective assessment of clinical and radiographic healing. Prospective assessment of functional outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). PATIENTS: Seventy-eight patients (female, n = 45), mean age 58 (range, 16-91) years with isolated humeral shaft fractures. INTERVENTION: Closed functional treatment with a fracture brace. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Fracture healing, need for revision surgery, Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA), HRQoL according to the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and patient-reported recovery. RESULTS: Ninety percent of the fractures healed after nonoperative treatment, and nearly 90% of the nonunions healed after revision surgery. There was a trend toward more frequent nonunions in simple fractures, that is, type A according to the Orthopedic Trauma Association (OTA) classification (P = 0.08). The nonunion rate in type A fractures located in the proximal and middle part of the shaft was approximately 20%. Nearly 50% of the patients reported full recovery after successful nonoperative treatment, but none of the patients with a healed nonunion did after revision surgery (P < 0.05). The SMFA scores for arm/hand function were acceptable for the patients who healed after the primary fracture-brace treatment, but the values were worse for those with a healed nonunion after revision surgery. The SF-36 scores were generally slightly lower compared with a Swedish reference population. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high overall rate of union of humeral shaft fractures and an acceptable functional outcome after successful fracture-brace treatment. However, in simple (type A) fractures, the nonunion rate seems to be higher, and patients with healed nonunions after revision surgery reported worse functional outcomes. Based on these findings, it seems reasonable to explore the use of plate fixation compared with nonoperative treatment for selected fracture types in a randomized controlled trial.	0

9536543	Characterization of circulating immune complexes in leprosy patients and their correlation with specific antibodies against Mycobacterium leprae. Circulating immune complex (CIC) levels and their antibody and antigenic composition were evaluated in patients with leprosy as well as in any individuals living with them; they were precipitated with 3.5% polyethylene glycol (PEG) and, after affinity chromatography isolation and purification, analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblot with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). The presence of CICs was demonstrated throughout the clinical and immunopathological leprosy spectrum at levels related to bacterial load, and in leprosy patients they showed a positive correlation with specific anti-PGL and anti-65 kDa antibodies. The isolation and analysis, however, failed to identify any Mycobacterium leprae antigenic components; although two specific antibodies anti-PGL-1 and anti-65 kDa were identified as possible CIC constituents and may be potentially useful in the follow-up of leprosy patients, especially to check bacterial load evolution, PGL-1 being an authentic antigen of this mycobacterium. Also, the involvement of 65 kDa in CICs, being homologous with the human heat shock protein (HSP) 60 kDa family, suggests an autoimmune mechanism in leprosy pathogenesis. Furthermore, those results support the inclusion of CIC antibody reactivity studies to enhance the sensitivity of serology.	0
16238974	Quality of life in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy. Comparison of two protocols using the EORTC questionnaires (QLQ-C30, H and N35). INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study is to assess the quality of life (QoL) of two groups of patients during treatment for locally advanced head and neck (H and N) cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two samples of 30 patients each in AJCC stages III and IV undergoing either of two chemo-radiotherapy protocols completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 general questionnaire and the QLQ-H and N35 H and N module on three occasions during the treatment and follow-up periods. We also collected clinical data. The QoL scores and their evolution over the three measurements were calculated and both protocols were compared during the treatment period. RESULTS: The QoL scores are acceptable in general. Limitations were observed in relation to toxicity, psycho-social and some functional areas during the treatment. QoL improved in the follow-up period. The clinical and QoL data are better in one of the two treatment protocols. DISCUSSION: The QoL scores indicate that the condition of the patients receiving the protocols was acceptable, considering the severity of their disease. The treatments were reasonably-well tolerated.	0
10598735	Native heart complications after heterotopic heart transplantation: insight into the potential risk of left ventricular assist device. BACKGROUND: In heterotopic heart transplantation, the donor heart is connected parallel to the recipient's diseased heart. Recipients continue to have risks, such as arrhythmia, thromboembolism, valvular heart disease, and ischemic heart disease which can develop in the native heart. It may serve as a clinical model to study long-term pathophysiologic processes in the native heart of patients with a left ventricular assist device. METHOD: We analyzed the prevalence of long-term complications related to the native heart in the heterotopic heart transplant and attempted to gain insight into the potential risk to a native heart after receiving a left ventricular assist device. RESULTS: Between December 1984 and December 1994, 16 patients (13 men, 3 women, ranging in age from 37 to 60 years) underwent heterotopic heart transplant at the University of Pittsburgh. The 1- and 5-year survival rate after the transplant was 81% and 44%, respectively. Actuarial freedom from complications related to the native heart after 1 year and 4 years was ventricular arrhythmia: 85%, 75%; ischemic disease: 85%, 64%; valvular disease: 100%, 88%; and thromboembolism: 85%, 58%. Of these complications, thromboembolism was not considered in determining actuarial freedom from complications because thromboembolism should be regarded as a device-related complication rather than as a native-heart-related complication for left ventricular assist device recipients. Consequently, actuarial freedom from all complications excluding thromboembolism was 70% after 1 year and 50% after 4 years. In addition, the hazard function curve remains constant up to 80 months after the operation without significant differences among the yearly ratios. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that cautious observation of the native heart's long-term performance is necessary for the left ventricular assist device recipient.	0
18503600	Effects of etanercept on C-reactive protein levels in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation biomarker, indicates cardiovascular risk and is elevated in psoriasis. The effect of etanercept on CRP in psoriasis has not been previously examined. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to examine the effect of etanercept on CRP levels from baseline to week 12 compared with placebo. Secondary objectives included assessment of baseline CRP and relationships between CRP and body mass index (BMI), statin drug use, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of CRP levels from patients with psoriasis who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, U.S. registrational study. Data were analysed separately if patients self-reported psoriatic arthritis. RESULTS: Baseline CRP levels were elevated in patients with psoriasis with and without psoriatic arthritis. CRP was significantly reduced in both groups after 12 weeks of etanercept treatment. Patients with psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis and patients with higher BMIs had higher median baseline CRP values and greater reduction of CRP values compared with those without psoriatic arthritis and those with lower BMIs. Etanercept lowered CRP levels in statin users and nonusers. Regression analyses revealed an association between baseline PASI score and baseline CRP independent of BMI in patients with psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, with or without psoriatic arthritis, have increased systemic inflammation demonstrated by elevated CRP levels. In psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis, skin disease activity is associated significantly with CRP elevation, independent of BMI, age and sex. Etanercept reduced CRP levels in all but the normal weight psoriasis group without psoriatic arthritis.	0

19585509	Novel HIV-1 clade B candidate vaccines designed for HLA-B*5101(+) patients protected mice against chimaeric ecotropic HIV-1 challenge. Novel candidate HIV-1 vaccines have been constructed, which are tailor-designed for HLA-B*5101(+) patients infected with HIV-1 clade B. These vaccines employ novel immunogen HIVB-B*5101 derived from consensus HIV-1 clade B Gag p17 and p24 regions coupled to two Pol-derived B*5101-restricted epitopes, which are together with a third B*5101 epitope in Gag dominant in HIV-1-infected long-term non-progressing patients. Both plasmid DNA and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors supported high expression levels of the HIVB-B*5101 immunogen in cultured cells. Heterologous DNA prime-recombinant MVA boost regimen induced efficiently HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in BALB/c mice. These vaccine-elicited T cells were multifunctional, killed efficiently target cells in vivo, and protected mice against challenge with ecotropic HIV-1/NL4-3 and ecotropic HIV-1/NDK chimaeric viruses with HIV-1 clade B or D backbones, respectively, and ecotropic murine leukemia virus gp80 envelope, and therefore did so in the absence of anti-HIV-1 gp120 antibodies. These results support further development of HIVB-B*5101 vaccines in combined heterologous-modality regimens. The use of allele-specific vaccines in humans is discussed in the context of other developments in the HIV-1 field.	0
12269577	Angle- and size-dependent characteristics of incoherent Raman and fluorescent scattering by microspheres. 2. Numerical simulation. The results of numerical simulation of inelastic scattering by microspheres with the use of a dipole model are presented. The formulas that are derived speed up the computation, thereby permitting larger-sized microspheres to be studied. The angular scattering cross section and depolarization are calculated for a wide range of size parameters as well as for different orientations of incident wave polarization. Calculations performed with small incremental changes in size permit the influence of morphology-dependent resonance (MDR) on the power and angular distribution of scattered radiation to be studied. TM and TE types of MDR produce enhanced scattering of the incident wave with vertical and horizontal polarization; the corresponding shape of the phase function becomes oscillatory. Special attention is paid to the simulation of backward scattering by water droplets, which is important for Raman lidar applications.	0
23612511	A cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between daily alcohol consumption and serum adiponectin levels among adults aged 40 years or more in a rural area of Korea. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption has been proposed to raise serum adiponectin levels, but this view is controversial. There is little information on the effect of heavy drinking. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between alcohol consumption and serum adiponectin levels in healthy Koreans. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The design of the study was cross-sectional, using data from the Korean Multi-Rural Communities Cohort Study (MRCohort), which is a part of the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES). The subjects were 1542 individuals (635 men and 907 women) aged >=  40 years who were recruited in Yangpyeong-Gun, Kyunggi province, South Korea, in 2005 and 2006. Daily alcohol consumption was calculated from average frequency of alcohol consumption and the amount of alcohol consumed per occasion using a structured questionnaire and serum adiponectin levels were measured. RESULTS: Although adiponectin levels appeared to be higher in those consuming moderate levels of alcohol than in nondrinkers, the difference was not statistically significant. Heavy drinking (>=  90.0 g/day) was significantly related to reduced serum adiponectin levels (P=0.003), although the significance of the relationship was reduced after adjusting for potential confounders (P=0.061) such as age, waist/hip ratio, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, current smoker, higher education, protein intake, vitamin C intake and vitamin E intake in men. The relation seemed to be stronger in individuals consuming alcohol in the form of takju (Korean rice wine; P=0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Heavy alcohol drinking (>=  90.0 g/day) may be related to lower serum adiponectin levels in Korean men.	0
21812331	Analgesic activity of the aqueous fraction from the ethanolic extract of Chrysanthemum indicum in mice. The aqueous fraction (AF) of an ethanolic extract from Chrysanthemum indicum was evaluated for analgesic activity in mice using chemical and thermal models of nociception. Given orally, AF at doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg produced significant inhibitions on chemical nociception induced by intraperitoneal acetic acid, subplantar formalin/capsaicin injections and on thermal nociception in the tail-flick test and in the hot plate test. In the pentobarbital sodium-induced sleeping time test and the open-field test, AF neither significantly enhanced the pentobarbital sodium-induced sleeping time nor impaired the motor performance, indicating that the observed analgesic activity was unlikely due to sedation or motor abnormality. In a measurement of core body temperature, AF did not affect temperature within 80 min. Moreover, the effective dose (600 mg/kg) also showed no toxicity within 7 days. These results suggested further that AF produced analgesic activity possibly related to the flavonoid glycosides and phenolic glycosides in this fraction.	0
22258680	Removal of C.I. Reactive Red 2 from aqueous solutions by chitin: an insight into kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics. In this study, C.I. Reactive Red 2 (RR2) was removed from aqueous solutions by chitin. Exactly how the RR2 concentration, chitin dosage, pH, and temperature affected adsorption of RR2 by chitin was then determined. After reaction for 120 min, the amount of 10 and 20 mg/L RR2 absorbed onto chitin was 5.7 and 7.5 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption percentage increased from 56 to 94% when the chitin dosage was increased from 1.5 to 2.5 g/L. Experimental results indicated that the pseudo-second-order model best represents adsorption kinetics. Adsorption of RR2 increased as the temperature increased; however, it decreased with an increased pH. Experimental results further demonstrated that the Freundlich model is superior to the Langmuir model in fitting experimental isotherms. The /\\H   and /\\S   were 16.34 kJ/mol and 152.10 J/mol K, respectively. /\\H   suggested that adsorption of RR2 onto chitin was via physisorption.	0

22826352	Emerging methods for preparing iPS cells. In 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first generated and were expected to contribute greatly to regenerative medicine. However, when medical treatments were performed using human embryonic stem cells, there were problems, such as transplant rejection, as well as bioethical issues. Induced pluripotent stem cells were generated from mouse and human fibroblasts in 2006 and 2007 by introducing four transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4). This process was defined as direct reprogramming, and induced pluripotent stem cells were better tolerated. Although induced pluripotent stem cells have contributed greatly to biomedical research and regenerative medicine, high tumorigenic potential is still a critical problem due to the introduction of the oncogene c-Myc and reprogramming with a virus vector. To address this, we reprogrammed somatic cells by transfection with microribonucleic acids to avoid using virus vectors for genomic integration into the host genome. We found that it was possible to reprogram mouse and human cells to pluripotency by direct transfection of three mature microribonucleic acids (mir-200c, -302s and -369s) with increased expression levels in embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. The microribonucleic acid-induced pluripotent stem cells have a reduced risk of mutations and tumorigenesis. Our laboratory also introduced four transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4) into cancer cells, generating induced pluripotent cancer cells that exhibited strikingly less malignant features, suggesting the possibility of a novel type of cancer therapy. However, the gene transduction method is not yet safe for clinical applications, due to a genomic integration that may cause tumor formation. We are currently investigating the reprogramming method using microribonucleic acids in cancer cells to develop a very safe, highly efficient and highly complete reprogramming for clinical applications.	0
12573807	Trophic and steroidogenic effects of water deprivation on the adrenal gland of the adult female rat. The effects of a 3-day water deprivation were studied in adult female rats in order to know what are the different zones of the adrenal gland and the hormonal factors involved in the growth and the activity of the adrenal gland. Water deprivation significantly increased plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma Angiotensin II (AII), vasopressin (AVP), epinephrine, aldosterone and corticosterone concentrations but did not modify the plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) level. Water deprivation significantly increased the absolute weight of the adrenal capsule containing the zona glomerulosa without modification of the density of cells per area unit suggesting that the growth of the adrenal capsule was due to a cell hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa. Water deprivation significantly increased the density of AII type 1 (AT(1)) receptors in the adrenal capsule but did not modify the density of AII type 2 (AT(2)) receptors in the adrenal capsule and core containing the zona fasciculata, the zona reticularis and the medulla. The treatment of dehydrated female rats with captopril, which inhibits the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in order to block the production of AII, significantly decreased the absolute weight of the adrenal capsule, plasma aldosterone and the density of AT(1) receptors in the adrenal capsule. The concentration of corticosterone in the plasma, the density of AT(2) receptors and the density of cells per unit area in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal capsule were not affected by captopril-treatment. In conclusion, these results suggest that AII seems to be the main factor involved in the stimulation of the growth and the secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal capsule containing the zona glomerulosa during water deprivation. The low level of plasma ACTH is not involved in the growth of the adrenal gland but is probably responsible for the secretion of corticosterone by the zona fasciculata.	0
18231773	Mapping and characterization of novel parthenocarpy QTLs in tomato. Parthenocarpy is the development of the fruit in absence of pollination and/or fertilization. In tomato, parthenocarpy is considered as an attractive trait to solve the problems of fruit setting under unfavorable conditions. We studied the genetics of parthenocarpy in two different lines, IL5-1 and IVT-line 1, both carrying Solanum habrochaites chromosome segments. Parthenocarpy in IL5-1 is under the control of two QTLs, one on chromosome 4 (pat4.1) and one on chromosome 5 (pat5.1). IVT-line 1 also contains two parthenocarpy QTLs, one on chromosome 4 (pat4.2) and one on chromosome 9 (pat9.1). In addition, we identified one stigma exsertion locus in IL5-1, located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (se5.1). It is likely that pat4.1, from IL5-1 and pat4.2, from IVT-line 1, both located near the centromere of chromosome 4 are allelic. By making use of the microsynteny between tomato and Arabidopsis in this genetic region, we identified ARF8 as a potential candidate gene for these two QTLs. ARF8 is known to act as an inhibitor for further carpel development in Arabidopsis, in absence of pollination/fertilization. Expression of an aberrant form of the Arabidopsis ARF8 gene, in tomato, has been found to cause parthenocarpy. This candidate gene approach may lead to the first isolation of a parthenocarpy gene in tomato and will allow further use in several crop species.	0
22856436	Percutaneous transhepatic self-expanding metal stents for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction. BACKGROUND: Malignant biliary obstruction is often inoperable at presentation and has a poor prognosis. Percutaneously placed self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) have been widely used for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction as an alternative to major bypass surgery or when endoscopic drainage is not technically feasible. The success rate, procedural complications and outcomes in patients who underwent placement of SEMS in a tertiary referral centre are presented. METHODS: All patients who had percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and SEMS for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction between May 2008 and July 2010 at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, were reviewed. A retrospective chart review was undertaken using multidisciplinary case notes of all patients. The data analysed included demographic information, diagnosis, level of biliary obstruction, number and type of procedures, efficacy and complications of SEMS insertion. Boston Scientific 69 mm by 10 mm Wallstent SEMS were used in all patients. RESULTS; Fifty patients (28 men, 22 women, mean age 61 years, range 48 - 80 years) underwent percutaneous SEMS placement. Twenty-one patients had biliary obstruction at the level of the hilum involving the hepatic duct bifurcation, 5 in the mid-common bile duct and 24 in the low common bile duct. In 20 patients (40%) SEMS were placed at the time of initial biliary drainage (one-stage procedure), while the remaining 30 patients underwent stent placement within 2 - 23 days of biliary drainage as a two-stage procedure because of difficult access through the lesion during the initial procedure. Five patients (10%) required bilateral SEMS insertion. Stent placement was successful in all patients and biliary obstruction was relieved in all. The mean serum bilirubin level decreased by a mean of 56% from 294   mol/l to 129   mol/l measured 5 days after stent insertion. Mean hospital stay after stent insertion was 4.1 days. The average length of hospital stay for patients who underwent a one-stage procedure was 3.2 days (range 1 - 11 days), and for patients who underwent a two-stage procedure 7.6 days (range 3 - 23 days). Nine patients (18%) developed a procedure-related complication, which included cholangitis after stent insertion (n=4), cholangitic liver abscesses (n=1), subphrenic liver collection (n=1), bile leakage (n=1) and cholecystitis (n=2). Three patients (6%) developed complications unrelated to SEMS insertion, which included myocardial ischaemia (n=2) and pneumonia (n=1). Stent occlusion occurred in 4 patients (8%) within a week as result of stent migration (n=3) or presumed biliary sludge (n=1); 2 (4%) stents occluded between 7 days and 1 month. Four patients (8%) died during hospital admission due to pre-existing biliary sepsis (n=3) and pneumonia (n=1). Nine patients developed duodenal obstruction due to disease progression and required endoscopic duodenal stenting. Four patients (8%) survived less than 1 month, 12 (24%) between 1 month and 3 months, 11 (22%) between 3 and 6 months, and 10 (20%) beyond 6 months. Follow-up was not possible for 9 patients (18%) from distant referral sites. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that percutaneously placed SEMS achieved satisfactory palliation with a low complication rate in a high-risk patient group with advanced malignant biliary obstruction.	0
17719303	Sodium bicarbonate, N-acetylcysteine, and saline for prevention of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy. A comparison of 3 regimens for protecting contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary procedures. A single-center prospective controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Several protective therapies have been developed to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). We aimed to investigate the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate by comparing 2 other regimens, including combination of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) plus sodium chloride and sodium chloride alone, to prevent CIN in patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 264 patients who were scheduled for cardiovascular procedures and had a baseline creatinine level >1.2 mg/dL. The patients were assigned 1 of 3 prophylactic regimens: infusion of sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, sodium chloride plus oral NAC (600 mg bid). Contrast-induced nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine level >25% or 0.5 mg/dL after 48 hours. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among groups regarding baseline demographic properties and nephropathy risk factors. The change in creatinine clearance was significantly better in the sodium bicarbonate group than other 2 groups (P = .007). The incidence of CIN was significantly lower in the sodium bicarbonate group (4.5%) compared with sodium chloride alone (13.6%, P = .036) and tended to be lower than in the combination group (12.5%, P = .059). After adjusting the Mehran nephropathy risk score, the risk of CIN significantly reduced with sodium bicarbonate compared with sodium chloride alone (adjusted risk ratio 0.29, P = .043). CONCLUSIONS: Hydration with sodium bicarbonate provides better protection against CIN than the sodium chloride infusion does alone. Combination therapy of NAC plus sodium chloride did not offer additional benefit over hydration with sodium chloride alone.	0

10893476	Effect of methotrexate on the temporomandibular joint and facial morphology in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a disease characterized by chronic inflammation in one or more joints; it affects children and adolescents up to 18 years of age. This disease may cause significant skeletal joint destruction, and the temporomandibular joint, like other joints, may become severely affected resulting in aberrant mandibular growth, abnormal dentofacial development, and/or altered orofacial muscle function. Methotrexate is the most common remittive agent used in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis to modify the course of inflammatory destruction of peripheral joints. The purpose of this study was: (1) to evaluate the effect of methotrexate therapy on the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and aberration in craniofacial development in children afflicted with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; (2) to further examine the relationship between the temporomandibular joint/cephalometric findings and rheumatologic data (ie, age at onset, duration of disease); and (3) to evaluate further pauciarticular- and polyarticular-onset disease in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and the prevalence of temporomandibular joint lesions and facial dysmorphology. The following information was obtained from 45 patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: (1) routine rheumatologic clinical examination data; (2) anamnestic temporomandibular joint evaluation data; (3) clinical temporomandibular joint examination data; (4) lateral cephalometric measurement data; (5) posteroanterior cephalometric measurement data; and (6) individually corrected axial tomographic data. The results demonstrated the following: (1) radiographic evidence of condylar degeneration was apparent in 63% of all patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with pauciarticular patients showing less temporomandibular involvement than polyarticular patients; (2) polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving methotrexate showed less severe temporomandibular joint involvement than the polyarticular patients not receiving methotrexate; (3) the craniofacial structure was affected to a greater extent in the polyarticular form of the disease; (4) the craniomandibular index scores were significantly greater in the polyarticular group; (5) vertical height asymmetry and chin deviation were noted in more than 50% of the patients; and (6) there was a correlation between the severity of condylar lesions and cephalometric findings (ie, mandibular retroposition, posterior rotation, smaller ramus and mandibular dimensions) and the onset and duration of the disease. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study, methotrexate therapy was effective in minimizing temporomandibular joint destruction and craniofacial dysmorphology in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients with the polyarticular form of the disease.	0

22195770	Dynamic expression of CEACAM7 in precursor lesions of gastric carcinoma and its prognostic value in combination with CEA. BACKGROUND: The significance of carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 7 (CEACAM7) expression in gastric carcinoma and precancerous lesions and its correlation with CEA expression has rarely been previously investigated. METHODS: CEACAM7 and CEA expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in consecutive sections of 345 subjects with gastric carcinoma and precancerous lesions. Laser confocal analysis was performed to determine CEACAM7 and CEA localization. Correlation between CEACAM7 and CEA expression with clinicopathological parameters was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: CEACAM7 expression correlated with pathologic grading (P = 0.006), Lauren's classification (P = 0.023), and CEA expression (Spearman R = 0.605, P < 0.001) in gastric carcinoma. CEACAM7 co-localized with CEA predominantly in the cytoplasmic membrane of cancerous cells. CEA expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.031). CEACAM7 and CEA expression increased progressively from precursor lesions to gastric carcinomas. A combination of CEACAM7 and CEA expression was determined to be an independent predictor for patients with gastric carcinoma by multivariate analysis (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CEACAM7 expression correlates with tumor differentiation and CEA expression in gastric carcinoma. CEACAM7 and CEA expression may synergistically promote gastric carcinogenesis. Combined CEACAM7 and CEA expression analysis can be a useful postoperative predictor for patients with gastric carcinoma.	0
7608911	Novel steroidal inhibitors of human cytochrome P45017 alpha (17 alpha-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase): potential agents for the treatment of prostatic cancer. Steroidal compounds having a 17-(3-pyridyl) substituent together with a 16,17-double bond have been synthesized, using a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of a 17-enol triflate with diethyl(3-pyridyl)borane, which are potent inhibitors of human testicular 17 alpha-hydroxylase-C17,20-lyase. The requirement for these structural features is stringent: compounds having 2-pyridyl (9), 4-pyridyl (10), or 2-pyridylmethyl (11) substituents instead of the 3-pyridyl substituent were either poor inhibitors or noninhibitory. Reduction of the 16,17-double bond to give 17 beta-pyridyl derivatives diminished potency with 3-pyridyl substitution (3-->27; IC50 for lyase, 2.9-->23 nM) but increased it with a 4-pyridyl substituent present (10-->28; IC50 1 microM-->53 nM). In contrast, a variety of substitution patterns in rings A-C of the steroid skeleton afforded inhibitors having potencies similar to those most closely related structurally to the natural substrates pregnenolone and progesterone, respectively 17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-5,16-dien-3 beta-ol (3, Kiapp < 1 nM; IC50 for lyase, 2.9 nM) and 17-(3-pyridyl)androsta-4,16-dien-3-one (15; IC50 for lyase, 2.1 nM). Thus compounds having variously aromatic ring A (18), saturated rings A/B (21, 22), and oxygenated ring C (26) exhibited IC50 values for lyase (1.8-3.0 nM) falling within a 2-fold range. The most potent compounds are candidates for development as drugs for the treatment of hormone-dependent prostatic carcinoma.	0
8935644	Clinical manifestations of transdermal scopolamine addiction. Transdermal scopolamine patches have been extensively prescribed for nonspecific dizziness and vestibular disorders. Patient response may be favorable and side effects are generally limited to xerostomia and blurred vision. However, subtle dependency and outright addiction may develop. Tapered reduction and drug elimination will suffice to eliminate the dependency. However, hospitalization may be necessary to treat severe cases of physiological chemical dependency. Long-term use of transdermal scopolamine patches carries a risk of chemical dependency. Prescribing physicians should review and heed the manufacturer's recommended use.	0
23421498	A distinct genetic population of Gongylonema pulchrum from water buffaloes in Nepal. Whole-length esophagi of 111 Murrah cross water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) were collected in the Kathmandu and Chitwan districts of Nepal from December 2009 to February 2010. Gullet worms showing a typical epithelium-dwelling character were detected in 13 of 53 (24.5%) buffaloes in Kathmandu and in 5 of 58 (8.6%) buffaloes in Chitwan. The worms' morphology and measurements were identical to those of Gongylonema pulchrum Molin, 1857, except for the length of the left spicules relative to the body length. Scanning electron microscopy did not detect any further morphological differences regarding the collected specimen from Nepal compared with G. pulchrum . The ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA), including internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2, and a partial region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of mitochondrial DNA of the worms were characterized and compared with those of G. pulchrum collected from cattle, deer, wild boars, and monkeys in Japan and from cattle in Iran. The 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rDNA nucleotide sequences of the buffalo-collected worms had 99.8% (1,779/1,782), 100% (158/158), and 98.3-98.8% (3,494-3,507/3,551) identities, respectively, with those of G. pulchrum from the other host mammals. The ITS regions exhibited higher variations between the buffalo-collected worms and G. pulchrum from the other host mammals (85-88% identity for ITS1 and 56-80% identity for ITS2). The COI also showed lower identities (89.2-90.2%), although only a single amino acid substitution was noted compared with the majority of G. pulchrum samples collected in Japan. Based on these molecular genetic characters in the rDNA and COI mitochondrial DNA, together with a shorter left spicule length relative to body length, the gullet worms isolated from buffaloes in Nepal might belong to a distinct local or buffalo-preferring population of G. pulchrum, although its geographical distribution on the continent and host specificity remain to be clarified.	0
15867032	Racial and ethnic differences in asthma diagnosis among children who wheeze. BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities exist in reported childhood asthma prevalence, but it is unclear if disparities stem from true prevalence differences or a different likelihood of receiving a diagnosis from a health professional. Concern has been raised that asthma may be underdiagnosed, particularly among minority children who have more restricted access to high-quality health care. OBJECTIVE: To examine racial/ethnic differences among currently symptomatic children in acquiring an asthma diagnosis to determine if relative underdiagnosis among minorities exists. Children for whom no symptoms were reported (a group that includes those with well-controlled symptoms) were excluded from the analysis. METHODS: The 1999 National Health Interview Survey includes a nationally representative sample of children with reported wheezing symptoms. We included children 3 to 17 years old in the study and analyzed racial/ethnic differences in asthma diagnosis, controlling for young age, gender, parental education, single-parent household, central-city residence, region of residence, health insurance, having a usual place of care, and parent-reported severity of wheezing symptoms. RESULTS: Among those reported to have wheezed in the past year (n = 946), 83% of Puerto Rican, 71% of non-Hispanic black, and 65% of Mexican children were diagnosed with asthma compared with 57% of non-Hispanic white children. Using non-Hispanic white children as the reference group, the approximate adjusted relative risk for physician diagnosis of asthma given wheezing in the past year was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04, 1.63) for Puerto Rican, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.37) for non-Hispanic black, and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.39) for Mexican children. Minority children were reported to have greater severity of wheezing symptoms. Even after accounting for this increased severity, children in racial and ethnic minority groups were as or more likely to have a reported asthma diagnosis than non-Hispanic white children. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not provide evidence for the hypothesis that symptomatic minority children are underdiagnosed with asthma compared with non-Hispanic white children. To the contrary, among currently symptomatic children, minority children were more likely to be diagnosed than non-Hispanic white children even after accounting for the higher wheezing severity among minority children.	0
21392889	Can we screen young children for their ability to provide accurate self-reports of pain? No validated screening tasks exist to distinguish children who can accurately use self-report pain measures from those who cannot. Children aged 3-7 years (n=108), each with a parent, provided data before and after day surgery. Parents rated how well they thought their child could understand the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R), and children completed 4 screening tasks in counterbalanced order, such as rating pain in vignettes and selecting a middle-sized cup. Parents and children used the FPS-R to rate the children's pain intensity. Children's FPS-R ratings were scored for accuracy based on the extent to which they conformed to expected pain trajectories (e.g., pain increasing following surgery, decreasing following analgesia), and based on parent-child agreement. On average, parents rated the youngest age at which children could understand the FPS-R as 4.4 years (95% confidence interval 4.1-4.5). The youngest children provided inaccurate high pain ratings before surgery, but they became indistinguishable from the oldest in the accuracy of their pain ratings for the remainder of the 3-day study period, suggesting that direct experience with pain or with the rating task may improve accuracy. Although children's performance on the screening tasks was significantly associated with self-report accuracy, no prediction was strong enough for clinical use (all r's < 0.30). We failed to identify a screening tool that was better than chronological age in identifying which children could accurately self-report pain using the FPS-R. Future research should explore other screening tasks, training methods, and simplified approaches to pain assessment for young children. The ability to use self-report pain scales usually develops from age 3 to 7 years, but no valid screening method exists to identify this achievement.	0
22381188	Common reversal agents/antidotes in small animal poisoning. Different antidotes counteract the effect of a toxicant in several different ways. Antidotes can reverse, decrease, or prevent action of a toxicant. They can also help in achieving stabilization of vital signs, directly or indirectly, and promote excretion of a toxicant. However, overreliance on an antidote can be unrealistic and dangerous. While expectations of rapid recovery from antidotes are usually high, in a real life situation, there are many impediments in achieving this goal. The timing of its use, availability, cost, and sometimes adverse effects from the antidote itself can influence the results and outcome of a case. The majority of toxicants do not have a specific antidote therapy indicated and patients in these cases equally benefit from supportive care. In this chapter, commonly used antidotes and reversal agents in small animals are listed in a table form. The table lists generic name along with brand name of an antidote/reversal agent whenever available, main indications for their use, and provides comments or cautions in their use as needed. After stabilizing the patient and establishing the etiology, the clinicians must review more detailed management of that particular toxicant discussed here or in other references.	0
7297480	Characterization of specific glucocorticoid receptor in the Syrian hamster testis. Cytosols of whole testicular homogenates from the Syrian golden hamster contained specific binding sites for [3H]triamcinolone acetonide that exhibited limited capacity and high affinity binding characteristic of glucocorticoid receptors in other target tissues. The receptor complex sedimented as an 8.6S binder in low salt 5-20% linear sucrose gradients and as 6.2S and 4.0S moieties in 0.15M and 0.4 M KCl, respectively. The Ka at equilibrium was 3.1-3.3 X 10(9) M-1 at 4 C in intact and adrenalectomized males. The testicular glucocorticoid binder was vulnerable to proteolytic degradation while being completely resistant to the action of RNase and DNase. In addition the binding protein exhibited the usual steroid specificities for type I glucocorticoid receptor: triamcinolone acetonide greater than dexamethasone greater than cortisol greater than corticosterone greater than progesterone greater than aldosterone greater than prednisone greater than 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone greater than diethylstilbestrol. Unexpectedly, 17 beta-estradiol competed for receptor binding to the same extent as prednisone. A 3.2 S nuclear receptor was extracted from purified testicular nuclei after incubation of whole suspensions in culture media containing 5 nm radiolabeled triamcinolone acetonide at 32 C. Although the glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in prepubertal, adrenalectomized, and hypophysectomized animals were markedly higher in the testis compared to the concentration in the normal adult hamster (52 +/- 4 fmol/mg cytosol protein), the greatest total amount of receptor per testis was found in the mature intact animal. Moreover, under the conditions studied, the concentration of glucocorticoid receptor substantially exceeded the levels of either androgen or estrogen receptor when determined simultaneously. In contrast, no measurable cytoplasmic [3H]triamcinolone acetonide binding was detected in adjacent urogenital organs such as the epididymis and seminal vesicle. It is therefore unlikely that the testicular glucocorticoid receptor is associated with the spermatid or present as a secretory product in the seminiferous tubule lumen.	0
21999550	Insights on the mechanism of amine oxidation catalyzed by D-arginine dehydrogenase through pH and kinetic isotope effects. The mechanism of amine oxidation catalyzed by D-arginine dehydrogenase (DADH) has been investigated using steady-state and rapid reaction kinetics, with pH, substrate and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIE) as mechanistic probes, and computational studies. Previous results showed that 85-90% of the flavin reduction reaction occurs in the mixing time of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer when arginine is the substrate, precluding a mechanistic investigation. Consequently, leucine, with slower kinetics, has been used here as the flavin-reducing substrate. Free energy calculations and the pH profile of the K(d) are consistent with the enzyme preferentially binding the zwitterionic form of the substrate. Isomerization of the Michaelis complex, yielding an enzyme-substrate complex competent for flavin reduction, is established due to an inverse hyperbolic dependence of k(cat)/K(m) on solvent viscosity. Amine deprotonation triggers the oxidation reaction, with cleavage of the substrate NH and CH bonds occurring in an asynchronous fashion, as suggested by the multiple deuterium KIE on the rate constant for flavin reduction (k(red)). A pK(a) of 9.6 signifies the ionization of a group that facilitates flavin reduction in the unprotonated form. The previously reported high-resolution crystal structures of the iminoarginine and iminohistidine complexes of DADH allow us to propose that Tyr(53), on a mobile loop covering the active site, may participate in substrate binding and facilitate flavin reduction.	0
20703420	Bipolar disorder associated with tuberous sclerosis: Chance association or aetiological relationship? Tuberous sclerosis is a rare disorder. Mental retardation, epilepsy, autism and hyperactivity are commonly reported neuropsychiatric disorders associated with tuberous sclerosis. Rarely, other psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, depression and anxiety associated with this condition have been reported in the literature. A case of bipolar disorder associated with tuberous sclerosis with onset of the first manic episode at the age of 7 years is reported.

Cross-section data for electron impact induced ionization of bio-molecules are important for modelling the deposition of energy within a biological medium and for gaining knowledge of electron driven processes at the molecular level. Triply differential cross sections have been measured for the electron impact ionization of the outer valence 7b(2) and 10a(1) orbitals of pyrimidine, using the (e, 2e) technique. The measurements have been performed with coplanar asymmetric kinematics, at an incident electron energy of 250 eV and ejected electron energy of 20 eV, for scattered electron angles of -5  , -10  , and -15  . The ejected electron angular range encompasses both the binary and recoil peaks in the triple differential cross section. Corresponding theoretical calculations have been performed using the molecular 3-body distorted wave model and are in reasonably good agreement with the present experiment.	0
10901440	Assessment of the acrosomal status of ram spermatozoa by RCA lectin-binding and partition in an aqueous two-phase system. The acrosome reaction is an important marker for sperm function. Because different laboratory techniques may be used to detect this exocytotic process, the objective of this study was to investigate the use of fluoresceinated lectins to assess the acrosomal status of nonpermeabilized ram spermatozoa. In addition, we used centrifugal countercurrent distribution (CCCD) in an aqueous 2-phase system to assess the sperm surface modifications associated with the acrosome reaction by observing changes in their partition behavior. We analyzed the binding of 5-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated lectins to ram sperm to select a lectin that bound preferentially to the acrosomal region, which would allow differentiation of acrosome-intact from acrosome-damaged ram spermatozoa. Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) bound intensely to the anterior and weakly to the equatorial acrosomal regions. Acrosomal labeling changed when spermatozoa were induced to acrosome-react with calcium ionophore A23187. RCA acrosomal labeling significantly increased (P < .0001) after incubation (84% versus 28% in control samples). To determine if RCA lectin labeling could be used to assess the acrosomal status of fresh ram spermatozoa in suspension, we compared the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm detected by the carboxyfluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide (CFDA/PI) double-fluorescent staining with the percentage detected by FITC-RCA labeling. The incidence of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa detected by CFDA/PI was not significantly different (P = .704; 13 comparisons in 6 different experiments) from the incidence of spermatozoa detected by FITC-RCA staining. The evaluation of the spontaneous acrosome reaction by RCA labeling (5.83%) was not significantly different (P = .644) from that assessed by CFDA/PI (6.88%). The percentage of induced acrosome reactions detected by CFDA/PI staining (56%) significantly correlated (P < .0001; r = 0.876) with that detected by RCA labeling (56.67%). We simultaneously carried out a comparative CCCD in an aqueous 2-phase system to analyze sperm surface changes associated with the acrosome reaction. Results revealed that sperm surface hydrophobicity decreased in samples that had been incubated with ionophore compared with the untreated-control samples. Likewise, RCA binding after CCCD showed that all acrosome-reacted cells were stained, whereas only 42% of cells were lectin-labeled in the untreated semen sample. This change in lectin reactivity of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa signals the presence of some deep membrane or intracellular residues that would affect partitioning. Therefore, the FITC-RCA-labeling procedure can be used to accurately assess the acrosomal status of ram spermatozoa in suspension.	0
17419892	Consumption of fish and risk of colon cancer in the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study. Recent studies have shown a decreased risk of colon cancer with consumption of fish. However, most studies on fish consumption do not distinguish between lean and fatty fish, or between poached and fried fish. The aim of this study was to investigate any association between fish consumption and colon cancer in The Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) study. We focused mainly on lean fish, which was further divided into poached and fried fish. A total of 63 914 women were included in the analysis, 254 of whom were found to have colon cancer during follow-up. Since fish consumption was one of the main topics of interest in the NOWAC study, there is a predominance of women from northern Norway due to higher fish intake in this area; hence the study is not representative of the whole of Norway. The participants completed a semi-quantitative FFQ between 1996 and 1999, and were followed-up for incidence of colon cancer until 2004. No association between fish consumption and risk of colon cancer was seen, except for the third tertile of poached lean fish consumption (relative risk (RR) 1.46, 95 % CI 1.04, 2.06). This association disappeared when excluding women with less than 1 year of follow-up. In conclusion, the present study does not support the hypothesis of a protective effect of fish against colon cancer risk.	0
7553105	Symmetry of outcome after photorefractive keratectomy for myopia. The aim of this study was to find out whether the outcome of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in the second eye can be predicted from the results of the first, and to determine whether we should modify our therapeutic approach to the second eye according to the results of the first. Bilateral PRK was performed in 73 patients using the Summit Technology excimer laser. All patients included in this study had a follow-up of at least 12 months in both eyes. The change of refraction and the haze of the two eyes were compared. Sixty percent of patients had a difference in refraction between the two eyes smaller than 0.50 diopters (D), and 75% had a difference smaller than 1.00 D. The degree of symmetry in response to treatment was greater in patients with a preoperative spherical equivalent refraction of less than -6.00 D. Most patients had a similar degree of haze in both eyes. The results of our study demonstrate that a considerable degree of symmetry in the outcome of surgery exists between the two eyes of the same patient undergoing PRK, especially in low to moderate myopia.	0

16564806	Inter-eye comparison of patterns of visual field loss in patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. PURPOSE: To compare inter-eye patterns of visual field (VF) loss on standard automated perimetry (SAP) in patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. METHODS: Four-hundred-and-ninety eyes of 245 patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy in at least one eye defined by masked stereophoto review were included. Patients had two reliable SAP visual fields within fifteen months for each eye. Patterns of visual field loss were classified independently by two graders masked to all other patient information. Patterns were described as altitudinal, arcuate, partial arcuate, paracentral, nasal step, temporal wedge, or normal based on the classification system of Keltner and associates. Superior and inferior hemifields were graded separately. RESULTS: Inter-grader agreement in visual field patterns before adjudication was 97% and 94% for the worse eye (superior and inferior hemifield) and 97% and 95% for the better eye (superior and inferior hemifield). The percentage of correspondence by hemifield location was: 53% (superior-superior), 62% (inferior-inferior), 45% (superior-inferior), and 55% (inferior-superior). The highest correspondence of individual glaucomatous VF pattern between eyes was for arcuate (superior-superior) and inferior partial arcuate (inferior-inferior) defects (24% and 26%, respectively). Smaller hemifield patterns showed lower correspondence between the eyes (nasal step, paracentral, temporal wedge, 0% to 13% correspondence). CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of visual field loss between eyes often corresponded within the same VF hemifield (superior-superior, inferior-inferior) as well as between opposite hemifields (inferior-superior), although opposite hemifield correspondence was less common. More advanced visual field defects (for example, partial arcuate) showed higher correspondence rates between the eyes than less advanced defects.	0
15572416	Comparison of hormone levels in nipple aspirate fluid of pre- and postmenopausal women: effect of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement. The effects of ovarian suppression by oral contraceptives as well as hormone replacement therapy were studied on hormone levels and on products of hormone action in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) from breasts of pre- and postmenopausal women. Multiple samples per subject revealed high consistency (intraclass correlation coefficients) for all products measured. Compared with premenopausal women, NAF progesterone was much lower in postmenopausal women, but NAF androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations were not different. With oral contraceptive use, estradiol, estrone sulfate, and progesterone levels were similarly lower in serum and NAF. In postmenopausal women, NAF estradiol and estrone sulfate were not significantly less than those in premenopausal women, nor were epidermal growth factor or cathepsin D levels, but IL-6 was elevated. Despite corresponding changes in hormones in serum and NAF over time, correlations based on simultaneous sampling were not significant. It is concluded that: 1) potential precursors of estradiol remain at comparable levels in the breast after menopause; 2) local synthesis is important for maintenance of estradiol levels in NAF of postmenopausal women but less important for progesterone; and 3) changes in the serum parameters are accurately reflected in NAF, but only after a matter of days. These findings provide additional validation for the physiological relevance of NAF hormone levels as potential breast cancer risk markers.	0
9747525	A decrement-to-familiarity interpretation of the revelation effect from forced-choice tests of recognition memory. In the revelation effect, the probability of labeling a target or a lure as \"old\" on item recognition tests increases if just prior to their recognition judgment, participants first identify a disguised version of the test item. The same occurs with interpolated tasks that occur just prior to a recognition judgment if the task shares constituents with the test items. One explanation of this test bias is an increased feeling of familiarity that comes from the identification stage preceding the recognition judgment (e.g., D. C. LeCompte, 1995; C. R. Lou, 1993). This study's finding in 4 experiments that 2-alternative forced-choice recognition either yields no effects of revelation or an \"antirevelation\" effect, even when both items were studied or nonstudied, is incongruent with this explanation. The authors argue that revelation decrements familiarity, and this results in a more liberal criterion shift. They also argue that their theory is more consistent with previous empirical data.	0
21217782	LITAF and TNFSF15, two downstream targets of AMPK, exert inhibitory effects on tumor growth. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a factor (LITAF) is a multiple functional molecule whose sequence is identical to the small integral membrane protein of the lysosome/late endosome. LITAF was initially identified as a transcription factor that activates transcription of proinflammatory cytokine in macrophages in response to LPS. Mutations of the LITAF gene are associated with a genetic disease, called Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. Recently, we have reported that mRNA levels of LITAF and TNF superfamily member 15 (TNFSF15) are upregulated by 5' adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The present study further assesses their biological functions. Thus, we show that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), a pharmacological activator of AMPK, increases the abundance of LITAF and TNFSF15 in LNCaP and C4-2 prostate cancer cells, which is abrogated by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or the dominant-negative mutant of AMPK a1 subunit. Our data further demonstrate that AMPK activation upregulates the transcription of LITAF. Intriguingly, silencing LITAF by shRNA enhances proliferation, anchorage-independent growth of these cancer cells and tumor growth in the xenograft model. In addition, our study reveals that LITAF mediates the effect of AMPK by binding to a specific sequence in the promoter region. Furthermore, we show that TNFSF15 remarkably inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells in vitro, with a more potent effect toward the latter. In conjuncture, intratumoral injection of TNFSF15 significantly reduces the size of tumors and number of blood vessels and induces changes that are characteristic of tumor cell differentiation. Therefore, our studies for the first time establish the regulatory axis of AMPK-LITAF-TNFSF15 and also suggest that LITAF may function as a tumor suppressor.	1
16996850	The impact of the AMPD1 gene polymorphism on exercise capacity, other prognostic parameters, and survival in patients with stable congestive heart failure: a study in 686 consecutive patients. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that the adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 (AMPD1) C34T polymorphism may be associated with survival in cardiac populations with a protective effect of the T allele. However, these studies included limited number of patients with few cardiovascular events. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the impact of the C34T polymorphism of the AMPD1 gene in 686 unrelated white patients with stable congestive heart failure related to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Patients underwent echocardiography, radionuclide angiography, and a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Blood samples were drawn for standard and hormonal determinations and for genetic analysis. RESULTS: There were 517 (75%) CC homozygotes, 155 (23%) CT heterozygotes, and 14 (2%) TT mutated homozygotes. We did not demonstrate any impact of this polymorphism on clinical, biologic, echocardiographic, radionuclide, and exercise parameters in the whole population and in ischemic and nonischemic subgroups of patients. During a median follow-up period of 3 years, there were 145 cardiac-related deaths and 6 urgent transplantations. There was no impact of this polymorphism on survival. CONCLUSIONS: In our population, we did not demonstrate any effect of the C34T polymorphism of the AMPD1 gene on major congestive heart failure parameters and on survival.	0
16111161	Temporal folate status during lactation in mares and growth in foals. OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in folate status of mares and foals during lactation and growth, respectively. ANIMALS: 20 Thoroughbred mares and foals. PROCEDURES: Pregnant mares, and following foaling the same mares with their foals, were maintained on mixed grass-legume pasture and fed either a traditional dietary supplement rich in sugar and starch (SS) or a dietary supplement high in fat and fiber (FF). Blood samples were collected monthly from mares and foals up to 6 months after foaling. Total folate concentration in feed and forage was determined. Analyses of plasma folate, RBC folate, plasma homocysteine (HCY), and milk folate concentrations were performed. RESULTS: Mare plasma folate concentrations declined moderately during 6 months of lactation. Mare RBC folate concentrations initially increased after foaling up to 3 months but declined toward the end of the study. Plasma HCY concentration was higher for mares fed the SS supplement, compared with mares fed the FF supplement from foaling to 6 months of lactation. Milk folate concentrations decreased during the first 3 months and then increased. Foal plasma folate initially declined but then increased. Stable concentrations of RBC folate were observed in foals. Plasma HCY concentrations in foals were unaffected by growth during the last 5 months. References range values for plasma folate, RBC folate, milk folate, and plasma HCY concentrations in healthy lactational mares and young growing foals were determined. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Folate status was not impaired in lactating mares and growing foals under the conditions in our study. It appears that folate supplementation is not necessary.	0
22100360	Anatomy and physiology of cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is contained in the brain ventricles and the cranial and spinal subarachnoid spaces. The mean CSF volume is 150 ml, with 25 ml in the ventricles and 125 ml in subarachnoid spaces. CSF is predominantly, but not exclusively, secreted by the choroid plexuses. Brain interstitial fluid, ependyma and capillaries may also play a poorly defined role in CSF secretion. CSF circulation from sites of secretion to sites of absorption largely depends on the arterial pulse wave. Additional factors such as respiratory waves, the subject's posture, jugular venous pressure and physical effort also modulate CSF flow dynamics and pressure. Cranial and spinal arachnoid villi have been considered for a long time to be the predominant sites of CSF absorption into the venous outflow system. Experimental data suggest that cranial and spinal nerve sheaths, the cribriform plate and the adventitia of cerebral arteries constitute substantial pathways of CSF drainage into the lymphatic outflow system. CSF is renewed about four times every 24 hours. Reduction of the CSF turnover rate during ageing leads to accumulation of catabolites in the brain and CSF that are also observed in certain neurodegenerative diseases. The CSF space is a dynamic pressure system. CSF pressure determines intracranial pressure with physiological values ranging between 3 and 4 mmHg before the age of one year, and between 10 and 15 mmHg in adults. Apart from its function of hydromechanical protection of the central nervous system, CSF also plays a prominent role in brain development and regulation of brain interstitial fluid homeostasis, which influences neuronal functioning.	0
24166967	Mystery case: a young boy with myoclonic jerks. A 16-year-old right-handed boy presented for consultation for recent development of seizures. He is the product of a normal pregnancy and delivery without a history of developmental delay, head trauma, or family history of epilepsy. A year and a half prior to our consultation, the patient noted that his hand would suddenly jerk across the page while writing in his morning classes. Stress would exacerbate the jerks. Six months later, after staying up late the previous night, the patient awoke early and began to play on the computer when both of his hands suddenly jerked multiple times. He then fell over and began seizing. His mother witnessed tonic contraction of his body followed by clonic activity. He was brought by ambulance to the nearest hospital where a CT head was reported normal.	0
11407291	Rapid recovery of spontaneous baroreflex after sevoflurane anesthesia in ambulatory surgery. BACKGROUND: Although sevoflurane seems to have fulfilled the criteria of ideal anesthetic agent for ambulatory surgery, its effects on intraoperative alteration and postoperative recovery of arterial baroreflex have not been well documented. This study assessed the time required for patients anesthetized with sevoflurane to regain their baseline baroreflex after ambulatory surgeries. METHODS: Ten ASA class I female patients scheduled for minor gynecological operation (D_C) were enrolled in this study. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (SBR) calculated by sequence analysis of beat-to-beat variations in systolic arterial pressure and R-R intervals was recorded before anesthesia (Baseline), during anesthesia (Anesthesia), five min after operation (Post-op 1) and ten min after operation (Post-op 2). Data obtained from Anesthesia, Post-op 1, and Post-op 2 was compared with the Baseline. RESULTS: SBR value determined in Baseline group (28.6 +/- 4.9 ms/mmHg) was significantly different from Anesthesia group (12.2 +/- 2.1 ms/mmHg) and Post-op 1 group (15.8 +/- 1.8 ms/mmHg). Patients regained their conscious baseline baroreflex sensitivity within ten min after sevoflurane was switched off. CONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane anesthesia depresses SBR and provides a quick SBR recovery upon emergence.	0

21212871	Dynamics of intermediate filament assembly followed in micro-flow by small angle X-ray scattering. The assembly of intermediate filaments (IFs) is a complex process that can be recapitulated through a series of distinct steps in vitro. The combination of microfluidics and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provides a powerful tool to investigate the kinetics of this process on the relevant timescales. Microfluidic mixers based on the principle of hydrodynamic focusing allow for precise control of the mixing of proteins and smaller reagents like ions. Here, we present a multi-layer device that prevents proteins from adsorbing to the channel walls by engulfing the protein jet with a fluid layer of buffer. To ensure compatibility with SAXS, the device is fabricated from UV-curable adhesive (NOA 81). To demonstrate the successful prevention of contact between the protein jet and the channel walls we measure the distribution of a fluorescent dye in the device by confocal microscopy at various flow speeds and compare the results to finite element method (FEM) simulations. The prevention of contact enables the investigation of the assembly of IFs in flow by gradually increasing the salt concentration in the protein jet. The diffusion of salt into the jet can be determined by FEM simulations. SAXS data are collected at different positions in the jet, corresponding to different salt concentrations, and they reveal distinct differences between the earliest assembly states. We find that the mean square radius of gyration perpendicular to the filament axis increases from 13 nm(2) to 58 nm(2) upon assembly. Thereby we provide dynamic structural data of a complex assembly process that was amenable up to now only by microscopic techniques.	0

22440594	Tongue entrapment in aluminum water bottle: discussion of removal and airway management. Tongue entrapment in a bottle neck is rare, with few cases reported in the literature. Reported here is the case of a child who presented to the Emergency Department with her tongue entrapped in an aluminum bottle. This case is unique in that the patient had a delayed presentation resulting in significant tongue edema, requiring advanced methods for removal and airway management. These include sedated mechanical removal of the strangulating object and transnasal fiberoptic intubation. We review published cases and the options for removal of an entrapped tongue from a bottle neck, and we discuss the importance of airway management.	0
16442394	Clinical and angiographic analysis with a cobalt alloy coronary stent (driver) in stable and unstable angina pectoris. The Clinical and Angiographic analysis with a Cobalt Alloy Coronary Stent (Driver) (CLASS) study was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a cobalt-chromium alloy-based stent in patients with stable or unstable angina pectoris. A total of 203 lesions were treated in 202 enrolled patients. The percentage of major adverse cardiac event-free patients was 87.6% (177 of 202) at 6 months (primary safety end point; major adverse cardiac events were defined as death, myocardial infarction, emergency bypass surgery, or target lesion revascularization [percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting]). The angiographic success rate (primary efficacy end point) was 100%, and the procedural success rate was 98%. The binary in-stent restenosis rate at 6 months was 12.6%. Our results have demonstrated that the Driver cobalt-chromium alloy stent can be used with a low 6-month incidence of major adverse cardiac events, a low 6-month binary restenosis rate, and high angiographic and procedural success rates.	0
10780828	Alcohol and the appetizer effect. In order to evaluate the effects of alcohol on appetite, 12 unrestrained and 10 restrained men ate lunch 20 min after consuming preloads consisting of water, an alcoholic fruit juice (alcohol) and a non-alcoholic fruit juice (juice). The unrestrained men ate significantly less after the juice preload, and ate most after alcohol. Intake was not altered significantly in the restrained men. However, both the alcohol and juice preloads reduced rated hunger and increased fullness, relative to the water control, in both restrained and unrestrained men. When the relationship between rated appetite and intake within the test meal was modelled mathematically, it was found that hunger increased more during the initial stages of the test meal in the unrestrained men who had consumed alcohol than in any other condition. No such effects were seen in the restrained subjects. Overall, these results suggest that alcohol has a complex action on appetite, which includes some form of appetite stimulation, and this may explain the excess energy intake reported previously in moderate alcohol consumers.	0

18820740	Hookworm-related anaemia among pregnant women: a systematic review. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hookworm infection is among the major causes of anaemia in poor communities, but its importance in causing maternal anaemia is poorly understood, and this has hampered effective lobbying for the inclusion of anthelmintic treatment in maternal health packages. We sought to review existing evidence on the role of hookworm as a risk factor for anaemia among pregnant women. We also estimate the number of hookworm infections in pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). METHODS: Structured searches using MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as manual searches of reference lists were conducted, and unpublished data were obtained by contacting authors. Papers were independently reviewed by two authors, and relevant data were extracted. We compared haemoglobin concentration (Hb) according to intensity of hookworm infection and calculated standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. To estimate the number of pregnant women, we used population surfaces and a spatial model of hookworm prevalence. FINDINGS: One hundred and five reports were screened and 19 were eligible for inclusion: 13 cross-sectional studies, 2 randomised controlled trials, 2 non-randomised treatment trials and 2 observational studies. Comparing uninfected women and women lightly (1-1,999 eggs/gram [epg]) infected with hookworm, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was -0.24 (95% CI: -0.36 to -0.13). The SMD between women heavily (4000+ epg) infected and those lightly infected was -0.57 (95% CI: -0.87 to -0.26). All identified intervention studies showed a benefit of deworming for maternal or child health, but since a variety of outcomes measures were employed, quantitative evaluation was not possible. We estimate that 37.7 million women of reproductive age in SSA are infected with hookworm in 2005 and that approximately 6.9 million pregnant women are infected. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that increasing hookworm infection intensity is associated with lower haemoglobin levels in pregnant women in poor countries. There are insufficient data to quantify the benefits of deworming, and further studies are warranted. Given that between a quarter and a third of pregnant women in SSA are infected with hookworm and at risk of preventable hookworm-related anaemia, efforts should be made to increase the coverage of anthelmintic treatment among pregnant women.	0

8703420	Changes in surface topography in endothelial monolayers with time at confluence: influence on subcellular shear stress distribution due to flow. It is well known that the morphology of endothelial cells in culture changes dramatically as they go from subconfluence to confluence. After reaching confluence, however, the morphology continues to change but much more subtly as cell density increases and they become more uniform in size and shape. Measurements of surface topography of confluent cells by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that cell heights became more uniform and that the root-mean-square amplitude of surface undulations decreased by 7% compared with monolayers that had just reached confluence. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of flow over the endothelial surface geometries measured by AFM showed that the change in topography with time after confluence altered the shear stress distribution, resulting in an increase in the stress concentrations experienced by the cells despite the reduced amplitude of the surface undulation. These data suggest that the starting point for in vitro experiments may influence the measured responses to shear stress, particularly transient responses that occur before structural adaptation takes place. In addition, changes in surface topography may reflect changes in cell tension, cytoskeletal structure, and adhesion to the substratum, all of which are associated with the regulation of growth in anchorage-dependent cells.	0
12827633	Assignment of acetyl groups to O-2 and/or O-3 of pectic oligogalacturonides using negative electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry. Partially acetylated and methylated oligogalacturonides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of sugar beet pectin were analysed by negative electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-ITMS). The (18)O labelling of the oligomer reducing end allowed the precise assignment of the fragments resulting from glycosidic bond and cross-ring cleavages. The collisional-induced dissociation of the C(i) and Z(j) fragment ions through sequential MS(n) experiments always displayed (0, 2)A-type cross-ring cleavage ions which were related to C(2)H(4)O(2) losses. These (0, 2)A ions appeared to be highly diagnostic ions allowing the precise location of the acetyl groups to the O-2 and/or O-3 of the acetylated galacturonic acid residues.	0
8728623	Dry eye: pharmacological approaches, effects, and progress. PURPOSE: The effects of available pharmaceuticals on the tear film and ocular surface in dry eye are reviewed and the progress that has been made in dry eye treatment is discussed. METHODS: Pharmaceuticals are examined with regard to their effect on physical and morphological events or milestones in the natural history of dry eye disease. RESULTS: Dry eye disease evolves cumulatively over time through a sequence of four events: 1) decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation (increased tear osmolarity); 2) decreased conjunctival goblet-cell density; 3) increased corneal epithelial desquamation; and, finally, 4) destabilization of the cornea-tear interface. In the 1970s, demulcents were introduced to decrease tear film instability. More recently, preservative-free solutions have been shown to decrease corneal desquamation. The newest pharmaceutical available today is known as TheraTears (ATF); in pre-clinical studies it restores conjunctival goblet cells. On the horizon are medications such as 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), which directly stimulate tear production. CONCLUSIONS: As our understanding of the pathogenesis and natural history of dry eye disease has improved, pharmaceuticals have been designed to act at earlier and more crucial points in the disease process. We are now entering a new era in dry eye treatment with the introduction of the first agent that can reverse the basic events of dry eye surface disease.	0

15258689	Tuberculous pericardial effusion: features, tamponade, and computed tomography. The clinical features with particular reference to tamponade and mediastinal adenopathy were studied in tuberculous pericardial effusion. Tamponade is a frequent complication and the recognition of tuberculous etiology can be difficult. Involvement of the pericardium is mostly from mediastinal lymph nodes that have not been studied. This was a prospective cohort study. All patients had large effusions, and underwent pericardiocentesis and chest computed tomography. Patients with tuberculosis had specific therapy. Others with viral/idiopathic effusion served as controls for the computed tomography studies. There were 26 patients with tuberculosis: 18 had tamponade on echocardiography. All had symptoms. Fever (n = 23) and dyspnea (n = 20) were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Pericardial rub was heard in 14, and 3 had enlarged cervical or axillary nodes. Pulmonary tuberculosis was present in 6. Tuberculin skin test measured 17 +/- 3.3 mm. The biopsy specimen showed a granuloma in 22 of 24. All 26 had mediastinal lymph nodes > 10 mm with a mean size of 19.5 +/- 8.6 mm that disappeared (81%) or regressed (19%) on treatment (p < 0.001). Aortopulmonary nodes were most frequently enlarged (65.4%) and hilar the least. Three required pericardiectomy. At follow-up all were doing well. None with viral/idiopathic effusion had lymph node enlargement. Fever, dyspnea, and tamponade were frequent with tuberculosis. The prognosis was good with specific therapy. Mediastinal nodes were enlarged in all and only with tuberculosis and not with viral/idiopathic effusion. Nodes disappeared or regressed with treatment. In the appropriate clinical context, mediastinal lymph node enlargement on chest computed tomography along with a strongly positive skin test results could help in the diagnosis of a tuberculous etiology of pericardial effusion.	0
9236408	Thrombomodulin gene mutations associated with myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: Thrombomodulin is an important receptor for thrombin on the endothelial cell surface of most blood vessels, including those of the heart. Thrombin-bound thrombomodulin activates protein C, which inhibits thrombin generation by degrading factors Va and VIIIa. The aim of this study was to analyze the 5' region of the thrombomodulin gene to determine whether mutations contribute a risk for myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened the promoter region of the thrombomodulin gene by single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis in 104 patients with diagnosed myocardial infarction. Five mutations (three distinct) were identified (GG-9/-10AT, G-33A, and C-133A). The dinucleotide mutation GG-9/-10AT was identified in 3 individuals (2 heterozygous, 1 homozygous). Only one of the three different mutations was identified in 104 patient control subjects matched for age, sex, and race (G-33A in a single individual). All mutations identified were in close proximity to consensus sequences for transcription control elements within the thrombomodulin gene. In contrast, no difference was observed between patients and control subjects for the allelic frequency of a previously identified neutral polymorphism GCC/GTC coding for Ala/Val455, with 3 individuals homozygous for GTC (Val) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that mutations in the promoter region of the thrombomodulin gene may constitute a risk for arterial thrombosis.	0
15916742	Melatonin-selenium nanoparticles protects liver against immunological injury induced by bacillus Calmette-Guerin and lipopolysaccharide. AIM: Melatonin-selenium nanoparticle (MT-Se), a novel complex, was synthesized by preparing selenium nanoparticles in a melatonin medium. The present investigation was designed to determine the protective effects of MT-Se against immunological liver injury in mice induced by bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: The model of immunological liver injury in mice was prepared. The levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino-transferase, nitric oxide (NO) in serum, malondialdehyde content, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) activities in a liver homogenate were assayed by spectrophotometry. The content of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) were determined by ELISA. The splenocyte proliferation was assayed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction. Meanwhile, a hepatic pathological examination was observed. RESULTS: In the BCG/LPS-induced hepatic injury model, MT-Se administered at doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg to the BCG/LPS-treated mice for 10 d significantly reduced the increase in serum aminotransferase, reduced the severe extent of hepatic cell damage and the immigration of inflammatory cells. It also attenuated the increase in the content of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and enhanced the decrease in activities of SOD and GSH-px. In contrast, the treatment with MT-Se suppressed the increase in NO level in both the serum and liver tissue. Furthermore, MT-Se significantly lowered an increase in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in the liver and inhibited the production of TNF- alpha and IL-1beta by peritoneal macrophages. A downregulation effect of MT-Se on splenocyte proliferation was also observed. CONCLUSION: MT-Se showed a hepatic protective action on immunological liver injury in mice.	0

18228173	Genetic imprinting of H19 and IGF2 in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa). The genes insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and H19 express paternally and maternally, respectively, in humans, mice, sheep, and cattle. Additionally, IGF2 has been shown to be regulated by at least four promoters in a tissue- or development-specific manner. In the domestic pigs, the promoter- and tissue-specific imprinting pattern of IGF2 has not been well characterized, nor is the imprinting pattern of H19. In the present study, we identified two polymorphisms in each of IGF2 (exons 2 and 9) and H19 (exons 1 and 5) and determined the imprinting status of these two genes in 13 organs / tissues of week-old pigs. IGF2 P1 transcript is bi-allelically expressed (not imprinted) in all major organs studied, while the majority of IGF2 transcripts are expressed from promoters 2-4 and are imprinted. H19 is exclusively expressed from the maternal allele in all major organs, concurrent with observations in other species.	0
9581908	Double suicide gene (cytosine deaminase and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase) but not single gene transfer allows reliable elimination of tumor cells in vivo. Suicide genes such as cytosine deaminase (CD) and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) encode products that convert nontoxic substances (prodrugs) into toxic metabolites. Suicide gene transfer is currently being used in cancer therapy or can be used as a safety modality. To analyze the reliability of suicide genes as a safety modality for a vaccination study with viable cytokine/B7 gene-modified tumor cells, the individual and combined efficacy of the two suicide genes was compared for in vitro and in vivo cell killing of a murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (TS/A). To adapt the system to an in vivo gene delivery situation, bulk cultures cotransfected with the CD and TK gene were used instead of selected clones. In vitro, both CD and TK conferred sensitivity to the respective prodrug but the combined cytotoxic effects of both gene products were always superior. For in vivo analysis BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with CD- and TK-modified TS/A cells, treated with prodrugs, and tumor size was evaluated for a period of 100 days. In the in vivo situation the combination of both enzyme/prodrug systems was again most effective. The highest single concentration of 5-FC (500 mg/kg) or GCV (100 mg/kg) was not able to fully protect the animals from developing tumors, whereas a combination of 5-FC (250 mg/kg) and GCV (50 mg/kg) resulted in complete tumor eradication. In nude mice treated in the same way, most CD/TK tumors could not be eliminated. Furthermore, BALB/c mice cured of TS/A-CD/TK tumors developed a systemic tumor immunity against challenge with parental TS/A cells. These findings indicate that reliable tumor elimination by the suicide genes depends on T cells. The cooperative effect of both suicide genes was confirmed in vitro with the human renal cell carcinoma line RCC26. We conclude that TK and CD together, but neither gene alone, act as a safety mechanism for the elimination of tumor cells in a reliable fashion and suggest that a rapid and quantitative antigen release by effective TK- and CD-mediated tumor destruction is necessary for T cell immunity to develop.	0

11790729	Novel medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. Two open reading frames which encode the homologues of (all-E) prenyl diphosphate synthase are found in the whole-genome sequence of Sulfolobus solfataricus, a thermoacidophilic archaeon. It has been suggested that one is a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase gene, but the specificity and biological significance of the enzyme encoded by the other have remained unclear. Thus, we isolated the latter by the PCR method, expressed the enzyme in Escherichia coli cells, purified it, and characterized it. The archaeal enzyme, 281 amino acids long, is highly thermostable and requires Mg(2+) and Triton X-100 for full activity. It catalyzes consecutive E-type condensations of isopentenyl diphosphate with an allylic substrate such as geranylgeranyl diphosphate and yields the medium-chain product hexaprenyl diphosphate. Despite such product specificity, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the archaeal medium-chain prenyl diphosphate synthase is distantly related to the other medium- and long-chain enzymes but is closely related to eucaryal short-chain enzymes.	0
8561206	Relationship of aggressive behavior to other neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the relationship between aggressive behavior and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: Consecutively assessed outpatients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease (N = 75) were assessed with the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (33%) had verbal outbursts and 13 patients (17%) engaged in physical aggression in the month prior to assessment. Aggressive patients and nonaggressive patients did not differ regarding age, education, gender, level of depression, or severity of dementia. In the entire group, dysphoria was found in 33%, delusional ideation in 39%, and hallucinations in 16%. Aggressive behavior was more frequent among patients with hallucinations than among those without. Scores on hallucinations and activity disturbance predicted 12% of the variance in total aggressive behavior. When data from patients taking psychotropic medication were excluded from the analysis, hallucination and delusion scores predicted 22% of the variance in the aggression score. Physical aggression was associated with activity disturbance and hallucinations, and verbal aggression was associated with delusional ideation. No other clinical correlates of aggression were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive behavior is a frequent behavioral symptom in Alzheimer's disease. About one-fourth of the variance in aggression could be attributed to psychosis.	0
24291179	Microbial quality of frozen Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) meat samples from three selected farms in Zimbabwe. Microbial quality of frozen Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) meat from three farms in Zimbabwe was assessed based on 2051 samples collected for pre-export testing during 2006 to 2011. Data were perused by season and year in terms of aerobic plate (APC), coliform (CC), Escherichia coli (ECC) and Listeria monocytogenes (LMC) counts and the presence of Salmonella spp. The log10-transformed data were compared among the farms and seasons using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Microbial quality of the samples was graded based on the EC No. 2073.2005 criteria for beef. The mean APC and CC for the crocodile meat differed significantly (P=0.000) among the farms with the highest APC (3.2  0.05 log10 cfu/g) and the lowest (2.7  0.05 log10 cfu/g) recorded from farms A and C, respectively. There were no significant differences (P>0.05) in ECC and LMC among the farms, while Salmonella spp. were only isolated from one farm. Although the microbial quality of frozen crocodile meat from these farms was generally within acceptable limits, the isolation of E. coli and Salmonella spp. is of public health concern. Thus, implementing of measures to control the pasteurizing process and to minimize bacterial contamination of crocodile meat after pasteurization need to be carefully considered.	0

10346985	Quantification of human interleukin 18 mRNA expression by competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a recently identified cytokine, originally called interferon gamma inducing factor, due to its capacity to induce interferon gamma production in Th1 type cells. IL-18 is expressed by a wide variety of cell types including mononuclear phagocytes, osteoblasts, keratinocytes and adrenal cortex cells. To quantify human IL-18 mRNA expression in small-scale cell samples the authors developed a competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using a competitive template as an internal standard. This assay was demonstrated as a valid, sensitive and precise tool to quantify human IL-18 mRNA expression. IL-18 mRNA expression of primary peripheral blood monocytes, CD4(+)T cells, CD8(+)T cells, B cells and NK cells was assessed by competitive RT-PCR. Basal IL-18 expression could be detected in all types of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The kinetics of IL-18 mRNA expression in PBMC from healthy donors was defined in vitro after monocyte-specific (lipopolysaccharide LPS), T-cell-specific (anti-CD3) and polyclonal-unspecific stimulation (phytohaemagglutinin PHA). Only LPS led to a strong increase of IL-18 mRNA expression peaking after 2 h. These results indicate that IL-18 is expressed constitutionally by all major PBMC subtypes. However, only monocyte specific stimulation resulted in a significant induction of IL-18 mRNA expression suggesting activated monocytes e.g. in inflammation as the main source of IL-18 expression.	0

9357982	Different expression of adenylyl cyclase isoforms after retinoic acid induction of P19 teratocarcinoma cells. We have investigated the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and gene expression in retinoic acid (RA)-primed murine P19 teratocarcinoma cells, which recapitulate in vitro the first stages of neuroectodermal formation. Here we show that the P19 stem cells possess a basal Ca2+/CaM-stimulated AC activity, which increases about 10-fold after RA induction. The rise of AC activity is associated with a stage-specific up-regulation of AC2, AC5 and AC8 mRNAs and a down-regulation of AC3 mRNA. P19 cells provide a powerful model to investigate the role and specific regulation of AC isoforms during neuronal differentiation.	0
10427993	Design of highly immunogenic liposomal constructs combining structurally independent B cell and T helper cell peptide epitopes. We have designed liposomal diepitope constructs that allow the physical combination, within the same vesicle, of B and Th epitopes as structurally separate entities. The immune response against such constructs was explored using TPEDPTDPTDPQDPSS (TPE), a B cell epitope originating from a Streptococcus mutans surface adhesin and QYIKANSKFIGITEL (QYI), a \"universal\" Th epitope from tetanus toxin. The two peptides were linked to the outer surface of small (diameter approximately 100 nm) unilamellar liposomes by covalent conjugation to two different anchors. To that end we have developed a strategy that allows the controlled chemical coupling of TPE and QYI, functionalized at their N terminus with a thiol, to preformed liposomes containing thiol-reactive derivatives of phosphatidylethanolamine and the lipopeptide S-[2,3-bis (palmitoyloxy)-(2-RS)-propyl]-N-palmitoyl-(R)-cysteinyl-alanyl-gly cine (Pam3CAG), respectively. This synthetic construct (administered i.p. to BALB/c mice) induced highly intense (titers > 20,000), anamnestic and long-lasting (over 2 years) immune responses, indicating that this strategy is successful. Two parameters were of prime importance to elicit this response with our liposomal diepitope constructs: (1) the simultaneous expression of B and Th epitopes on the same vesicle, and (2) the lipopeptide Pam3CAG anchor of the Th epitope QYI could not be replaced by a phosphatidylethanolamine anchor (a lesser immune response was observed). Analysis of the antibody response revealed a complex pattern; thus, besides the humoral response (production of IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b) a superposition of a T-independent (TI-2 type) response was also found (IgM and IgG3). These results indicate that liposomal diepitope constructs could be attractive in the development of synthetic peptide-based vaccines.	0

8454995	Asphyxial deaths due to hanging in children. A review of the records for five years from the Coroner's Offices of Marion County, Indiana and Franklin County, Ohio, which have a combined population of 2.4 million, yielded 12 cases of hanging deaths in children 13 years of age or younger. The age range was 2 1/2 to 13 years and only two of the 12 victims were female. There were three unequivocal suicides, five accidental deaths and four cases where, despite extensive investigation, the manner of death remained undetermined. The scene and autopsy findings are presented and the cases discussed with regard to determination of manner of death. Additionally, the significance and pathophysiology of petechiae are discussed.	0

15029253	The herpetofauna of the cloud forests of Honduras. The cloud forest amphibians and reptiles constitute the most important herpetofaunal segment in Honduras, due to the prevalence of endemic and Nuclear Middle American-restricted species. This segment, however, is subject to severe environmental threats due to the actions of humans. Of the 334 species of amphibians and reptiles currently known from Honduras, 122 are known to be distributed in cloud forest habitats. Cloud forest habitats are found throughout the mountainous interior of Honduras. They are subject to a Highland Wet climate, which features annual precipitation of >1500 mm and a mean annual temperature of <18 degrees C. Cloud forest vegetation falls into two Holdridge formations, the Lower Montane Wet Forest and Lower Montane Moist Forest. The Lower Montane Wet Forest formation generally occurs at elevations in excess of 1500 m, although it may occur as low as 1300+ m at some localities. The Lower Montane Moist Forest formation generally occurs at 1700+ m elevation. Of the 122 cloud forest species, 18 are salamanders, 38 are anurans, 27 are lizards, and 39 are snakes. Ninety-eight of these 122 species are distributed in the Lower Montane Wet Forest formation and 45 in the Lower Montane Moist Forest formation. Twenty species are distributed in both formations. The cloud forest species are distributed among restricted, widespread, and peripheral distributional categories. The restricted species range as a group in elevation from 1340 to 2700 m, the species that are widespread in at least one of the two cloud forest formations range as a group from sea level to 2744 m, and the peripheral species range as a group from sea level to 1980 m. The 122 cloud forest species exemplify ten broad distributional patterns ranging from species whose northern and southern range termini are in the United States (or Canada) and South America, respectively, to those species that are endemic to Honduras. The largest segment of the herpetofauna falls into the endemic category, with the next largest segment being restricted in distribution to Nuclear Middle America, but not endemic to Honduras. Cloud forest species are distributed among eight ecophysiographic areas, with the largest number being found in the Northwestern Highlands, followed by the North-Central Highlands and the Southwestern Highlands. The greatest significance of the Honduran herpetofauna lies in its 125 species that are either Honduran endemics or otherwise Nuclear Middle American-restricted species, of which 83 are distributed in the country's cloud forests. This segment of the herpetofauna is seriously endangered as a consequence of exponentially increasing habitat destruction resulting from deforestation, even given the existence of several biotic reserves established in cloud forest. Other, less clearly evident environmental factors also appear to be implicated. As a consequence, slightly over half of these 83 species (50.6%) have populations that are in decline or that have disappeared from Honduran cloud forests. These species possess biological, conservational, and economic significance, all of which appear in danger of being lost.	0

20090283	Literacy assessment of family health history tools for public health prevention. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically identify and evaluate the readability and document complexity of currently available family history tools for the general public. METHODS: Three steps were undertaken to identify family history tools for evaluation: (a) Internet searches, (b) expert consultation, and (c) literature searches. Tools identified were assessed for readability using the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) readability formula. The complexity of documents (i.e., forms collecting family history information) was assessed using the PMOSE/IKIRSCH document readability formula. RESULTS: A total of 78 tools were identified, 47 of which met the criteria for inclusion. SMOG reading grade levels for multimedia-based tools ranged from 10.1 to 18.3, with an average score of 13.6. For print-based tools, SMOG ranged from 8.7 to 14.1, with an average score of 12.0. Document complexity ranged from very low complexity (level 1 proficiency) to high complexity (level 4 proficiency). CONCLUSION: The majority of tools are written at a reading grade level that is beyond the 8th grade average reading level in the United States. The lack of family history tools that are easy to read or use may compromise their potential effectiveness in identifying individuals at increased risk for chronic diseases in the general population.	0

The neutral (_-oxo)bis(_-carboxylato)diiron(III) complexes [Fe(2)O(_-XDK)(bpy)(2)(NCS)(2)] (1), [Fe(2)O(_-XDK)(bpy)(2)((15)NCS)(2)] (1a), [Fe(2)O(_-XDK)(bpy)(2)(NCSe)(2)] (2), [Fe(2)O(_-XDK)(bpy)(2)(N(3))(2)] (3), and [Fe(2)O(_-XDK)(bpy)(2)((15)NNN)(2)] (3a), where XDK is the doubly deprotonated form of m-xylylenediamine bis(Kemp's triacid imide) and bpy is 2,2'-bipyridyl, have been synthesized. The octahedrally coordinated iron centers are triply bridged by an oxo group and the two carboxylate groups of XDK. In the X-ray crystal structures of 1 and 2, the diiron centers have C(2) symmetry, whereas in 3 the coordinated azide ligands are also anti with respect to the Fe-O-Fe plane but in different rotational conformations with respect to the Fe-N(3) bond. The optical spectra of these highly colored compounds are characterized by broad ligand-field bands centered approximately 650 nm and a more intense combination of ligand-field and ligand-to-metal charge-transfer bands between 350 and 500 nm. Compounds 1-3 exhibit intense IR bands ( approximately 2050 cm(-)(1)) which are characteristic of terminally bound isothiocyanate, isoselenocyanate, and azide ligands, respectively. These bands shift to lower energies upon substitution with (15)NCS(-) in 1a (Deltanu = 24 cm(-)(1)) and (15)NNN(-) in 3a (Deltanu = 8 cm(-)(1)), and the failure of the latter to reveal two resolved features indicates a need for caution in interpreting analogous data from isotopically substituted protein adducts. Resonance Raman experiments on 1-3 revealed bands ( approximately 520 cm(-)(1)) attributable to the symmetric FeOFe stretching frequency. The M  ssbauer spectra of 1-3 at 77 K display symmetric quadrupole doublets with isomer shifts ( approximately 0.5 mm s(-)(1)) and quadrupole splittings ( approximately 1.7 mm s(-)(1)) typical of (_-oxo)diiron(III) compounds. Crystal data: 1.2C(6)H(6), monoclinic, P2(1)/n, a = 19.6692(2)   , b = 14.3069(1)   , c = 22.6502(3)   , beta = 96.922(1) degrees, V = 6327.4(1)   (3), Z = 4, T = -90 degrees C; 2.2C(6)H(6), monoclinic, C2/c, a = 22.6834(3)   , b = 14.4315(2)   , c = 19.7013(4)   , beta = 97.837(1) degrees, V = 6389.1(2)   (3), Z = 4, T = -85 degrees C; 3.CH(2)Cl(2).C(6)H(3)(CH(3))(3), triclinic, P_onemacr;, a = 12.1645(2)   , b = 14.9196(3)   , c = 18.0690(3)   , alpha = 79.688(1) degrees, beta = 78.611(1) degrees, gamma = 83.453(1) degrees, V = 3152.3(1)   (3), Z = 2, T = -85 degrees C.	0
9932943	Increased therapeutic efficacy with rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody treatment of stroke in the rat. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of an antileukocyte adhesion antibody (anti-CD18) as an adjuvant for delayed (2 hours and 4 hours) thrombolytic therapy (recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator [rt-PA]) in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA is limited in its application by a short therapeutic window. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to MCAO by a single fibrin-rich clot. The rats were assigned to the following experimental groups: Experiment 1 (treatment 2 hours after embolization), 1) rt-PA, 2) anti-CD18 antibody, 3) rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody, 4) immunoglobulin (Ig) G, and 5) vehicle; Experiment 2 (treatment 4 hours after occlusion), 1) rt-PA alone, 2) rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody, and 3) nontreated control group. Neurologic deficits, infarction volume, hemorrhage, and brain myeloperoxidase (MPO) immunoreactivity were measured. RESULTS: Administration of rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody 2 hours later reduced significantly (p < 0.05) the infarct volume and improved neurologic deficits compared with the vehicle-treated group. Treatment with rt-PA alone improved neurologic deficits significantly and reduced mean infarct volume compared with the vehicle-treated group. However, treatment with anti-CD18 antibody neither reduced infarct volume nor improved neurologic deficits compared with the IgG-treated group. The combination of rt-PA and anti-CD18 antibody treatment at 4 hours reduced significantly the infarct volume and MPO immunoreactive cells compared with rt-PA treatment alone at 4 hours, and reduced neurologic deficits compared with rt-PA treatment alone and compared with the nontreated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of antileukocyte adhesion antibody and thrombolytic therapy may increase the therapeutic window for the treatment of stroke.	0
23085059	Clinical effectiveness protocols for imaging in the management of ureteral calculous disease: AUA technology assessment. PURPOSE: This technology assessment addresses the optimal use of imaging in the evaluation and treatment of patients with suspected or documented ureteral stones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search addressing 4 guiding questions was performed for full text in English articles published between January 1990 and July 2011. The search focused on major subtopics associated with the imaging of ureteral calculi, and included specific imaging modalities used in the diagnosis and management of ureteral calculous disease such as unenhanced (noncontrast) computerized tomography, conventional radiography, ultrasound, excretory urography, magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear medicine studies. Protocols (in the form of decision tree algorithms) were developed based on this literature review and in some instances on panel opinion. The 4 questions addressed were 1) What imaging study should be performed for suspected ureteral calculous disease? 2) What information should be obtained? 3) After diagnosis of a ureteral calculus, what followup imaging should be used? 4) After treatment of a ureteral calculus, what followup imaging studies should be obtained? RESULTS: Based on these protocols, noncontrast computerized tomography is recommended to establish the diagnosis in most cases, with a low energy protocol advocated if body habitus is favorable. Conventional radiography and ultrasound are endorsed for monitoring the passage of most radiopaque stones as well as for most patients undergoing stone removal. Other studies may be indicated based on imaging findings, and patient, stone and clinical factors. CONCLUSIONS: The protocols generated assist the clinician in establishing the diagnosis of ureteral calculous disease, monitoring stone passage and following patients after treatment. The protocols take into account not only clinical effectiveness but also cost-effectiveness and risk/harm associated with the various imaging modalities.	0

7610711	[Surgical treatment of idiopathic thoracolumbar scoliosis: Contrell-Dubousset instrumentation versus ventral derotation spondylodesis]. Especially in idiopathic thoracolumbar scoliosis the approach and sort of instrumentation have controversially been discussed over the past years. Since 1986 32 patients with adolescent thoracolumbar scoliosis underwent operative treatment, 20 patients were treated with Cotrel-Dubousset Instrumentation (CDI), 10 patients underwent Ventral Derotation Spondylodesis (VDS). In 2 cases a combined two-stage VDS and CDI were performed. The follow-up was 38 months in the CDI-group and 19 months in the VDS-group. Length of the curve and the fusion were identical in the VDS-group. In the CDI-group, however, length of the fusion exceeded curve length by 4 segments on average. With CDI the fusion was carried down to L4 in most cases, in some cases to L5. Curve correction of the primary curve averaged 70% with VDS (preoperative mean 84 degrees) and 64% with CDI (preoperative mean 65 degrees). We observed a spontaneous correction of the secondary curve of 38% after VDS. With CDI the correction of the secondary curve averaged 42%, however, in secondary curves measuring more than 50 degrees primary and secondary curve were fused. A preoperatively physiological sagittal plane in the CDI-group remained unchanged after operative treatment. With VDS an average kyphosis of the thoracolumbar junction of +22 degrees was corrected to +7 degrees. We conclude that in the operative treatment of severe thoracolumbar scoliosis VDS offers significant advantages compared to CDI and should therefore be preferred. In moderate scoliotic deformities, where the number of caudally unfused segments is equal in both systems, CDI is justified.	0

16426193	Effects of diet on clinical signs of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in dogs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of dietary modification on clinical signs of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in dogs. DESIGN: Blinded randomized crossover study. ANIMALS: 21 dogs with EPI. PROCEDURE: Dogs were fed the diet they received at home for 2 weeks. Thereafter, they received 3 special diets (a high-fat diet, a high-fiber diet, and a highly digestible low-residue diet) for 3 weeks each. Owners scored dogs daily for the last 2 weeks of each 3-week period for severity of 6 clinical signs including appetite, defecation frequency, consistency of feces, borborygmus, flatulence, and coprophagia. An EPI index was calculated for each dog by adding the daily scores for each clinical sign. RESULTS: Significant differences in daily EPI indices among diets were observed in 20 dogs. The original diet appeared to be the most suitable in 8 dogs, whereas the high-fat diet was most suitable in 5 dogs, the high-fiber diet was most suitable in 4 dogs, and the low-residue diet was most suitable in 2 dogs. In 1 dog, the lowest EPI index score was the same during the original diet and the high-fat diet feeding periods. One dog did not complete the feeding period for the high-fiber diet. Differences in mean EPI indices among diets were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that responses to different diets varied among individual dogs. Because responses to the feeding regimens were unpredictable, it is suggested that feeding regimens be individually formulated for dogs with EPI.	0

12735824	Catheter management related to radical retropubic prostatectomy. The clinical course of 108 consecutive radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) patients with regards to postoperative cystograms and suprapubic cystostomy was retrospectively reviewed. All patients had a urethral Foley (UF), suprapubic catheter (SP) and were discharged with both catheters in place. Two of 9 patients who had excessive drainage had biochemical evidence of urine. Cystogram on these 2 patients, deferred till days 19 and 27, was normal. Among the other 7 patients with excessive JP drainage, only 1 showed a minor anastomotic look on day 15, necessitating catheter drainage for 1 additional week, with uneventful Foley removal then. Ten patients showed some degree of extravasation on the initial cystograms, 6 patients were judged to be insignificant and the catheter was removed the same day, 4 patients had extravasation (performed days 7, 13, 15, 22) which warranted repeat cystogram 1 week later, which then turned out to be normal. Five patients experienced problems with the UF early in the postoperative period and the SP served as a backup for bladder drainage. The SP entails negligible morbidity and may serve a useful function in the most critical early postoperative period. Based on our data, routine cystogram prior to catheter removal did not appear to alter the management of the catheters significantly and appears unnecessary, especially if the catheter is left in situ for close to 3 weeks prior to removal. In selected cases where technical anastomotic problems were encountered or if delayed healing was anticipated, a c;ystogram prior to catheter removal would still be available.	0
10157966	Considerations in establishing visiting consultant clinics in rural hospital communities. Establishing specialty clinics staffed by visiting medical consultants is one way that rural hospitals can increase local access to specialty care. This example of private sector-driven regionalization of health care services typically involves an agreement among urban specialists, rural hospitals, and local primary care physicians. The urban-based physicians provide limited on-site specialty services in the rural community for patients who are referred by local physicians or self-refer to the specialty clinics. The trend toward formalization of regional relationships across large geographic areas prompts both opportunity and need for careful consideration of visiting specialty clinic arrangements in rural hospital communities. This article delineates advantages and disadvantages associated with the development of Visiting Consulting Clinics (VCC) along with some   ground rules   to consider when establishing this type of service.	0

16219172	Analysis of the expression of Fas, FasL and Bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disorders. To investigate the expression of apoptosis-related protein (Fas, FasL, and Bcl-2) in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disorders (ATDs), immunohistochemical staining was performed on 20 Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), 20 Graves' disease (GD), and 20 thyroid follicular adenoma (TFA, as control). All the cases expressed Fas, mainly on the cell surface and cytoplasm. FasL was found in 17 cases of the TFA. Bcl-2 was detected in 15 cases of HT, 19 of GD and 17 of TFA. In TFA, a moderate Fas expression and a minimal or no FasL expression was detected on follicular cells. In HT, the follicles adjacent to infiltrating lymphocytes showed increased levels of Fas and FasL expression. A weaker staining of Fas and FasL was exhibited on infiltrating lymphocytes than on thyrocytes. In a comparison of GD with HT, thyrocytes and lymphocytes showed similar Fas staining, but for FasL the staining was rather weaker in HT. The expression of Bcl-2 was nearly identical in GD and TFA, but much weaker on the follicular cells in vicinity of lymphocytes and on the lymphocytes located in germinal centers of HT tissues. The expression of Fas, FasL, Bcl-2 in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease were almost same. FasL strong expression and Bcl-2 weak expression on the follicles in HT may induce apoptosis. These results provided evidence for expression of Fas, FasL and Bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease. The lymphocytes seem not to be directly engaged in the process via their own FasL, but they may provide some cytokines that, in turn, upregulate Fas and/or FasL expression to induce apoptosis.	0
11176868	Research opportunities and advances in lung disease. Lung diseases cause morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Susceptibility to pathogenesis of most lung diseases result from a complex interaction of a relevant challenge from the environment, genetic background, and the nature of the host responses. Cutting-edge research in lung disease now centers on understanding the lung as a genetically determined biological organ that functions to mediate gas exchange and defend against a hostile environment. A major challenge is to determine the hierarchy of gene expression that integrates the function of multiple cell types in this complex anatomy. Emerging therapies that will play a major role in the future treatment of lung disease include the use of recombinant proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, cell therapy (including stem cells), and gene therapy. Future advances will include the cure of the major hereditary lung disorders by gene therapy, new treatment for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial lung disease; development of vaccines to protect the lung from major lung pathogens; and pathogen-specific \"designer\" therapies to eradicate chronic lung infections.	0

21453450	Images of colonic real-time tissue sonoelastography correlate with those of colonoscopy and may predict response to therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis. BACKGROUND: Real-time tissue sonoelastography (EG) is a new non-invasive technique that visualizes differences in tissue strain. We evaluated the usefulness of EG in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) by investigating the association between EG and colonoscopic findings and disease activity. METHODS: Thirty-seven UC patients undergoing EG and colonoscopy were invited to enroll. EG findings were classified as normal, homogeneous, random, or hard, and colonoscopic findings as normal, mucosal edema and erosion, punched-out ulcer, and extensive mucosal abrasion. Clinical findings were evaluated using clinical activity index (CAI) scores for each patient at colonoscopy. RESULTS: On EG, 10 cases were classified as normal, 11 as homogeneous, 6 as random, and 10 as hard. EG findings showed a significant correlation those of colonoscopy (p < 0.001). Seven of 10 (70%) normal-type patients were in the remission phase, while all 6 random-type patients were in the active phase. Among active-phase patients, 4 of 7 (57%) homogeneous-type patients responded to steroid or leukocytapheresis therapy, while 3 of 6 (50%) random-type patients required treatment with cyclosporine. Three of 10 (30%) hard-type patients required colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: In this small series, EG findings reflected colonoscopic findings and correlated with disease activity among patients with UC.	0
19031053	Biosorption of Cr(VI) from water using biomass of Aeromonas hydrophila: central composite design for optimization of process variables. The potential use of biomass of Aeromonas hydrophila for biosorption of chromium from aqueous solution was investigated. The variables (pH, initial Cr(VI) concentration, biomass dose, and temperature) affecting process were optimized by performing minimum number of experimental runs with the help of central composite design. The results predicted by design were found to be in good agreement (R2 = 99.1%) with those obtained by performing experiments. Multiple regression analysis shows that uptake decreases with increase in pH and biomass dose, whereas it increases with increase in temperature and concentration. The maximum removal of Cr(VI) predicted by contour and optimization plots was 184.943 mg/g at pH 1.5, initial Cr(VI) concentration 311.97 mg/L, temperature 60 degrees C, and biomass dose 1.0 g. The removal of Cr(VI) was governed by adsorption of Cr(VI) as well as its reduction into Cr(III), which further gets adsorbed. The sorption capacity of biomass was calculated from experimental data using Langmuir sorption model and was found to be 151.50 mg/g at 40 degrees C and pH 1.5, which is comparable to other biosorbents. In addition to this, Dubinin-Radushkevich model was applied, and it was found that nature of sorption was chemisorption.	0
11243474	Is writer's cramp caused by a deficit of sensorimotor integration? Writer's cramp is a highly specific movement disorder in which handwriting is impaired while most other manual skills are often unaffected. On the basis of abnormal findings in experiments measuring the control of grip forces, it has been suggested that writer's cramp is caused by a deficit of sensorimotor integration. The aim of our study was to determine whether there is a functional link between sensory deficits, abnormalities in the control of grip force, and handwriting disorders. We compared the grip force and handwriting performance of writer's cramp patients with that of control subjects and with that of a stroke patient suffering a purely somatosensory deficit of his dominant hand (patient S1). We found that: (1) writer's cramp patients and patient S1 had elevated grip-force levels; (2) training reduced the grip force to near-normal levels in all writer's cramp patients but not in S1; (3) effortful writing performance also induced increased grip-force levels in healthy subjects; and (4) patient S1 had normal handwriting movements. These findings suggest that the elevated pretraining gripforce levels of writer's cramp patients might be a consequence of their effortful writing style and do not reflect a deficit of sensorimotor integration. Moreover, the good handwriting performance of patient S1 shows that a severe somatosensory deficit is not a sufficient condition for a handwriting disorder. These findings disagree with the sensorimotor explanation of writer's cramp.	0
12588209	Effect of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and naproxen on short-term risk of acute myocardial infarction in the elderly. BACKGROUND: Recent debate has emerged regarding the cardiovascular safety of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors and the possible cardioprotective effect of naproxen sodium. We compared the rates of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among elderly patients dispensed selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, naproxen, and nonselective nonnaproxen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using administrative health care data from Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1998, to March 31, 2001. We identified NSAID-naive cohorts of subjects aged 66 years and older in whom treatment was initiated with celecoxib (n = 15 271), rofecoxib (n = 12 156), naproxen (n = 5669), and nonnaproxen nonselective NSAIDs (n = 33 868), along with a randomly selected control cohort not exposed to NSAIDs (n = 100 000). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare AMI rates between study drug groups while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Relative to control subjects, the multivariate model showed no significant differences in AMI risk for new users of celecoxib (adjusted rate ratio [aRR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-1.2), rofecoxib (aRR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4), naproxen (aRR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7), or nonnaproxen nonselective NSAIDs (aRR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this observational study suggest no increase in the short-term risk of AMI among users of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors as commonly used in clinical practice. Furthermore, the findings do not support a short-term reduced risk of AMI with naproxen.	0

21785329	Microarray comparative genomic hybridization detection of copy number changes in desmoplastic melanoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) can appear morphologically and immunophenotypically similar. We attempted to determine whether microarray comparative genomic hybridization could detect copy number differences between them to aid in the diagnosis. S-100 immunohistochemistry was performed on 5 cases of DM and 9 cases of MPNST using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Genomic DNA was extracted from microdissected cells. Whole genome amplification was performed on 5 of 5 DMs and 6 of 9 MPNST cases. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay was used to determine the quality of the DNA samples, which were run on the Spectral Chip 2600 bacterial artificial chromosome array platform. DM showed gains involving chromosomes 1p, 2p, 9q, 13q, 14q, and 20q and losses involving chromosomes 5p, 11p, 12q, 15q, and 18q. Several cancer-associated genes were involved, including gain of BCL2L1, ARTN, AMPK, NRAS, and CCNA1 and loss of IGF2, CDKN1C, PAX6, WT1, TRAF6, MAPK8IP1, and IMP3. MPNST had gains involving chromosomes 1p, 2q, and 19p and loss of chromosome 21q. Gains of MUM1, APC2, MAP2K2, JMJD2B, SP110, PTMA, GPI, and CDKN2D were detected. DM and MPNST have chromosomal alterations detected by array comparative genomic hybridization that might be useful in distinguishing these 2 tumors, although further studies with a larger sample size will be needed to test this.	0
17531503	Modeling smoking history: a comparison of different approaches in the MARS study on age-related maculopathy. PURPOSE: Smoking is an established risk factor for the development of age-related maculopathy (ARM), and its end stage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We evaluated the benefit of various smoking-related variables in modeling the association of smoking with ARM and AMD in a mixed sample of current, former, and never smokers. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in participants of the Muensteraner Altern- und Retina-Studie (MARS). Participants were classified according to the Rotterdam classification system as healthy, or having ARM or AMD. Using multinomial logistic regression techniques, the association with number of cigarettes, years of smoking, pack-years and time since cessation in former smokers were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age of the 982 participants (58.6% females) was 70.9 +/- 5.5 years. ARM was present in 483 (49.2%) and AMD in 285 (29.0%) individuals. The adjusted prevalence odds ratio (OR) in current smokers versus never smokers was 2.61 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-5.09) for ARM and 3.94 (95% CI 1.91-8.14) for AMD. This effect decreased in former smokers with an OR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.33-0.99) per log-transformed time since smoking cessation for ARM and an OR = 0.52 (95% CI 0.30-0.90) for AMD. CONCLUSIONS: By including a variable for time since smoking cessation, we were able to handle current, former, and never smokers in one model that estimates the association of smoking with ARM or AMD. Logarithmical transformation of the time since smoking cessation seemed to increase the model fit and to reflect a non-linear protective effect of smoking cessation on the onset of ARM and AMD in former smokers.	0

21378488	The intrinsic risk factors for ACL ruptures: an evidence-based review. This article aims to assess the evidence related to the intrinsic risk factors for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. The level of evidence (according to evidence-based guidelines) for each study and the level of certainty for each risk factor were determined. After a review of the evidence, femoral notch geometry was the only risk factor that was found to be associated with risk of ACL rupture with high certainty. This review concludes that more research, particularly high-quality, prospective studies, are required to provide accurate measures of risk. These data should be used to establish multifactorial risk factor models designed to identify individuals at high risk of sustaining an ACL injury.	0

20112961	Molecular dynamics study of naturally occurring defects in self-assembled monolayer formation. One of the major challenges for nanofabrication, in particular microcontact printing (mu-CP), is the control of molecular diffusion, or \"ink spreading\", for the creation of nanopatterns with minimized \"smudging\" at pattern boundaries. In this study, fully atomistic computer simulations were used to measure the impact of naturally occurring domain boundaries on the diffusion of excess alkanethiol ink molecules on printed alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAM). A periodic unit cell containing approximately one million atoms and with a surface area of 56 nm x 55 nm was used to model a hexadecanethiol SAM on Au(111), featuring SAM domain boundaries and a range of concentrations of excess hexadecanethiol ink molecules diffusing on top. This model was simulated for a total of approximately 80 ns of molecular dynamics. The simulations reveal that domain boundaries impede the diffusion of excess ink molecules and can, in some cases, permanently trap excess inks. There is competition between ink spreading and ink trapping, with the ink/SAM interaction strongly dependent on both the ink concentration and the SAM orientation at domain boundaries. SAM defects thus provide potential diffusion barriers for the control of excess ink spreading, and simulations also illustrate atom-scale mechanisms for the repair of damaged areas of the SAM via self-healing. The ability of domain boundaries to trap excess ink molecules is accounted for using an accessible volume argument, and trapping is discussed in relation to experimental efforts to reduce molecular spreading on SAMs for the creation of ultrahigh resolution nanopatterns.	0
7511701	Myelination in cerebellar slice cultures: development of a system amenable to biochemical analysis. Myelin deposition and maintenance are critical to proper function of the mammalian nervous system. Previous investigations of myelination in the central nervous system (CNS) were hampered by the lack of an in vitro system that can faithfully reproduce in vivo events yet is amenable to biochemical investigation. We have developed a procedure, based on organotypic cultures, which permits efficient preparation of large numbers of cerebellar slice cultures that can be easily manipulated. Cultures have been examined to document myelination biochemically (by incorporation of [35S]sulfate into sulfolipids), immunohistochemically (by labeling the myelin components myelin basic protein and galactocerebroside), and morphologically (by both light and electron microscopy). We tested the effects of biologically active peptides and antibodies on myelination in the thin slices. The results indicate that the cultures provide an in vitro system that can be used to examine specific cellular events that occur during CNS myelination.	0
7504500	Study of Listeria monocytogenes contamination in a dairy plant and characterization of the strains isolated. From 1988 to 1990, a dairy plant was examined for Listeria contamination. Three hundred and forty samples were collected and analysed for the presence of Listeria. Sixty-one Listeria strains (L. monocytogenes, 44, and L. innocua, 17) were isolated from four varieties of cheese, cheese brines, process equipment and plant environment. The L. monocytogenes strains were recovered during the ripening and rind washing stages and not before, so it is likely that cheese contamination occurred at these points in the manufacturing process. The characterization of the isolated L. monocytogenes strains by serotyping and phage typing showed different serovars and phagovars. Some strains with the same serovar and the same phagovar were isolated from cheeses and process equipment (shelves) indicating that cheese contamination occurs during ripening. Only one profile was found from the analysis of the ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene restriction patterns of 38 L. monocytogenes strains with different serovars and phagovars. This suggests that all L. monocytogenes strains isolated in the dairy plant could have been derived from a single ancestral group.	0

22591809	Paroxysmal tonic upgaze in normal children: a case series and a review of the literature. The purpose of this review was to update the clinical characteristics of paroxysmal tonic upgaze in neurodevelopmentally normal children. We made the diagnosis (between 2008 and 2010) in 8 infants referred to us with suspected epilepsy. We found 38 further cases in the literature. In the 46 children (29 boys and 17 girls) tonic upward ocular deviation was first noticed between the age of 2 weeks and 90 months (median: 9 months). This tendency persisted for between 1 and 48 months (median: 7 months). The duration of paroxysmal events was highly variable: brief events lasted between 3 s and 10 min in 50% of the cases, intermediate events between 5 s and 30 min and long events between 10 s and 2 h. The frequency ranged from one every 3 months to 10 per day. In 15 children the episodes of upward deviation of the eyes were associated with an impaired movement coordination. In 2 further children an impaired movement coordination was noted during febrile illnesses. The results of this review in normal children characterize the entity as follows: onset under 2 years of age, a small predilection for the male gender, eventual improvement and recovery, and impaired movement coordination.	0
12946445	Immunomodulatory affect of R10 fraction of garlic extract on natural killer activity. Naturally occurring modulators of carcinogenesis, including dietary compounds, can either stimulate or inhibit cancer development. Mechanisms responsible for these effects are unknown. Garlics used in this study were freshly prepared, and their effectiveness in augmenting natural killer (NK) activity was evaluated. Administration of 20 mg/kg produced an optimum augmentation of NK activity. A glycoprotein with MW of about 14 kDa was isolated from garlic extract and its activity was assessed. It could induce NK augmentation against K562 tumor cell line. In vivo studies also confirmed that Fraction Residue 10 (R10) of garlic extract partially purified by ultra filtration and further purified by chromatography could induce a resistance to the growth of spontaneous mammary carcinoma in Balb/c mice. NK cytotoxic activities were evaluated by flowcytometry.	0
10620612	Regulation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (Jnk) gene expression during T cell activation. The c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) are a group of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases that participate in signal transduction events mediating specific cellular functions. Activation of JNK is regulated by phosphorylation in response to cellular stress and inflammatory cytokines. Here, we demonstrate that JNK is regulated by a second, novel mechanism. Induction of Jnk gene expression is required in specific tissues before activation of this signaling pathway. The in vivo and in vitro ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) leads to induction of JNK gene and protein expression. TCR signals are sufficient to induce JNK expression, whereas JNK phosphorylation also requires CD28-mediated costimulatory signals. Therefore, both expression and activation contribute to the regulation of the JNK pathway to ensure proper control during the course of an immune response.	0

10605379	Synthesis and calcium channel antagonist activity of dialkyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-[4-(1-methoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydropyridyl)]-3 ,5- pyridinedicarboxylates. A novel class of dialkyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-[4-(1- methoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydropyridyl)]-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylates (8-14) were synthesized and evaluated as calcium channel antagonists. The differences in activity among members of this new class of compounds was less than one log unit (IC50 range of 1.12 x 10(-6) to 8.57 x 10(-6) M), relative to the reference drug nifedipine (IC50 = 1.43 x 10(-8) M). The small differences in potency, irrespective of the size of the dialkyl (Me, Et, i-Pr, i-Bu) ester substituents, is attributed to the fact that the N-CO2Me substituent is too far removed from the C-3 and C-5 ester substituents to undergo non-bonded steric interactions. The 4-[4-(1-methoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydropyridyl) moiety in this new class of compounds is bioisosteric with a C-4 4-nitrophenyl, or a 4-pyridyl, substituent in classical 1,4-dihydropyridines.	0
16129536	Aerobic 2- and 4-nitroreduction of CB 1954 by human liver. 5-(Aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (CB 1954) is an anti-tumour prodrug which recently entered clinical trials in combination with Escherichia coli nitroreductase in a gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) context. A Phase I trial of the prodrug, however, revealed dose-limiting hepatotoxicity (transaminitis). The aim of this study was to find out whether the prodrug undergoes reductive metabolism in human liver to cytotoxic metabolites which may contribute to this clinical toxicity. CB 1954 (2.5-250 microM) was incubated with human liver preparations (2-8 mg/mL of S9, cytosolic or microsomal proteins) in the presence of NAD(P)H (1 mM). The NADH- and NADPH-dependent formation of both 2- and 4-nitroreduction products was demonstrated, with NADPH being the preferred cofactor, by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The major metabolite formed in all three human liver preparations was the 4-hydroxylamine, a potent DNA cross-linking cytotoxin. The 2-hydroxylamine and 2-amine metabolites were also detected, both of which have also been demonstrated to be highly cytotoxic. 2-Nitroreduction was far greater in S9 compared with cytosol and was not detected in microsomal preparations. Although 2- and 4-nitroreduction of CB 1954 was inhibited under hyperoxic conditions, substantial metabolism was observed under atmospheric oxygen levels. These studies demonstrate that human liver is capable of aerobic reductive bioactivation of CB 1954 to cytotoxic metabolites in vitro, possibly involving multiple enzymes, which may account for the clinical hepatotoxicity observed.	0

21536150	Comparative genomics and the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of bovine adapted Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition to causing severe invasive infections in humans, Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B Streptococcus (GBS), is also a major cause of bovine mastitis. Here we provide the first genome sequence for S. agalactiae isolated from a cow diagnosed with clinical mastitis (strain FSL S3-026). Comparison to eight S. agalactiae genomes obtained from human disease isolates revealed 183 genes specific to the bovine strain. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening for the presence/absence of a subset of these loci in additional bovine and human strains revealed strong differentiation between the two groups (Fisher exact test: p<0.0001). The majority of the bovine strain-specific genes (    85%) clustered tightly into eight genomic islands, suggesting these genes were acquired through lateral gene transfer (LGT). This bovine GBS also contained an unusually high proportion of insertion sequences (4.3% of the total genome), suggesting frequent genomic rearrangement. Comparison to other mastitis-causing species of bacteria provided strong evidence for two cases of interspecies LGT within the shared bovine environment: bovine S. agalactiae with Streptococcus uberis (nisin U operon) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (lactose operon). We also found evidence for LGT, involving the salivaricin operon, between the bovine S. agalactiae strain and either Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus salivarius. Our findings provide insight into mechanisms facilitating environmental adaptation and acquisition of potential virulence factors, while highlighting both the key role LGT has played in the recent evolution of the bovine S. agalactiae strain, and the importance of LGT among pathogens within a shared environment.	0

21783528	Extruding auditory hair cells in rats exposed to subchronic 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile. Hair cell loss by extrusion of nearly intact cells towards the endolimphatic cavity has been reported in the vestibular epithelia of rats subchronically exposed to 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN). To investigate whether hair cell extrusion also occurs in the auditory system, adult male Long-Evans rats were exposed to IDPN through drinking water (0.2-0.4% for 4-14 weeks), and their organ of Corti were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. IDPN exposure caused loss and protrusion of the outer hair cells. The surface appearance of the protruding outer hair cells was similar to that of extruding vestibular hair cells. However, the former showed cell shrinkage and irregularly shaped nucleus, by contrast to the almost normal ultrastructure shown by the latter. The results indicate that outer hair cells can suffer extrusion, but the final outcome of this process (complete extrusion versus apoptosis) remains to be determined.	0
18583072	Dry powder inhalers (DPIs)--a review of device reliability and innovation. A wide range of dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices are currently available on the market to deliver drugs into lungs with a view to maximise drug delivery with low variability. DPIs also face numerous clinical challenges, particularly related to variable patient factors such as age, clinical condition and inspiratory flow. Due to the drug formulation and the design of devices, different DPIs do not show the same performance and manufacturers are taking a variety of device design approaches. The characteristics of an ideal DPI, recent innovations in powder formulation and device design are not universally reliable in terms of dose variability, clinical efficacy, user friendliness and economy. This mini review examines whether device reliability is more important than innovation. This study enables a comparison of the relative merits of optimising existing DPIs or seeking to develop novel devices.	0
19625113	Stimulatory effect of apigenin-6-C-beta-L-fucopyranoside on insulin secretion and glycogen synthesis. In vivo and in vitro treatments were carried out to investigate the effects of apigenin-6-C-beta-L-fucopyranoside (1), isolated from Averrhoa carambola L. (Oxalidaceae), on serum glucose and insulin levels in hyperglycemic rats as well as its effect on glycogen synthesis in normal rat soleus muscle. Apigenin-6-C-beta-L-fucopyranoside showed an acute effect on blood glucose lowering in hyperglycemic rats and stimulated glucose-induced insulin secretion. A stimulatory effect of 1 on glycogen synthesis was observed when muscles were incubated with this flavonoid and also its effect was completely nullified by pre-treatment with insulin signal transduction inhibitors. Taking this into account, the MAPK-PP1 and PI3K-GSK3 pathways are involved in the apigenin-6-C-beta-L-fucopyranoside-induced increase in glycogen synthesis in muscle. This study provides evidence for dual effects of apigenin-6-C-beta-L-fucopyranoside as an antihyperglycemic (insulin secretion) as well as an insulinomimetic (glycogen synthesis) agent.	0
23360486	Interprofessional clinical training improves self-efficacy of health care students. BACKGROUND: Interprofessional collaboration potentially enhances patient safety and satisfaction, and reduces tensions and conflicts among health professionals. However, health professionals often lack sufficient knowledge of other professional roles and competences to engage in interprofessional teamwork. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of an interprofessional training programme on students' perceived self-efficacy. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study with an intervention group (239 students) and a control group (405 students). The intervention was an interprofessional clinical study (ICS) unit including students from nursing, medicine, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, laboratory technology and radiography. Data on students' perceived self-efficacy were collected through web-based questionnaires. Aspects of self-efficacy measured were: (1) collaboration with other professions in planning goals and actions for patients; (2) collaboration with other professions for rehabilitation; (3) identifying the functions of other professions and (4) assessing and describing patients' needs and problems. RESULTS: All scores of perceived self-efficacy for the ICS group improved over time although one score change was non-significant (p   =   0.08). After adjustment for baseline differences and the score change for the control group, the ICS group's self-efficacy score gain remained statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The study showed that interprofessional training improved students' perception of self-efficacy more than traditional clinical training.	0

20946445	GYNOTEL: telephone advice to gynaecological surgical patients after discharge. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate in surgical gynaecological patients the types of health problems arising or persisting up to six weeks after discharge and the effectiveness of telephone advice. BACKGROUND: The decreasing length of hospital stay has increased the need for specific instructions about the postdischarge period. Telephone advice could be a valuable tool to address this problem. To our knowledge, postdischarge health problems and the value of telephone advice have not been investigated among gynaecological patients. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. METHODS: Gynaecological patients expected to stay in the ward longer than 24   hour were invited to participate. A pilot study showed that wound healing, pain, mobility, urination, defecation and vaginal bleeding were the most common health problems postdischarge. Based on that information, guidelines were formulated that were used by trained nurses to give telephone advice to the intervention group (n=235), in addition to the usual care. The control group of gynaecological patients (n=233) received usual care only. RESULTS: Of all 468 participants, about 50% were operated for general gynaecology. At discharge, wound pain (56%), mobility problems (54%) and constipation (27%) were the most frequently mentioned problems in both groups. Participants who completely followed the advice with regard to wound healing (p=0.02), pain (p=0.01), vaginal bleeding (p=0.03) and mobility (p=0.04) experienced greater improvement than participants who did not follow, or only partly followed, the advice. CONCLUSIONS: The telephone advice appears to make a significant contribution to help gynaecological surgical patients to solve or reduce their postdischarge health problems. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The positive effect of such advice can be interpreted as an improvement in the quality of life of the postoperative gynaecological patient.	0

20975248	Activation of b3-adrenergic receptor inhibits ventricular arrhythmia in heart failure through calcium handling. Ventricular arrhythmia in chronic heart failure (CHF) is considered to be associated with stimulation of b-adrenergic receptors (b-ARs). Three classes of b-ARs have been identified; importantly, distinct from b1 and b2 subtypes, b3-AR could inhibit arrhythmia. Intracellular Ca2+ is considered as a predominant effecter of arrhythmia during heart failure. However, the exact role of b3-AR in arrhythmia and Ca2+ regulation in CHF is not clear yet. Therefore, we studied the effect of BRL37344, a specific b3-AR activator, on CHF-related ventricular arrhythmia and cellular Ca2+ transport. Rabbits with CHF induced by combined aortic insufficiency and aortic constriction were treated with BRL37344 in the presence or absence of b1-AR and b2-AR stimulation. We then evaluated the current produced by sodium calcium exchanger (INCX), an electrical marker of abnormal Ca2+ removal through ion transporter protein sodium calcium exchanger (NCX), Ca2+ transient, a sign of Ca2+ entering the cell, concentration of Ca2+ in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (SR Ca2+ load) and its abnormal release (SR Ca2+ leak). After treatment with BRL37344, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias induced by infusion of a b1-AR or b2-AR activator decreased significantly. Similarly, b3-AR stimulation remarkably inhibited increase of INCX, Ca2+ transient, SR Ca2+ load and leak induced by activation of b1-AR or b2-AR. SR59230A, a specific b3-AR blocker, abolished the inhibitory effects of BRL37344. These results suggest that b3-AR activation could inhibit ventricular arrhythmia through regulating intracellular Ca2+. Thus, b3-AR is a feasible therapeutic target that holds promise in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in CHF.	0

18669217	[Near-death experiences: fact and fancy]. Seeing a bright light at the end of a tunnel or having a sense of being out of the physical body are phenomena that some patients report after having been close to death. Some spiritual and psychological theories have been developed in order to explain these near-death-experiences. Clinical studies have aimed to determine their frequency and to assess their precipitating factors. Recent neuroimaging studies, however, have shown the involvement of the temporo-parietal cortex in the generation of out-of-body experiences and are offering a physiological, neurological account for the phenomenon, rebuffing dualistic, non-physical explanations.	0
9414491	Chiral recognition detected by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Detection of chiral recognition in various intermolecular interaction systems using mass spectrometry has become important for the modern fields of analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry due to the characteristic nature of the rapid method and the trace amount needed. This review presents the various methods for detecting and evaluating chiral recognition used primarily in fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Emphasis is put on fundamentals and applications of these methods for variously existing enantioselective intermolecular interaction systems.	0
8460396	Chromosomal location and structure of amplicons in two human cell lines with coamplification of c-myc and Ki-ras oncogenes. Gene amplification is a major mechanism through which oncogenes and genes responsible for drug resistance are overexpressed in neoplastic cells, and several models for structure of amplified units (amplicons) are postulated. In order to identify consistent changes associated with oncogene amplification, we analyzed chromosomal location and physical distance of amplicons of two independent human cell lines that have coamplified c-myc and Ki-ras oncogenes. In one cell line, KHC287, amplified c-myc genes were localized in two chromosomes and Ki-ras in three chromosomes. One marker chromosome was almost entirely encompassed by both amplified genes. In the other cell line, Lu-65, both of the amplified genes shared the same locus, on chromosome 12q+. The two genes, however, are more than 1500 kb apart in both cell lines. The above findings indicate that two different amplified genes became associated on one chromosome in two independent cell lines. This suggests that a common mechanism is associated with chromosomal rearrangements affecting different amplified genes.	0
12667417	Barrett's esophagus and Barrett's carcinoma. The alarming rise in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinomas in the Western world has focused interest on so-called Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is characterized by specialized intestinal epithelium replacing the normal squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus and is considered a consequence of long-lasting and severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. A metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence links Barrett's esophagus with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (Barrett's cancer). Despite intensive research, many questions concerning the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Barrett's esophagus and associated adenocarcinoma are still unanswered. Based on current data, the malignant progression of Barrett's esophagus cannot be substantially prevented by medical or surgical therapy for reflux. Although no firm data are available to show that surveillance strategies can reduce overall mortality from Barrett's cancer, early detection and cure are possible. Management of Barrett's esophagus and carcinoma is reviewed with reference to the sequence of disease from metaplasia to carcinoma.	0
21731323	Outcomes of cataract surgeries over 16 years in camps held by Al basar international foundation in 38 underdeveloped countries. PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes of 16 years of eye campaigns in 38 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study using the Al-Basar International Foundation (BIF) records. BIF is a non-governmental, non-religious philanthropic organization working in the field of the prevention of blindness since 1989. Having its base in Saudi Arabia and working mainly in Asia and Africa. Study variables included the causes of diminished vision, outcomes of eye surgeries, number of camps, patients assessed, surgeries performed, intraocular lenses (IOLs) implanted, spectacles distributed, general outcomes of campaigns, and other variables. RESULTS: Between the periods of November 1989 and June 2006, BIF conducted 620 eye camps. These camps were conducted by ophthalmologists with expertise of working in eye camps with limited resources and harsh environmental conditions. Over two million people were examined and/or treated, and 186, 765 surgeries were performed. Nearly 100,000 IOLs were implanted and more than 140,000 spectacles were prescribed and distributed. The majority of these activities (74%) took place in Asia and the Middle East. The best corrected visual acuity achieved (BCVA) was ranked good (6/6 -6/18) in 59% of patients and borderline (BCVA 6/18 - 6/60) in 35% and poor (BCVA <6/60) in less than 6% of patients based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. CONCLUSION: Quality assured eye campaigns held by BIF helped the most needy countries and people. Intensive volunteer cataract programs and surgeries such as those provided by the BIF add significant support to the efforts of the WHO and International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness in fighting blindness.	0
12967037	Evaluation of the anti-ulcerogenic activity of a dry extract of Maytenus ilicifolia Martius ex. Reiss produced by a jet spouted bed dryer. We undertook the present study to evaluate the activity of the dried extract of Maytenus ilicifolia against stomach ulcers and in the increase of the volume and pH of the gastric juice of Wistar rats, as a model to evaluate the viability of the Jet Spouted Bed Dryer for the production of dry-extracts of medicinal Brazilian plants. The extract was obtained from the drying of a hydro-alcoholic extract with drying aid (40% of colloidal SiO2 related to solid content in the concentrated extract, at a concentration of 15.82% in water). The drying conditions employed were: Temperature of the spouting gas 150 degrees C, feed flow-rate of hydro-alcoholic extract 16.0 g/min, feed flow rate of the spouting gas 1.67 m3/min and static bed height 7.0 cm. Wistar rats received three different doses (140, 280 and 420 mg/kg) of the dried extract by intraperitoneal way and, after 60 minutes, were immobilized with wire screen and placed at temperature of 4 degrees C for two hours (cold-restraint stress). The animals were sacrificed and the stomach removed, examined and the volume and pH of the gastric secretion determined. A significant reduction in the ulceration index, was observed as well as a significant increase of the volume and of the pH of the gastric secretion for all doses administered. This is an indication that the preparation of dried extracts by the Jet spouted bed technique does not alter the biological activity of Maytenus ilicifolia.	0

15126463	Identification of an uptake hydrogenase required for hydrogen-dependent reduction of Fe(III) and other electron acceptors by Geobacter sulfurreducens. Geobacter sulfurreducens, a representative of the family Geobacteraceae that predominates in Fe(III)-reducing subsurface environments, can grow by coupling the oxidation of hydrogen to the reduction of a variety of electron acceptors, including Fe(III), fumarate, and quinones. An examination of the G. sulfurreducens genome revealed two operons, hya and hyb, which appeared to encode periplasmically oriented respiratory uptake hydrogenases. In order to assess the roles of these two enzymes in hydrogen-dependent growth, Hya- and Hyb-deficient mutants were generated by gene replacement. Hyb was found to be required for hydrogen-dependent reduction of Fe(III), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, and fumarate by resting cell suspensions and to be essential for growth with hydrogen and these three electron acceptors. Hya, in contrast, was not. These findings suggest that Hyb is an essential respiratory hydrogenase in G. sulfurreducens.	0
17425293	Laser-induced fluorescence spectrum of 3-vinyl-1H-indene. The laser-induced fluorescence spectrum of 3-vinyl-1H-indene was recorded between 33,000 and 33,800 cm(-1). An origin band was observed at 33,455 cm(-1) along with several low-frequency modes. With the aid of density functional theory and configuration interaction calculations, the electronic transition was assigned as S1 <-- S0 and the short progression in an 80 cm(-1) mode was identified as a vinyl group torsion. Theoretical, spectroscopic, and thermochemical considerations suggest that the 3-vinyl-1H-indene spectrum results from excitation from both conformational isomers with the vinyl and indene double bonds in trans and cis arrangements. The results are discussed in the context of the identification of species arising from the discharge of benzene in argon.	0
24251575	MRSA infections: from classical treatment to suicide drugs. Infections caused by the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are today a major burden in nosocomial disease control. The global trend shows an alarming increase of MRSA infections as well as multi-drug resistance (MDR). The problem is exacerbated by the fact that infections with community-associated (CA) MRSA strains showing increased virulence and fitness add to infections with multi-drug resistant hospital-associated (HA) MRSA. The toxicity of pathogens and limited effectiveness of available treatment have led to high mortality rates and vast expenses caused by prolonged hospitalization and usage of additional antibiotics. Recently approved drugs still have classical targets and upcoming resistance can be expected. In a new approach by targeting co-factor syntheses of bacteria, the drug target and the affected pathways are uncoupled. This novel strategy is based on the thought of a classical pro-drug which has to be metabolized before becoming toxic for the bacterium as a dysfunctional co-factor, named suicide drug. Ideally these metabolizing pathways are solely present in the bacterium and absent in the human host, such as vitamin biosyntheses. This mini-review discusses current ways of MRSA infection treatment using new approaches including suicide drugs targeting co-factor biosyntheses.	0
20622412	Need to establish tobacco smoke zones in public places in Kerala. BACKGROUND: Second-hand smoke is a grave hazard to both smokers and nonsmokers. AIMS: To assess the attitude of general public toward establishing smoke zones in public places. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among people residing in one randomly selected municipality of Kannur district in Kerala state, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1000 individuals participated in the study. An open-ended, semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire, which was pilot tested was used to collect information from people willing to participate in the study. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics was used. Statistical analysis was performed by using PASW 17. RESULTS: 73.1% of the total participants indicated a positive attitude toward establishing smoke zones in public places. All female participants and 69.7% of male participants had positive attitude toward establishing smoke zones in public places. Most nonsmokers (83.2%) showed a positive attitude toward establishing smoke zones. A statistically significant (P < 0.001) association was observed between smoking habit and attitude toward establishing smoke zones in public places. Among males, a statistically significant (P < 0.001) association was observed between age and attitude toward the need for smoke zones. As age increased, the attitude toward establishing tobacco smoke zone in public places was found to become more positive. CONCLUSION: Most of the participants had positive attitude to prohibition of smoking in public places in order to safe guard the public from the harmful effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke.	0
7815932	Phylogenetic inference under the pure drift model. When pairwise genetic distances are used for phylogenetic reconstruction, it is usually assumed that the genetic distance between two taxa contains information about the time after the two taxa diverged. As a result, upon an appropriate transformation if necessary, the distance usually can be fitted to a linear model such that it is expressed as the sum of lengths of all branches that connect the two taxa in a given phylogeny. This kind of distance is referred to as \"additive distance.\" For a phylogenetic tree exclusively driven by random genetic drift, genetic distances related to coancestry coefficients (theta XY) between any two taxa are more suitable. However, these distances are fundamentally different from the additive distance in that coancestry does not contain any information about the time after two taxa split from a common ancestral population; instead, it reflects the time before the two taxa diverged. In other words, the magnitude of theta XY provides information about how long the two taxa share the same evolutionary pathways. The fundamental difference between the two kinds of distances has led to a different algorithm of evaluating phylogenetic trees when theta XY and related distance measures are used. Here we present the new algorithm using the ordinary-least-squares approach but fitting to a different linear model. This treatment allows genetic variation within a taxon to be included in the model. Monte Carlo simulation for a rooted phylogeny of four taxa has verified the efficacy and consistency of the new method. Application of the method to human population was demonstrated.	0

11988749	Taking a bite: proteasomal protein processing. The proteasome is a hollow cylindrical protease that contains active sites concealed within its central cavity. Proteasomes usually completely degrade substrates into small peptides, but in a few cases, degradation can yield biologically active protein fragments. Examples of this are the transcription factors NF-kappa B, Spt23p and Mga2p, which are generated from precursors by proteasomal processing. How distinct protein domains are spared from degradation remains a matter of debate. Here, we discuss several models and suggest a novel mechanism for proteasomal processing.	0

16429793	Simple spectrophotometric flow injection system with an in-valve minicolumn for enhancement during the determination of chromium(III) using EDTA. A simple spectrophotometric flow injection (FI) procedure for the determination of Cr(III) using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was developed. An FI system with a column packed with Amberlite IR-120(H) was employed for sample pretreatment. This leads to the possibility of a single standard calibration. A linear calibration in a range of 10-27 microg Cr(III) was obtained with a detection limit of 1 microg Cr(III) and RSD of 2% (18 microg Cr(III), n=12). The proposed procedure was applied for determination of Cr(III) in leachate and dietary supplement samples. The results agreed with those obtained by the standard methods.	0
21686319	Simultaneous TMS-fMRI of the Visual Cortex Reveals Functional Network, Even in Absence of Phosphene Sensation. Phosphene sensation is commonly used to measure cortical excitability during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the occipital cortex. However, some individuals lack this perception, and the reason for it is still unknown. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to detect brain activation during local TMS of the occipital cortex in twelve healthy subjects. We found that TMS modulated brain activity in areas connected to the stimulation site, even in people unable to see phosphene. However, we observed a trend for a lower blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, and smaller brain-activation clusters near the stimulated site than in the interconnected brain areas, suggesting that TMS pulse is more effective downstream than at its application site. Furthermore, we noted prominent differences in brain activation/deactivation patterns between subjects who perceived phosphene and those who did not, implying a functional distinction in their neuronal networks that might explain the origin of differences in phosphene generation.	0
7869937	Effects of dexfenfluramine on resting metabolic rate and thermogenesis in premenopausal obese women during therapeutic weight reduction. To investigate whether a serotoninergic drug such as dexfenfluramine (dF) may have some beneficial effects on energy expenditure (EE) during therapeutic weight reduction, a 3-month study was conducted in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty-two obese, premenopausal women received either dF or placebo (P) in addition to a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) prescription. All patients started--when hospitalized at the metabolic ward--with a 500-kcal regimen and fulfilled the 3-month trial on a +/- 760-kcal protein-sparing modified fast. Although not statistically significant, women receiving dF lost more weight (16.0 +/- 1.4 v 12.8 +/- 1.3 kg, P = .111) over the 3-month study period. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) decreased significantly by 5% in the dF group (4.79 to 4.53 kJ/min) and by 9% in the P group (5.09 to 4.63 kJ/min). When expressed per kilogram body weight, RMR significantly increased from 0.050 to 0.057 kJ/min/kg in the dF group (P < .001), versus 0.053 to 0.056 in the P group (NS). When expressed per kilogram fat-free mass (FFM), RMR remained stable in the dF group, whereas it significantly decreased in the P group (P = .024). No significant differences could be found between groups. Glucose-induced thermogenesis (GIT), expressed as percent increase above RMR, did not show significant differences between groups. When expressed per kilogram body weight, mean GIT increased in the dF group from 0.14% to 0.16% above RMR, with a significant decrease from 0.15% to 0.13% in the P group. Only during the first hour did GIT per kilogram body weight significantly (P = .038) increase in the dF group during the outpatient period (between day 16 and day 90). These results show that a serotoninergic drug seems capable of limiting the weight reduction-associated decrease in RMR and dietary-induced thermogenesis (DIT), certainly when expressed on a per-kilogram-weight basis.	0

9733123	Performance and tissue zinc and metallothionein accumulation in chicks fed a high dietary level of zinc. Four experiments were conducted to identify several factors that might improve the accuracy and reproducibility of Zn bioavailability assays for chicks. Response of tissue Zn and metallothionein (MT) concentrations to various elevated levels and soluble sources of dietary Zn were measured, as well as the effect of delaying high Zn administration until 7 d posthatching to alleviate the detrimental effect of Zn sulfate on feed intake to 3 wk of age. Bone Zn increased (P < 0.01) in all experiments in response to increasing dietary Zn concentrations. Liver and pancreas MT were affected (P < 0.01) by a source by age interaction and variability that made this criterion unsuitable for bioavailability assays. Lastly, 1-d-old chicks were used to study the effect of delaying feeding of a high-Zn diet up to 7 d of age. The basal diet was fed continuously for 21 d as a control. A diet containing 1,000 ppm Zn was either fed continuously from Day 1, or started on Day 3, 5, or 7. Chicks given high Zn on Day 3, 5, or 7 decreased (P < 0.01) feed intake within 24 h of feeding. Delayed feeding of high dietary Zn might help to alleviate decreased feed intake observed in previous studies. Delaying the onset of high Zn feeding by several days may help alleviate feed intake problems observed with Zn sulfate. Use of either Zn gluconate or Zn acetate as a standard in assays or use of MT synthesis as a bioavailability criterion will probably not be useful to improve accuracy of the estimates.	0

16292979	Characterizing the thermally induced structural changes to intact porcine eye, part 1: second harmonic generation imaging of cornea stroma. We characterize the structural changes of porcine corneal structures from 25 to 90 degrees C using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Our results show that porcine stroma undergoes several distinct stages of structural changes between 25 and 90 degrees C. A decrease in SHG intensity from 30 to 45 degrees C and the existence of SHG intensity peaks at 53, 65, and 77 degrees C correlate to distinct structural alterations of the corneal stroma. At higher temperatures, the SHG intensity decreases and a baseline in SHG signal is reached at 90 degrees C. Our results demonstrate that SHG microscopy is a useful technique for obtaining qualitative and quantitative information of thermally treated corneal fibers without histological or labeling procedures. With additional developments, SHG imaging may be developed into an effective imaging technique for in vivo characterization of cornea structural changes.	0

11841134	Prospective study of brief neuropsychological measures to assess crash risk in older primary care patients. BACKGROUND: Practicing primary care physicians often encounter the difficult clinical situation of evaluating the older driver. We wanted to investigate the relation between self-reported driving behavior, neuropsychological measures, and crash risk to inform the development of a test battery that could predict unsafe driving behavior and was feasible for use by primary care physicians. METHODS: This study was a prospective follow-up of 107 drivers aged 65 years and older recruited from a primary care setting in 1995. Tests of attention, visual information processing, spatial orientation, and general mental status were administered at baseline. At baseline and after 2 years of follow-up, patients were asked about their driving history using the driving questionnaire. Risk for reported crashes in the follow-up period was assessed in relation to baseline driving history and measures of cognition. RESULTS: Baseline self-reports of driving habits and attitudes were associated with an increased risk of reporting a crash after 2 years of follow-up (relative risk ratio = 5.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63, 44.63). In addition, baseline tests of attention, visual information processing, and spatial orientation were associated with an increased risk of reporting motor vehicle crash at follow-up. For example, respondents with poor performance on the Trail Making Test-part A, were almost four times more likely to report a crash at follow-up (risk ratio = 3.15; 95% CI, 0.76, 13.07). CONCLUSION: Although our conclusions are tempered by small sample size, this preliminary study suggests that brief cognitive tests and simple questions about driving habits warrant further investigation as indicators of crash risk with potential utility for assessing older drivers in primary care.	0
15844734	How long do parthenogenetically activated mouse oocytes maintain the ability to accept sperm nuclei as a genetic partner? PURPOSE: Cytogenetic risk of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) after artificial oocyte activation (post-activation ICSI) was evaluated in the mouse. METHODS: Mouse zygotes were produced by ICSI into eggs at various intervals after parthenogenetic exposure to strontium (Sr) for 30 min. Male pronucleus formation and the chromosome constitution were studied. RESULTS: Sperm nuclei injected into oocytes within 1 h after Sr exposure (from early through mid-telophase) transformed normally into male pronuclei, and the number of chromosome aberrations did not significantly increase in the resultant zygotes. When sperm nuclei were injected into eggs at intervals beyond 1 h after Sr exposure (from late telophase through the G1 pronuclear stage), the rate of male pronucleus formation was significantly reduced. The incidence of chromosome aberrations increased with time between oocyte activation and ICSI. CONCLUSIONS: ICSI into oocytes within 1 h after parthenogenetic activation produces cytogenetically competent embryos in the mouse.	0
19932681	cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) positively regulates mouse adiponectin gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Adiponectin is expressed in adipose tissue by adipogenic transcription factors including PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, and ADD1/SREBP1c. Because cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is also a central transcriptional activator of adipocyte differentiation, we evaluated CREB to determine if it stimulates adiponectin gene expression. To accomplish this, we evaluated the effects of activated CREB on the promoter activity of the mouse adiponectin gene, and identified the cAMP-response element (CRE) in the promoter. The constitutively active form of CREB increased the promoter activity of the mouse adiponectin gene. In addition, transfection studies using 5' serial deleted promoters revealed the presence of a putative CRE located between the -1250 and -1000bp region. Furthermore, an electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that CREB bound to the region between -1022 and -995 in the adiponectin promoter. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), which activate CREB, increased the adiponectin promoter activity. However, this stimulation was prevented by the dominant negative form of CREB (ACREB) and pretreatment with PD098059, indicating that IGF-1 stimulate adiponectin expression through CREB phosphorylation via the ERK pathway. Importantly, the transactivation of adiponectin expression by CREB was inhibited by ATF3. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assay revealed that ATF3 bound to CREB and prevented CREB phosphorylation induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CREB is a positive regulator of mouse adiponectin gene expression in adipocytes, which play an important role in the regulation of adiponectin expression in response to growth factor.	1
19209226	Loss of yata, a novel gene regulating the subcellular localization of APPL, induces deterioration of neural tissues and lifespan shortening. BACKGROUND: The subcellular localization of membrane and secreted proteins is finely and dynamically regulated through intracellular vesicular trafficking for permitting various biological processes. Drosophila Amyloid precursor protein like (APPL) and Hikaru genki (HIG) are examples of proteins that show differential subcellular localization among several developmental stages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study of the localization mechanisms of APPL and HIG, we isolated a novel mutant of the gene, CG1973, which we named yata. This molecule interacted genetically with Appl and is structurally similar to mouse NTKL/SCYL1, whose mutation was reported to cause neurodegeneration. yata null mutants showed phenotypes that included developmental abnormalities, progressive eye vacuolization, brain volume reduction, and lifespan shortening. Exogenous expression of Appl or hig in neurons partially rescued the mutant phenotypes of yata. Conversely, the phenotypes were exacerbated in double null mutants for yata and Appl. We also examined the subcellular localization of endogenous APPL and exogenously pulse-induced APPL tagged with FLAG by immunostaining the pupal brain and larval motor neurons in yata mutants. Our data revealed that yata mutants showed impaired subcellular localization of APPL. Finally, yata mutant pupal brains occasionally showed aberrant accumulation of Sec23p, a component of the COPII coat of secretory vesicles traveling from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: We identified a novel gene, yata, which is essential for the normal development and survival of tissues. Loss of yata resulted in the progressive deterioration of the nervous system and premature lethality. Our genetic data showed a functional relationship between yata and Appl. As a candidate mechanism of the abnormalities, we found that yata regulates the subcellular localization of APPL and possibly other proteins.	0

20739424	Coffee consumption and risk of incident gout in women: the Nurses' Health Study. BACKGROUND: Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world and may affect the risk of gout via various mechanisms, but prospective data on the relation between coffee intake and the risk of incident gout are limited. DESIGN: Over a 26-y period, we prospectively examined the relation between coffee intake and risk of incident gout in 89,433 female participants in the Nurses' Health Study. We assessed the consumption of coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, and total caffeine in participants every 2-4 y through validated questionnaires. We used a supplementary questionnaire to ascertain whether participants met the survey criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for gout. RESULTS: During the 26 y of follow-up, we documented 896 confirmed incident cases of gout. There was an inverse association between higher coffee intake and the risk of gout. The multivariate relative risks (RRs) for incident gout according to coffee-consumption categories [ie, 0, 1-237, 238-947, and >= 948 mL coffee/d (237 mL = one 8-ounce cup)] were 1.00, 0.97, 0.78 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.95), and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.61; P for trend < 0.0001), respectively. For decaffeinated coffee, the multivariate RRs according to consumption categories (0, 1-237, and >= 237 mL decaffeinated coffee/d) were 1.00, 1.02, and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.95; P for trend = 0.02), respectively. There was an inverse association between total caffeine from all sources and the risk of gout; the multivariate RR of the highest quintile compared with the lowest quintile was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.68; P for trend <0.0001). CONCLUSION: These prospective data suggest that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of incident gout in women.	0

16734023	Copper (II) ion selective liquid membrane electrode based on new Schiff base carrier. Cu2+ selective PVC membrane electrode based on new Schiff base 2, 2'-[1,9 nonanediyl bis (nitriloethylidyne)]-bis-(1-naphthol) as a selective carrier was constructed. The electrode exhibited a linear potential response within the activity range of 1.0 x 10(-6) - 5.0 x 10(-3) moll(-1) with a Nernstian slope of 29 +/- 1 mV decade(-1) of Cu2+ activity and a limit of detection 8.0 x 10(-7) mol l(-1). The response time of the electrode was fast, 10 s, and stable potentials were obtained within the pH range of 3.5- 6.5. The potentiometric selectivity coefficients were evaluated using two solution method and revealed no important interferences except for Ag+ ion. The proposed electrode was applied as an indicator electrode to potentiometric titration of Cu2+ ions and determination of Cu2+ content in real samples such as black tea leaves and multivitamin capsule.	0

16024752	Estrogen: a neuroprotective or proinflammatory hormone? Emerging evidence from reproductive aging models. Estrogen or hormone (estrogen + progestin) replacement is typically prescribed to women for relief from vasomotor symptoms at menopause. Observational studies have shown that such replacement also decreases the risk for Alzheimer's disease. Experimental data from a variety of animal models also suggest that estrogen replacement given to ovariectomized animals is largely neuroprotective. However, the recent intervention trial (Women's Health Initiative Memory Study; WHIMS) concluded that estrogen replacement and hormone replacement prescribed to postmenopausal women increased the risk for global cognitive impairment and dementia, respectively. This paper will examine evidence that the disparity in the human and animal data can be reconciled by consideration of the \"reproductive\" age of the individual receiving estrogen or hormone replacement. Our recent studies comparing the effects of estrogen replacement on young adult animals with those of estrogen replacement to reproductive senescent animals suggest that the estrogen replacement is beneficial when given to \"surgically menopausal\" (ovariectomized) animals. However, estrogen replacement appears to be deleterious to acyclic reproductive senescent animals, where target organs such as the brain have been in a prolonged estrogen-deficient state. The paper will also review aging and reproductive age-related changes in the estrogen receptor (ER) systems, specifically ER-alpha, as a potential mechanism for estrogen's deleterious effects in the reproductive senescent animal.	0

16397390	Establishment and characterization of eight feline mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines. Eight new feline mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from either primary or metastatic lesions were established. The morphology of all the cell lines was epithelioid and round to spindle in shape, with cell growth occurring in a monolayer fashion. On immunohistochemistry, these cells reacted with anti-keratin and anti-vimentin antisera. The doubling time of these cells was between 19 and 54 hr. Tumor masses were developed in nude mice by subcutaneous inoculation of the cells that were histologically identical to their original mammary tumor lesions. Telomerase activities measured using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay revealed high telemetric activity in all of the cells.	0
9486499	Cadaveric bone marrow and spleen cells for transplantation. Cadaveric bone marrow was harvested from 20 brain-dead donors to determine optimal conditions for procurement for transplantation. The number of nucleated cells obtained from 1 ml of bone marrow was significantly higher in vertebrae (87+/-20 x 10(6), mean +/- s.e.m.) than in the sternum (10.2+/-3.8 x 10[6]) or ribs (4.9+/-2.0 x 10[6]). Viability of cells was not significantly affected by storage temperature (4 degrees C or 20 degrees C) or duration of storage (6-72 h). In addition to bone marrow, spleen cells were harvested from three cadaveric donors. The mean yield from 1 g of spleen tissue was 4.4 x 10(6) nucleated cells. Using magnetic beads, we removed 96% of T lymphocytes without affecting the total yield of stem cells from cadaveric bone marrow. Using CD34-positive cell selection, we obtained a 99.6% T cell depletion efficiency, but with a loss of 60% of CD34-positive cells. Using optimized techniques, we obtained an estimated mean yield of 5.5 x 10(10) mononuclear cells from the whole thoracic and lumbar vertebral column. With a mean fraction of CD34-positive cells of 2.1+/-0.3%, recovery and purity were not affected by site of sample, temperature or donor age. In contrast, the CD34-positive fraction in spleen preparations was 0.41+/-0.06%. When analyzing the number of colony-forming units (CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM), we found no significant differences between cadaveric bone marrow and bone marrow aspirates from living donors. However, cells harvested from the spleen gave significantly fewer CFUs than did bone marrow from living donors. We conclude that bone marrow from cadaveric donors can be harvested and procured with a high degree of viability and good function. With an appropriate technique of harvesting and procurement, it seems feasible to recover enough stem cells for transplantation.	0

Fluoride concentration of fissure enamel from unerupted third molars was higher than that of the cervical-lingual but not cervical-buccal surfaces at a similar depth of the removed enamel. The highest fluoride concentration was found in the fissure enamel due probably to its earlier formation, higher permeability and embedding tissue before eruption.	0
16384788	Development of a fed-batch culture process for enhanced production of recombinant human antithrombin by Chinese hamster ovary cells. Antithrombin is a serine protease inhibitor that inactivates several coagulation proteases, primarily thrombin and factor Xa. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line transfected with a vector expressing recombinant human antithrombin (rAT) and a selectable marker, glutamine synthetase (GS), was cultivated in a 2-l fed-batch culture process using serum-free, glutamine-free medium. To maximize the rAT yield, effects of culture pH, balanced amino acid feeding, and an increased glutamate concentration on cell metabolism and rAT production were investigated. When cells were grown at pH values of 6.6, 6.8, 7.0, and 7.2, the maximum cell density and maximum lactate concentration decreased with decreasing pH. The highest production level of rAT was obtained at culture pH 6.8 due to the extended culture lifetime. Compared to the imbalanced amino acid feeding at culture pH 6.8, the balanced amino acid feeding increased the amount of rAT activity by 30% as a result of an increased viable cell number. A decrease in the specific glucose consumption rate (q(Glc)) with increasing culture time was observed in all the above-mentioned experiments, while the glucose concentration was maintained above 0.7 g l(-1). In addition, a decrease in the specific rAT production rate (q(rAT)) was observed after the depletion of lactate in the late cultivation stage. Taken together, these results suggest that the reduced availability of cellular energy caused by the decrease in q(Glc) and depletion of lactate led to the decrease in q(rAT). This decrease in q(rAT) was partially prevented by increasing the residual glutamate concentration from 1 mM to 7 mM, thus resulting in an additional 30% increase in the amount of rAT activity. The optimized fed-batch culture process yielded 1.0 g l(-1) rAT at 287 h of cultivation.	0
18699820	Resident response to integration of simulation-based education into emergency medicine conference. OBJECTIVES: Utilization of simulation-based training has become increasingly prevalent in residency training. The authors compared emergency medicine (EM) resident feedback for simulation sessions to traditional lectures from an EM residency didactic program. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of all written EM conference evaluations over a 29-month period. Evaluation questions were scored on a 1-9 Likert scale. RESULTS: Lectures and simulation accounted for 77.6 and 22.4% of the conferences, respectively. Scored means (+/-standard deviations [SDs]) were as follows: overall, lecture 7.97 +/- 0.74 versus simulation 8.373 +/- 0.44 (p < 0.01); Question 1, lecture 7.97 +/- 0.74 versus simulation 8.40 +/- 0.43 (p < 0.005); Question 2, lecture 7.92 +/- 0.74 versus simulation 8.34 +/- 0.48 (p < 0.01); Question 3, lecture 8.01 +/- 0.77 versus simulation 8.26 +/- 0.51 (p < 0.15); and Question 4, lecture 8.00 +/- 0.75 versus simulation 8.42 +/- 0.46 (p < 0.01). There was no longitudinal decay of scores. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency medicine residents scored simulation-based sessions higher than traditional lectures. The scores over time suggest that this preference for simulation can be sustainable long term. Residents perceive simulation as more desirable teaching method compared to the traditional lecture format.	0

10728623	Reactive oxygen species in the process of labor. Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), an indicative parameter for oxidative damage, were measured in maternal and cord arterial and venous bloods, and compared between abdominal and vaginal deliveries. Spontaneous labor resulting in either vaginal or emergency abdominal deliveries was associated with a statistically significant higher levels of TBARS in cord artery compared to cord vein and maternal blood (p<0.05). The results support a role of reactive oxygen species in the initiation of labor, possibly through their effect on prostaglandin metabolism. Alternatively, this may be a marker of fetal oxidative stress, secondary to the process of labor.	0
17671917	[Borderline personality disorder and transsexualism]. OBJECTIVE: The study addresses the question whether, as often assumed, the symptoms of borderline personality disorders occur more frequently in transsexuals or not. METHODS: We examined 164 transsexuals. The subjects completed the following questionnaires: The Borderline-Personality Inventory (BPI), the Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI) and the Questionnaire for Assessment of One's Own Body (FbeK). RESULTS: In 80 % of all the examined transsexuals, there was evidence of symptoms of neither a borderline personality disorder nor of other personality disorders. If borderline symptoms occurred, they were predictable from the variables depressivity, low composure, low sociability and lack of confidence in relation to the external appearance. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained refute the often-assumed increased relationship between borderline personality disorders and transsexuality. It should be assumed that a borderline personality disorder is primarily a psychiatric illness, while transsexuality is a disorder of gender identity in which secondary borderline symptoms may arise in some cases.	0

20170567	[Transverse testicular ectopia confirmed by ultrasonography]. Two newborn boys aged 2 and 3 months with unilateral inguinal hernia and a contralateral impalpable, non-scrotal testis, and a third boy aged 2.5 years with an impalpable non-scrotal testis were found to have transverse testicular ectopia. This is an uncommon abnormality in which both gonads migrate toward the same hemiscrotum. We illustrate that unilateral cryptorchidism and a contralateral inguinal hernia may indicate the presence of a rare type of male pseudohermaphroditism: persistent m  llerian duct syndrome (PMDS). This syndrome is characterized by the presence of a uterus and fallopian tubes associated with abdominal testes and frequently inguinal hernia in a phenotypically and genotypically normal male. This syndrome is often discovered during repair of inguinal hernia or non-descended testes (cryptorchidism). Pre-operative ultrasonography in children with impalpable non-scrotal testis and a contralateral inguinal hernia (patent processus vaginalis) may enable an early diagnosis of transverse testicular ectopia and proper surgical planning. Surgical orchidopexy was carried out and in the first two patients resection of the m  llerian duct remnant (utriculus masculinus).	0
10390189	Hematopoietic dynamics in grey collies. Using Lomb periodogram analysis we have quantified variations in the peripheral neutrophil and platelet counts of the cyclical neutropenia animal model-the grey collie. We found that the amplitudes of the oscillations in these two cell lineages vary concomitantly. Further, the power spectrum and the shape of the oscillations in the absolute neutrophil counts vary together with the amplitude of the oscillations. As the amplitude of the oscillations increases, the height of the second subharmonic increases, giving rise to a distorted oscillation with two peaks per cycle. The particular dynamics of the absolute neutrophil counts can be reproduced by a combination of a delayed peripheral feedback, representing the peripheral control of granulopoiesis through granulocyte colony stimulating factor, together with a sinusoidal input representing an oscillatory input from the pluripotential stem cells to the granulocytic lineage. The same pluripotential stem cell input is probably responsible for the sinusoidal oscillations observed in the other cell lineages.	0
16843597	Capsaicin-evoked brain activation and central sensitization in anaesthetised rats: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) haemodynamic responses was used to study the effects of the noxious substance capsaicin on whole brain activation in isofluorane anaesthetised rats. Rats (n=8) received intradermal injection of capsaicin (30 microg/5 microl), or topical cream (0.1%) capsaicin and BOLD responses were acquired for up to 120 min. Effects of capsaicin versus placebo cream treatment on the BOLD response to a 15 g mechanical stimulus applied adjacent to the site of cream application were also studied. Both injection and cream application of capsaicin activated brain areas involved in pain processing, including the thalamus and periaqueductal grey (PAG) (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Capsaicin also produced increases in BOLD signal intensity in other regions that contribute to pain processing, such as the parabrachial nucleus and superior colliculus. Mechanical stimulation in capsaicin-treated rats, but not placebo-treated rats, induced a significant decrease in BOLD signal intensity in the PAG (p<0.001). These data demonstrate that the noxious substance capsaicin produces brain activation in the midbrain regions and reveals the importance of the PAG in central sensitization.	0

19034653	Effect of N-acetylcysteine on the murine model of colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate through up-regulating PON1 activity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increased in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and have been implicated as mediators of intestinal inflammation. We investigated the hypothesis that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as a glutathione (GSH) precursor attenuates disease progression in a murine dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model. A colitis model was induced by adding 5% DSS into the drinking water for 7 days. BALB/c mice were injiciatur enema with saline, 5-ASA, N-acetylcysteine, respectively, and free drinking water as control group. DSS-treated mice developed severe colitis as shown by bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and pathologic involvement. Colon lengths were significantly decreased in DSS-treated mice with decreased GSH activity too (P < 0.01). ROS in the colon, the level of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) in colonic mucosa, serum tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha), MPO, and MDA were significantly increased in DSS-treated animals (P < 0.01), with decreased PON1 activity (P < 0.01). However, NAC significantly decreased colonic MPO activity, ROS, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels and increased PON1 activity and GSH concentration. Moreover, NAC attenuated the macroscopic colonic damage and the histopathologic changes-induced by DSS while similar to 5-ASA group. These results suggest that NAC may be effective in the treatment of colitis through its up-regulating PON1 and scavenging oxygen-derived free radicals.	0
15958146	Safe motherhood in Jamaica: from slavery to self-determination. The development of maternal health care in Jamaica is reviewed by examining government documents and publications to identify social and political factors associated with maternal mortality decline. Modern maternity services began with the 1887 establishment of the Victoria Jubilee Hospital and Midwifery School. Community midwives were deployed widely by the 1930s and community antenatal care expanded in the 1950s. Social policies in the 1970s increased women's access to primary health care, education and social support; improved transportation in the 1990s facilitated hospital delivery. Maternal mortality declined rapidly from approximately 600/100 000 in the 1930s to 200/100 000 in 1960, led by a 69% decline in sepsis by 1950, and a 72% decline from all causes thereafter, settling at approximately 100/100 000 in the 1980s. Skilled birth attendant deliveries moved from 39% in 1950 to 95% in 2001 and hospital births from 31% in 1960 to 91% in 2001. Maternal mortality plateaued at 70-80% prevalence of skilled delivery care. Deployment of midwives into rural communities and social development focused on women and children were associated with the observed improvements. Further reductions will require greater attention to the quality of emergency obstetric care.	0
8942844	Patient satisfaction with collaborative practice. OBJECTIVE: To gather information on women's perceptions of the services delivered in collaborative obstetrics and gynecology practices and to determine whether patients perceive a difference in the delivery of services in a variety of practice settings. METHODS: A cross-sectional patient satisfaction survey was developed by the Collaborative Practice Advisory Group of ACOG. Ten collaborative practices were selected to participate: five in private offices, two in clinics, two in health maintenance organizations, and one in the military. Between April 15 and May 15, 1994, 3257 completed surveys were obtained for analysis. RESULTS: Between 71% and 92% of women, depending upon the practice setting, agreed with statements regarding the possible benefits from being cared for in a collaborative practice. The majority (75-92%) expected services provided in a collaborative practice to differ from those provided in a noncollaborative practice. Women making their first visit to a collaborative practice expected quicker appointments, more time with the provider, more health information, and more specific diet information than did women who had previously been seen in such a practice. There were minimal differences in comfort levels when discussing issues of sexuality and physical and sexual abuse in either public or private settings with physicians or non-physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this survey were accepting of the concept of collaborative practice and felt that it offered quicker appointments, more time with the provider, more health information, and more specific diet information than did physician-only practices.	0

21371287	Risk factors for diabetic retinopathy in a rural Chinese population with type 2 diabetes: the Handan Eye Study. PURPOSE: To describe risk factors associated with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a population-based sample of rural Chinese with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The Handan Eye Study is a population-based cross-sectional study surveyed 6830 Chinese people aged 30+ years from 13 randomly selected villages in 2006-2007. All participants underwent a standardized interview and extensive examinations including ophthalmologic and systemic conditions. Diabetic retinopathy was graded from fundus photographs according to the modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study classification system. Logistic regression models were used to assess risk factors associated with DR. RESULTS: Of 7577 eligible persons, 6830 (90.4%) participated, of which 5597 (81.9%) had fasting plasma glucose (FPG) data. There were 387 (6.9%) participants with diabetes, and 368 (95.1%) had gradable fundus photographs. The age-standardized prevalence of DR was 43.1%. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models for all diabetic participants, independent risk factors for DR were longer duration of diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.94, 4.85, per 5 years of duration), higher FPG levels (OR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.27, per mmol/l increase) and higher systolic blood pressure (OR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.37, per 10 mmHg increase). For newly diagnosed diabetes, the only significant factor of DR was higher FPG levels (OR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.29, per mmol/l increase). CONCLUSIONS: In rural Chinese persons with diabetes, longer diabetes duration, hyperglycaemia and elevated blood pressure are risk factors for DR. These findings underscore the importance of controlling classic risk factors for DR in developing countries, where diabetes prevalence is increasing.	0

24413591	Identification of rye chromosomes: the Giemsa banding pattern and the translocation tester set. The Giemsa banding pattern is given for eleven reciprocal translocations of rye, Secale cereale L., together involving all chromosomes at least once, and one telocentric substitution. It is possible to correlate the identification system based on the Giemsa pattern with that based on the translocation tester set. The location of the translocation break points could be determined very exactly for a number of translocations, somewhat less exactly for others. The variations in the banding pattern, resulting from genetic, environmental and technical variation, make definite identification with the nomenclature system of the different rye additions to wheat difficult. An attempt is made, but some caution is necessary.	0

10456796	Dissociation between autonomic responding and verbal report in right and left hemisphere brain damage during anticipatory anxiety. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between peripheral autonomic arousal and emotional experience. BACKGROUND: Several theories of emotional experience suggest that this experience is, at least in part, related to feedback from the viscera and the autonomic nervous system. METHOD: To partially test this hypothesis and to learn if there are hemispheric asymmetries of emotional experience, we studied skin conductance responses (SCR) and verbal report in patients with right hemisphere damage (RHD), patients with left hemisphere damage (LHD), and normal control subjects during the anticipation of electric shocks. RESULTS: During the shock condition, RHD and LHD subjects had smaller SCRs than did normal control subjects. Verbal report measures, however, revealed that subjects reported feeling less pleasant, more aroused, and less in control during the shock condition compared to the no-shock condition. Unlike the SCR results, the verbal report of emotional experience did not differ between the patients with RHD, patients with LHD, and normal control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional experience is not dependent upon activation of and feedback from the autonomic nervous system.	0
23657965	Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and CC chemokine receptor 2 polymorphisms and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and its receptor CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) play a major role in inflammation and proliferation of cancers. We investigated a possible association between polymorphisms in MCP-1 and CCR2 genes (MCP-1 -2518A/G and CCR2 190G/A or V64I) and the risk as well as prognosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 416 RCC cases and 458 age-matched healthy controls. Frequency of MCP-1 2518GG genotype for cases and controls was 0.384 and 0.286, respectively; individuals carrying the GG genotype had a 1.89-fold increased risk of RCC than those with AA genotype (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.24-2.81, p = 0.002; data were adjusted for age and sex). Frequency of CCR2 190AA (64I/64I) genotype for cases and controls was 0.175 and 0.076, respectively; subjects having AA genotype had a 2.68-fold increased risk of RCC compared to those with the wild-type GG genotype (95 %CI 1.71-4.17, p = 4.3 * 10(-6); data were adjusted for age and sex). When analyzing the survival rate of RCC, patients with MCP-1 -2518GG genotype revealed significantly shorter survival time compared to cases with MCP-1 -2518AA and AG genotypes (p = 0.003). Similarly, RCC cases carrying CCR2 190AA genotype showed significantly shorter survival rate than patients with GG or GA genotypes (p < 0.001). These data suggested that MCP-1 -2518A/G and CCR2 190G/A polymorphisms are new risk factors for RCC and could be used as prognostic markers for this malignancy.	0
8957246	Competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, CGP 40116, substitutes for the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. A drug discrimination procedure was used to compare the ability of competitive (CGP 37849, D,L-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentanoate; CGP 40116, D-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentanoate) and non-competitive (dizocilpine) NMDA receptor antagonists to substitute for ethanol in rats trained to discriminate between a 1.0 g/kg dose of ethanol (i.p.) and saline. Dizocilpine (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) substituted partially for ethanol at doses that markedly reduced the rate of responding. CGP 37849 (1.25-5.0 mg/kg) substituted partially for ethanol and suppressed the response rate. CGP 40116 (0.5-2.5 mg/kg), and active D-stereoisomer of CGP 37849, completely substituted (88%) for ethanol, and caused only moderate suppression of the response rate.	0

14559998	Modulation of retinoid signaling by a cytoplasmic viral protein via sequestration of Sp110b, a potent transcriptional corepressor of retinoic acid receptor, from the nucleus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein (core) plays a significant role in the development of chronic liver diseases caused by HCV infection. We have discovered that the core sensitized all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells. Activation of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha)-mediated transcription by the core was also seen in all the cell lines tested. By use of a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified Sp110b as a candidate for a core-interacting cellular factor. Although the function of Sp110b has remained unknown, we observed that Sp110b interacts with RARalpha and suppresses RARalpha-mediated transcription. These data suggest that Sp110b is a transcriptional cofactor negatively regulating RARalpha-mediated transcription. RNA interference-mediated reduction of endogenous Sp110b levels depressed the ability of the core to activate RARalpha-mediated transcription, suggesting an essential role for Sp110b in this pathway. The normal nuclear subcellular localization of Sp110b was altered by molecular interaction with the core to the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. This evidence suggests a model in which the core sequesters Sp110b from the nucleus and inactivates its corepressor function to activate RARalpha-mediated transcription. These findings likely describe a novel system in which a cytoplasmic viral protein regulates host cell transcription.	1

16318182	Power-efficient dual-rate optical transceiver. A dual-rate (2 Gbit/s and 100 Mbit/s) optical transceiver designed for power-efficient connections within and between modern high-speed digital systems is described. The transceiver can dynamically adjust its data rate according to performance requirements, allowing for power-on-demand operation. Dynamic power management permits energy saving and lowers device operating temperatures, improving the reliability and lifetime of optoelectronic-devices such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). To implement dual-rate functionality, we include in the transmitter and receiver circuits separate high-speed and low-power data path modules. The high-speed module is designed for gigabit operation to achieve high bandwidth. A simpler low-power module is designed for megabit data transmission with low power consumption. The transceiver is fabricated in a 0.5 microm silicon-on-sapphire complementary metal-oxide semiconductor. The VCSEL and photodetector devices are attached to the transceiver's integrated circuit by flip-chip bonding. A free-space optical link system is constructed to demonstrate correct dual-rate functionality. Experimental results show reliable link operation at 2 Gbit/s and 100 Mbit/s data transfer rates with approximately 104 and approximately 9 mW power consumption, respectively. The transceiver's switching time between these two data rates is demonstrated as 10 micros, which is limited by on-chip register reconfiguration time. Improvement of this switching time can be obtained by use of dedicated input-output pads for dual-rate control signals.	0
20472997	Current progress in blood purification methods used in critical care medicine. The prognosis of patients with an acute accumulation of pathogenic or toxic substances in their body fluids--a condition that severely affects survival--can be significantly improved by blood purification. The most appropriate blood purification method and the duration for which it should be used must be selected on the basis of efficacy and cost. Several blood purification techniques--such as hemodialysis (HD), hemofiltration (HF), hemodiafiltration, continuous hemofiltration (CHF), hemadsorption and plasma exchange--have been developed. Each modality has different removal capacities and limitations; therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly evaluate the time and the duration of use in the case of different disease conditions. The survival rate of patients treated with HF with 35 ml/min of average filtrate is higher than that observed after conventional HD. In patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, proinflammatory cytokines should be removed by HF or CHF, as should the toxins accumulated in the original disease. Thus far, no ideal filter has been developed for the removal of a considerable amount of proinflammatory cytokines with minimal albumin loss. In the case of acute liver failure, ammonia, amino acid metabolites and albumin-binding bilirubin should be removed by a combination of HF and plasma exchange. The use of fresh frozen plasma as a replacement fluid in plasma exchange is also important in order to replenish the deficient coagulation factors and essential metabolic factors. Activation of tissue/organ regeneration by the removal of pathogenic factors or by the substitution of factors essential for regeneration might be important in the case of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In critically ill patients with composite conditions, the use of more than two blood purification techniques at the same time or at different times during the course of the diseases can improve patient prognosis more than the use of single methods.	0

15005851	Converse relationship between in vitro osteogenic differentiation and in vivo bone healing elicited by different populations of muscle-derived cells genetically engineered to express BMP4. In this study, we compared the use of primary muscle-derived osteoprogenitor cells (PP6 cells) for the delivery of BMP4 to improve bone healing to that of muscle-derived non-osteoprogenitor cells (PP1 cells). Surprisingly, the use of PP1 cells resulted in an improved outcome because of the lack of adverse responses to BMP4 involving cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. INTRODUCTION: Although researchers frequently opt to use osteogenic cells for osteogenic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-based ex vivo gene therapy to improve bone healing, it remains unclear whether the osteogenic potential of a cellular vehicle affects the outcome of bone healing applications. Here we compared the use of muscle-derived non-osteoprogenitor cells (PP1 cells) to that of primary muscle-derived osteoprogenitor cells (PP6 cells) for the delivery of BMP4 to improve the healing of bone defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two distinct populations of primary rat muscle-derived cells--PP1 and PP6--were selected, transduced with retroviral vectors to express BMP4 or a marker gene (LacZ), and implanted into critical-sized calvarial defects created in syngeneic rats. The bone healing was monitored radiographically and histologically at 7 and 14 weeks after implantation. Cellular responses to BMP4 were evaluated by alkaline phosphatase histochemical staining and RT-PCR of another osteogenic marker to indicate osteogenic differentiation, a cell proliferation assay and BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) labeling to assess cell proliferation, and the TUNEL assay to determine apoptosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In all animals (nine rats per group), transduced PP1 cells expressing BMP4 demonstrated significantly advanced healing compared with PP6 cells expressing BMP4 and control cells expressing LacZ. We found that constitutive BMP4 expression negatively impacted the in vitro proliferation and in vivo survival rates of PP6 cells, but not PP1 cells. BMP4 exposure also directly inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of PP6 cells, but not PP1 cells. The impairment in PP6 cell proliferation was directly associated with the osteogenic differentiation of these cells. These results indicate that PP1 cells are better suited than osteoprogenitor cells for use as cellular vehicles to deliver osteogenic BMP4 to improve bone healing and that cellular behavior in response to a particular gene can be used to predict the cells' performance as delivery vehicles in ex vivo gene therapy.	0
12559959	OTX2 regulates expression of DOPAchrome tautomerase in human retinal pigment epithelium. Otx2 is a member of homeodomain-containing transcription factors and is essential for eye morphogenesis in mice. Here we show the expression of OTX2, the human counterpart of Otx2, in cell lines of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and in Y79 retinoblastoma cells that exhibit the property of presumptive RPE. These RPE cells express DOPAchrome tautomerase (DCT) that is an enzyme involved in melanin biosynthesis. DCT may contribute to the homeostasis of RPE by detoxifying DOPA-derived metabolites. OTX2 binds to the DCT gene promoter in vivo, as judged by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, repression of endogenous OTX2 expression in Y79 cells by an anti-sense OTX2 oligonucleotide resulted in the decrease of DCT protein contents. Transient expression assays revealed that OTX2 activated the DCT gene promoter through the OTX-2-binding site in an RPE-specific manner. Therefore, OTX2 may regulate RPE-specific target genes, such as DCT, thereby maintaining the homeostasis of RPE.	1

17517102	Human bronchial epithelial cells express an active and inducible biosynthetic pathway for leukotrienes B4 and C4. BACKGROUND: Human bronchial epithelial cells synthesize cyclooxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase products, but the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway that generates the leukotriene (LT) family of bronchoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory mediators is thought to be restricted to leucocytes. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) express a complete and active 5-LO pathway for the synthesis of LTB4 and LTC4, either constitutively or after stimulation. METHODS: Flow cytometry, RT-PCR, Western blotting, enzyme immunoassays and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography were used to investigate constitutive and stimulated expression of 5-LO pathway enzymes and the synthesis of LTs B4 and C4 in primary HBECs and in the 16-HBE 14o- cell line. RESULTS: Constitutive mRNA and protein expression for 5-LO, 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP), LTA4 hydrolase and LTC4 synthase were demonstrated in primary HBECs and in the 16-HBE 14o- cell line. In 16-HBE 14o- cells, treatment with calcium ionophore A23187, bradykinin or LPS up-regulated the expression of these enzymes. The up-regulation of 5-LO was blocked by the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Human bronchial epithelial cells were shown to generate bioactive LTs, with primary HBECs generating 11-fold more LTC4 and five-fold more LTB4 than 16-HBE 14o- cells. LT production was enhanced by ionophore treatment and blocked by the FLAP inhibitor MK-886. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of an active and inducible 5-LO pathway in HBEC suggests that damaged or inflamed bronchial epithelium may synthesize LTs that contribute directly to bronchoconstriction and leucocytosis in airway inflammation.	0
20008807	Use of dietary thyroxine as an alternate molting procedure in spent turkey breeder hens. In the turkey industry, molting is traditionally achieved by reducing photoperiod and withdrawing feed and water for several days. Although it is the most effective method, this practice is discouraged in Canada and alternative strategies need to be established. Thyroid hormone levels naturally change during molt, and dietary thyroxine (T4) supplementation was previously shown to induce molt in chickens. This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of supplemental dietary T4 in inducing molt in spent turkey breeder hens. One hundred twenty 75-wk-old hens were randomly divided into 4 groups (5 floor pens/replicates, 5 hens each) with the control group kept under a 14-h photoperiod and fed a breeder's diet throughout, whereas hens from the 3 other groups were supplemented with 40 ppm (45.76 mg/kg) T4 for 10 d. One treatment group was maintained under 14 h of light and fed a breeder's diet, whereas the 2 others were subjected to a drop in photoperiod to 6 h during or after supplementation and then were fed a maintenance diet. Egg production, feed intake, BW, molt, and plasma levels of T4, prolactin, and luteinizing hormone were measured. All treated hens ceased laying by d 20; however, several individuals spontaneously returned to lay when left on 14 h of light, suggesting incomplete involution of the reproductive tract. Supplementation significantly reduced feed consumption and induced rapid BW loss. All hens returned to their initial weight by the end of the experiment. Most treated hens initiated molt by d 8 of supplementation and all completed molt by d 37. Plasma T4 in treated hens increased significantly by d 3 (P < 0.05) and remained significantly higher than in controls until d 9 (P < 0.01). Levels returned to initial values by d 35. Prolactin levels did not appear to be influenced by T4 but were mainly dependent on photoperiod and reproductive stage, whereas luteinizing hormone levels remained low throughout. In summary, dietary supplementation with 40 ppm (45.76 mg/kg) T4 was successful in inducing molt in turkey breeder hens. However, dropping the photoperiod was necessary to completely reset the reproductive system.	0
7630513	[Fetal macrosomia and mode of delivery]. During the period 1988-1993 the route of delivery in 482 infants with birth weight > or = 4000 grams was studied. Normal vaginal delivery occurred in 396 (82.1%) cases, vacuum extractor in 8 (1.6%) cases and caesarean section in 78 (16.1) cases. Elective induction of labor with oxytocin and/or amniotomy was carried out in 25 cases of macrosomia. Perinatal death and shoulder dystocia never occurred in these macrosomic babies, but clavicles abruption (27 cases), cephalohaematoma (2 cases), shoulder-bladehaematoma (1 case) and birth brachial palsy (1 case) were observed. Because, in our experience, elective induction of labor increased the operative delivery rate (caesarean section, vacuum extractor), we conclude that mothers with macrosomic fetuses can safely be managed expectantly unless there is a indication for induction or caesarean section.	0
20730423	Staging of uterine cervical carcinoma: whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical value of magnetic resonance whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (WB-DWI) in the staging of uterine cervical carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients with untreated uterine cervical carcinoma received preoperative conventional MR and WB-DWI scans. WB-DWI scans were also obtained in 30 healthy volunteers. Measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were made on scans of normal uterine cervix and uterine cervical carcinoma, and benign and metastatic lymph nodes. Statistical analysis was applied to the obtained data. RESULTS: Mean ADC value of uterine cervical carcinoma was significantly lower than the 3 layers of normal uterine cervix (P = 0.00). When an ADC value of 1.28   10(-3) mm(2)/s is used as the threshold, its sensitivity is 96%, specificity is 100%, and accuracy is 98%. Mean ADC value of metastatic nodes [(0.96    0.14)   10(-3) mm(2)/s] was significantly lower than that of benign nodes [(1.39    0.19)   10(-3) mm(2)/s] (t = 9.93, P = 0.00). When an ADC value of 1.14   10(-3) mm(2)/s is used as the threshold, its sensitivity is 83%, specificity is 98%, and accuracy is 94%. CONCLUSION: WB-DWI scan is capable of distinguishing uterine cervical carcinoma from normal uterine cervix, and is capable of separating metastatic nodes from benign nodes.	0

23977948	Preparation of three-dimensional graphene oxide-polyethylenimine porous materials as dye and gas adsorbents. We report a facile method for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) porous materials via the interaction between graphene oxide (GO) sheets and polyethylenimine (PEI) with high amine density at room temperature under atmospheric pressure without stirring. The structural and physical properties of GO-PEI porous materials (GEPMs) are investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement and their chemical properties are analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. GEPMs possess low density and hierarchical morphology with large specific surface area, and big pore volume. Furthermore, the as-prepared 3D porous materials show an excellent adsorption capacity for acidic dyes on the basis of the pore-rich and amine-rich graphene structure. GEPMs exhibit an extremely high adsorption capacity for amaranth (800 mg g(-1)), which are superior to other carbon materials. In addition, GEPMs also exhibit good adsorption capacity for carbon dioxide (11.2 wt % at 1.0 bar and 273 K).	0
8033753	[Establishment and characterization of a SV40 transformed human fetal gastric epithelial cell line-GES-1]. 9 month human fetal gastric epithelial cells were primarily cultured and infected with SV40 virus. About 3 weeks after infection the transformed-like cells showed up and were isolated when most of the normal cells senesced. One transformed clone named GES-1 were analyzed biologically. The results indicated integration of the SV40 T gene and its expression in the cell nuclei and the cells became hyperploid in chromosomes. This cells also maintained a normal cytoskeleton, positive in PAS reaction and were non-tumorigenic in nude mice. The established cell line may be served as an important model system in study of human gastric carcinogenesis.	0

Palladium chloride-catalyzed intramolecular activation of electroneutral cyclopropane derivatives results in cleavage of the cyclopropane ring followed by formation of heterocyclic derivatives. Phenols, carboxylic acids, and amide groups were considered as substituents ortho to the cyclopropane ring in this catalytic activation chemistry. The regioselectivity observed in the case of amide-containing substrates was different from that of carboxylic acid-containing substrates, ruling out simple cyclopropane isomerization followed by a Wacker oxidation as the mechanistic pathway.

9440065	Doppler energy: a new acquisition technique for the transthoracic detection of myocardial perfusion defects with the use of a venous contrast agent. AIMS: This animal experiment was designed to study whether the new technique of Doppler energy imaging could display myocardial perfusion abnormalities with the use of a combination of transthoracic imaging and right atrial injection of a myocardial contrast agent. METHODS AND RESULTS: A series of 11 pigs were studied during (1) normal perfusion, (2) dipyridamole-induced coronary dilatation, and (3) during and after temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending or circumflex artery after a right atrial injection of 8 ml Levovist, 400 mg/ml. Short-axis views were obtained with the four following imaging modes: gray scale imaging (two-dimensional and M-mode), Doppler energy imaging (two-dimensional and M-mode). Visual inspection and off-line video densitometry (results expressed in arbitrary videointensity units 0 to 255) with digital background subtraction were performed. Doppler energy was significantly more sensitive in detecting the presence of contrast than gray scale imaging (background subtracted peak videointensity 32 +/- 17 versus 17 +/- 12, p < 0.001). Mean background-subtracted videointensity increased during dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia (40 +/- 14 versus 31 +/- 9, p < 0.003) using Doppler energy technique. Doppler energy imaging consistently detected absent perfusion (background subtracted videointensity -6 +/- 6) and immediate reperfusion (background subtracted peak videointensity 29 +/- 15, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: With the use of a galactose-based contrast agent, Doppler energy data acquisition was superior to standard gray scale imaging in transthoracic evaluation of regional myocardial perfusion, absence of perfusion, and reperfusion.	0
15741736	Membrane targeting of a bacterial virulence factor harbouring an extended signal peptide. Filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) is the major adhesin of Bordetella pertussis, the whooping cough agent. FHA is synthesized as a 367-kDa precursor harbouring a remarkably long signal peptide with an N-terminal extension that is conserved among related virulence proteins. FHA is secreted via the two-partner secretion pathway that involves transport across the outer membrane by a cognate transporter protein. Here we have analyzed the mechanism by which FHA is targeted to, and translocated across, the inner membrane. Studies were performed both in vitro using Escherichia coli inside-out inner membrane vesicles and in vivo by pulse-chase labelling of Bordetella pertussis cells. The data collectively indicate that like classical periplasmic and outer membrane proteins, FHA requires SecA and SecB for its export through the SecYEG translocon in the inner membrane. Although short nascent chains of FHA were found to cross-link to signal recognition particle (SRP), we did not obtain indication for an SRP-dependent, co-translational membrane targeting provoked by the FHA signal sequence. Our results rule out that the extended signal peptide of FHA determines a specific mode of membrane targeting but rather suggest that it might influence the export rate at the inner membrane.	0
16155026	State-of-the-art therapeutics: Hodgkin's lymphoma. Presently Hodgkin's lymphoma can be cured in at least 80% of patients. The major challenge to the clinician in 2005 is how to cure the disease while inducing the least irreversible toxicity. This review focuses on clinical trials and institutional experiences to identify the best choice of treatment, individualized to the stage of the lymphoma permitting minimization of late toxicity such as infertility, premature menopause, cardiac disease, and most importantly, risk of second neoplasms. More than 90% of patients with limited Hodgkin's lymphoma can be cured with either short-course chemotherapy alone or even briefer chemotherapy followed by involved-field radiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that chemotherapy alone is suitable for the large majority of patients with limited disease. For the 80% of patients with advanced disease but without a large number of adverse prognostic factors, standard multi-agent chemotherapy with the well-established ABVD regimen (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) provides the best balance of effectiveness and minimization of toxicity. More intensified regimens currently under investigation are appropriate for the 20% with numerous adverse prognostic factors. In 2005 it is insufficient to focus solely on cure of Hodgkin's lymphoma. The treatment program must maximize chance of cure and minimize late toxicity. Fortunately, brief chemotherapy alone or with radiation for patients with limited disease and standard ABVD chemotherapy for patients with advanced disease offer the appropriate balance of these two requirements. Patients with advanced disease plus multiple indicators of a poor prognosis and patients with disease that persists despite optimized primary treatment require specially intensified treatment.	0
15244511	Cancer burden and trends in the Asian Pacific Rim region. This paper describes the current cancer burden and time trends, discusses dominant risk factors and prevention and control strategies, and makes future projections for the top eight cancers (stomach, lung, liver, colon/rectum, esophagus, breast, cervix, and leukemia) in the Asian Pacific Rim region. The future cancer trends through to the year 2050 are projected based on population dynamics, including population growth and ageing. In 2000, the Asian Pacific Rim had over 3 million new cancer cases, over 2 million cancer deaths, and 5.4 million people living with cancer. In 2050, 7.8 million new cancer cases and 5.7 million deaths from cancer are projected. The current cancer burden and the future projection provide facts that cancer is and will be a very serious public health problem in the Asian Pacific Rim region and will assist public health officers and cancer researchers in the design and establishment of public health policies, prioritization of future research, and application of current knowledge in the prevention and control of cancer.	0

21914941	Versatile gradients of chemistry, bound ligands and nanoparticles on alumina nanopore arrays. Nanoporous alumina (PA) arrays produced by self-ordering growth, using electrochemical anodization, have been extensively explored for potential applications based upon the unique thermal, mechanical and structural properties, and high surface-to-volume ratio of these materials. However, the potential applications and functionality of these materials may be further extended by molecular-level engineering of the surface of the pore rims. In this paper we present a method for the generation of chemical gradients on the surface of PA arrays based upon plasma co-polymerization of two monomers. We further extend these chemical gradients, which are also gradients of surface charge, to those of bound ligands and number density gradients of nanoparticles. The latter represent a highly exotic new class of materials, comprising aligned PA, capped by gold nanoparticles around the rim of the pores. Gradients of chemistry, ligands and nanoparticles generated by our method retain the porous structure of the substrate, which is important in applications that take advantage of the inherent properties of these materials. This method can be readily extended to other porous materials.	0
14684455	Converging evidence of NMDA receptor hypofunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Numerous clinical studies demonstrate that subanesthetic doses of dissociative anesthetics, which are noncompetitive antagonists at the NMDA receptor, replicate in normal subjects the cognitive impairments, negative symptoms, and brain functional abnormalities of schizophrenia. Postmortem and genetic studies have identified several abnormalities associated with schizophrenia that would interfere with the activation of the glycine modulatory site on the NMDA receptor. Placebo-controlled clinical trials with agents that directly or indirectly activate the glycine modulatory site consistently reduce negative symptoms and frequently improve cognition in patients with chronic schizophrenia who are receiving concurrent typical antipsychotics. Thus, there is convincing evidence that hypofunction of a subset of NMDA receptors may contribute to the symptomatic features of schizophrenia.	0

12719622	Facilitation of skilled finger movements by repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (RPMS) - a new approach in central paresis. A new therapeutic method for the rehabilitation of central paresis of the upper extremity, especially of fine skilled finger movements, is presented. The therapeutic concept is the activation of reorganization processes in the CNS. These processes are elicited by the induction of proprioceptive input to the CNS which corresponds physiologically to the lost input during active movements. The input is generated by repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (RPMS) at the innervation zone of the paretic muscles. The stimulation leads to a motion of the activated muscles. The proprioceptive input is generated by two mechanisms: adequately by activation of mechanoreceptors of the stimulated muscles during the induced contractions and relaxations and inadequately by direct activation of the involved sensorimotor afferents. The method has been applied to 52 patients suffering from spastic paresis of the upper extremity. A simple clinical quantification using the Ashworth scale revealed that spasticity could be remarkably (1-2 points) reduced already by one session of RPMS lasting 15 minutes. In order to get an objective insight into the improvement of active motor performances, a neurophysiological investigation of active finger extensions was performed in eight patients suffering from a central hemiparesis. Following RPMS of the paretic finger extensors, the patients could perform rapid finger extensions with larger displacement and velocity at diminished amounts of EMG activity.	0

This article provides an overview of the concept of autonomy and discusses some of the problems in its realization in long-term nursing institutions. It also outlines strategies for supporting autonomy in elderly patients and concludes with a discussion of the implications of autonomy to nursing practice and research.	0
24474797	Peptides genetically selected for NF-kB activation cooperate with oncogene Ras and model carcinogenic role of inflammation. Chronic inflammation is associated with increased cancer risk. Furthermore, the transcription factor NF-kB, a central regulator of inflammatory responses, is constitutively active in most tumors. To determine whether active NF-kB inherently contributes to malignant transformation, we isolated a set of NF-kB-activating genetic elements and tested their oncogenic potential in rodent cell transformation models. Genetic elements with desired properties were isolated using biologically active selectable peptide technology, which involves functional screening of lentiviral libraries encoding 20 or 50 amino acid-long polypeptides supplemented with endoplasmic reticulum-targeting and oligomerization domains. Twelve NF-kB-activating selectable peptides (NASPs) representing specific fragments of six proteins, none of which was previously associated with NF-kB activation, were isolated from libraries of 200,000 peptides derived from 500 human extracellular proteins. Using selective knockdown of distinct components of the NF-kB pathway, we showed that the isolated NASPs act either via or upstream of TNF receptor-associated factor 6. Transduction of NASPs into mouse and rat embryo fibroblasts did not, in itself, alter their growth. However, when coexpressed with oncogenic Ras (H-Ras(V12)), NASPs allowed rodent fibroblasts to overcome H-Ras(V12)-mediated p53-dependent senescence and acquire a transformed tumorigenic phenotype. Consistent with their ability to cooperate with oncogenic Ras in cell transformation, NASP expression reduced the transactivation activity of p53. This system provides an in vitro model of NF-kB-driven carcinogenesis and suggests that the known carcinogenic effects of inflammation may be at least partially due to NF-kB-mediated abrogation of oncogene-induced senescence.	0
8115025	Antimineralocorticoid canrenoate enhances secretory activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis in humans. In rats, both hippocampal glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) have been shown to participate in the regulation of basal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) secretory activity. Inhibition of hippocampal MRs enhanced the activity of the HPA axis in these animals. We tested the influence of potassium cancrenoate, a selective MR antagonist, on basal cortisol secretion in 10 healthy young men during sleep. Cortisol, ACTH, vasopressin and growth hormone (GH) were determined at 22.00, 23.00, 01.00, 04.00 and 07.00 h. Sleep was monitored by somnopolygraphy. Potassium canrenoate (200 mg) was administered intravenously at 08.00 and 17.00 h the preceding day. Compared with a placebo condition, potassium canrenoate elevated cortisol levels throughout the night, with significant (p < 0.05) increases at 22.00, 23.00, 01.00 and 07.00 h. Effects of canrenoate on ACTH levels were not significant, and there was also no effect on plasma vasopressin levels. GH concentrations at 04.00 and 07.00 h were higher after canrenoate than placebo (p < 0.05). Changes induced by canrenoate paralleling those in animals after intracerebroventricular administration of MR antagonists suggest that central nervous MRs are involved in the regulation of HPA secretory activity also in humans.	0
9225473	Retrofitting YACs for direct DNA transfer into plant cells. The utility of plant YAC libraries prepared in conventional YAC vectors would be dramatically increased if these YACs could be used directly for plant transformation. A pair of vectors that allow clones from YAC libraries to be modified (retrofitted) for plant transformation by direct DNA transfer methods, such as particle bombardment or electroporation, has been developed. Modification of the YAC is achieved in two sequential yeast transformation steps by taking advantage of the homologous recombination system in yeast. Using this approach, two plant-selectable marker genes and DNA sequence elements required for copy number amplification in yeast can be introduced into YACs present in yeast strain AB1380. The utility of these vectors is demonstrated by retrofitting YACs that contain inserts ranging in size from 80 to 700 kb. The 6- to 12-fold increase in copy number of these modified YACs facilitates the isolation of YAC DNA for direct DNA transformation methods. Retrofitted YACs were used for particle bombardment to examine the efficiency with which their large DNA inserts are transferred into plant cells. The availability of these retrofitting vectors should facilitate the transfer of YAC DNA inserts into plant cells and thus help bridge the gap between existing mapping techniques and plant transformation procedures.	0

Indomethacin, 40 mg/kg, given once daily for 10 consecutive days to non-fasted mini pigs very weakly irritated the pig stomach but induced multiple superficial lesions in the jejunum and ileum. 16,16-Dimethyl-PGE2-methyl ester, 10 micrograms/kg in two divided doses or 20 micrograms/kg in four divided doses for 10 days, markedly inhibited the aspirin- or indomethacin-induced gastric and intestinal lesions in mini pigs, respectively.	0

19892368	Diminished humour perception in schizophrenia: relationship to social and cognitive functioning. This study attempted to confirm that humour recognition deficits previously found in schizophrenia are specific to the condition and not attributable to other parameters such as depression or anxiety. Secondarily, we explored any possible cognitive or social functioning correlates to humour recognition deficits. A total of 60 participants (20 outpatients with schizophrenia, 20 psychiatric control participants and 20 control participants) underwent a 64-question humour task in addition to a battery of standard cognitive tests and Social Functioning Scales. In order to compare the three groups of participants, we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc t-tests on neuropsychological measures, social functioning measures, and the primary outcome, humour recognition. The schizophrenia group showed significant and substantial deficits in humour recognition compared to the healthy control group, t(38)=5.1, P<0.001, ES=-1.55 and the psychiatric control group, t(38)=3.6, P=0.001. In the schizophrenia group, humour recognition correlated positively with general intellectual functioning (NART) r=.45, P=0.04, social reasoning (WAIS-III Comprehension) r=.54, P=0.01, executive functioning (WCST-CC) r=.69, P=0.001 and social adjustment ratings (SASS scores), r=.54, P=0.02. These findings support the assertion that humour recognition deficits in schizophrenia are specific to the condition and not attributable to other factors such as depression or anxiety. Furthermore, humour recognition deficits in schizophrenia may perhaps be preferentially associated with deficiencies in set shifting and semantic cognition.	0
21540504	The role of correlations in the high-pressure phase of FeSe. This study addresses the structural and electronic properties of the NiAs- and MnP-type phases dominating in FeSe at high pressures. The analysis is performed using first-principle band structure calculations within the framework of the B3LYP hybrid exchange-correlation functional. Based on the volume-pressure relation deduced from the available experimental data, we optimize the form and internal coordinates of the unit cell, which agree reasonably well with experiment. In particular, the present calculations resolve the structural NiAs-MnP phase transition which occurs at about 10 GPa. Both structures are found to be semiconducting at low pressures and metallizing at about 80-90 GPa. Using the complementary LDA + U approach the semiconducting state can be explained as the result of the strong local correlations within the Fe d-shell.	0
19398290	The efficacy of intraperitoneal saline infusion for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluated the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with intraperitoneal saline infusion. BACKGROUND: Ultrasound-guided RFA is not always feasible due to the tumor location, possible adjacent tissue damage or poor sonographic identification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ultrasound-guided RFA with intraperitoneal saline infusion was performed in 116 patients between June 2001 and March 2008. RESULTS: The overall technical feasibility of the intraperitoneal saline infusions was 90.5% (105 patients). The purposes of the intraperitoneal saline infusion were achieved in 100 patients (86.2%) by visualizing the tumor located in hepatic dome (47 patients), prevent adjacent organ damage (42 patients) and withdrawing overlying omentum (10 patients). Complete ablation of tumor was accomplished in 102 patients (87.9%). Complications associated with the treatment occurred in seven patients (6.0%). There was no case of adverse event directly related to intraperitoneal saline infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Intraperitoneal saline infusion is an effective and safe procedure that can be used to overcome the current limitations of ultrasound-guided RFA.	0
22611382	Post-radical-prostatectomy urinary incontinence: the management of concomitant bladder neck contracture. Urinary incontinence postradical prostatectomy is a common problem which adversely affects quality of life. Concomitant bladder neck contracture in the setting of postprostatectomy incontinence represents a challenging clinical problem. Postprostatectomy bladder neck contracture is frequently recurrent and makes surgical management of incontinence difficult. The aetiology of bladder neck contracture and what constitutes the optimum management strategy are controversial. Here we review the literature and also present our approach.	0

21599910	Establishment and interspecific associations in two species of Ichthyocotylurus (Trematoda) parasites in perch (Perca fluviatilis). BACKGROUND: Co-infections of multiple parasite species in hosts may lead to interspecific associations and subsequently shape the structure of a parasite community. However, few studies have focused on these associations in highly abundant parasite species or, in particular, investigated how the associations develop with time in hosts exposed to co-infecting parasite species for the first time. We investigated metacercarial establishment and interspecific associations in the trematodes Ichthyocotylurus variegatus and I. pileatus co-infecting three age cohorts of young perch (Perca fluviatilis). RESULTS: We found that the timing of transmission of the two Ichthyocotylurus species was very similar, but they showed differences in metacercarial development essentially so that the metacercariae of I. pileatus became encapsulated faster. Correlations between the abundances of the species were significantly positive after the first summer of host life and also within the main site of infection, the swim bladder. High or low abundances of both parasite species were also more frequent in the same host individuals than expected by chance, independently of host age or size. However, the highest abundances of the species were nevertheless observed in different host individuals and this pattern was consistent in all age cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest similar temporal patterns of transmission, non-random establishment, and facilitative rather than competitive associations between the parasite species independently of the age of the infracommunities. However, we suggest that spatial differences in exposure are most likely responsible for the segregation of the parasite species observed in the few most heavily infected hosts. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, the result suggests that between-species associations should be interpreted with caution along with detailed examination of the parasite distribution among host individuals.	0
8165167	The effect of protein level fed during the prebreeder period on performance of large white turkey breeder hens after an induced molt. An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of prebreeder protein levels on reproductive performance Large White turkey breeder hens after an induced molt. One hundred and sixty-eight, Nicholas Large White turkey breeder hens were fed either 8, 12, or 16% CP diets (2,904 kcal ME/kg) during the prebreeder period from 56 to 64 wk of age. All hens were photostimulated with 15.5 h of light/d and fed a standard 16% CP breeder ration from 64 to 87 wk of age. Feed intake, plasma triglyceride concentration, reproductive performance, and body weight were regressed on age and prebreeder dietary protein intake using a general linear model. Prebreeder protein intake increased linearly as dietary CP increased. Treatments did not affect prebreeder feed consumption or subsequent egg production. Egg weight and breeder feed consumption were greatest for hens fed 12% CP during the prebreeder period. Plasma triglyceride and body weight increased as prebreeder dietary CP increased. Body weight increased from 56 to 87 wk in a cubic response as the hens aged. Feed consumption increased during the prebreeder period and decreased during the breeder period. Plasma triglyceride content was not affected by turkey hen age or stage of production.	0
14759226	Intracellular proteoglycans. Proteoglycans (PGs) are proteins with glycosaminoglycan chains, are ubiquitously expressed and have a wide range of functions. PGs in the extracellular matrix and on the cell surface have been the subject of extensive structural and functional studies. Less attention has so far been given to PGs located in intracellular compartments, although several reports suggest that these have biological functions in storage granules, the nucleus and other intracellular organelles. The purpose of this review is, therefore, to present some of these studies and to discuss possible functions linked to PGs located in different intracellular compartments. Reference will be made to publications relevant for the topics we present. It is beyond the scope of this review to cover all publications on PGs in intracellular locations.	0
17356886	The rise of [Na(+)] (i) during ischemia and reperfusion in the rat heart-underlying mechanisms. Intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)) rises in the heart during ischemia, and on reperfusion, there is a transient rise followed by a return toward control. These changes in [Na(+)](i) contribute to ischemic and reperfusion damage through their effects on Ca(2+) overload. Part of the rise of [Na(+)](i) during ischemia may be caused by increased activity of the cardiac Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE1), activated by the ischemic rise in [H(+)](i). In support of this view, NHE1 inhibitors reduce the [Na(+)](i) rise during ischemia. Another possibility is that the rise of [Na(+)](i) during ischemia is caused by Na(+) influx through channels. We have reexamined these issues by use of two different NHE1 inhibitors, amiloride, and zoniporide, in addition to tetrodotoxin (TTX), which blocks voltage-sensitive Na(+) channels. All three drugs produced cardioprotection after ischemia, but amiloride (100 microM) and TTX (300 nM) prevented the rise in [Na(+)](i) during ischemia, whereas zoniporide (100 nM) did not. Both amiloride and zoniporide prevented the rise of [Na(+)](i) on reperfusion, whereas TTX was without effect. In an attempt to explain these differences, we measured the ability of the three drugs to block Na(+) currents. At the concentrations used, TTX reduced the transient Na(+) current (I (Na)) by 11 +/- 2% while amiloride and zoniporide were without effect. In contrast, TTX largely eliminated the persistent Na(+) current (I (Na,P)) and amiloride was equally effective, whereas zoniporide had a substantially smaller effect reducing I (Na,P) to 41 +/- 8%. These results suggest that part of the effect of NHE1 inhibitors on the [Na(+)](i) during ischemia is by blockade of I (Na,P). The fact that a low concentration of TTX eliminated the rise of [Na(+)](i) during ischemia suggests that I (Na,P) is a major source of Na(+) influx in this model of ischemia.	0
9429262	Quality of life after spinal cord injury: a meta analysis of the effects of disablement components. While objective measures of impairment, disability and handicap can serve as outcome measures for the providers of medical and vocational rehabilitation services, for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) themselves the only relevant measure of quality of life (QOL) is their own judgment as to their well-being. Subjective QOL in persons with SCI has been measured as happiness, psychological well-being morale and life satisfaction. Various studies have reported inconclusive or contradictory findings, likely due to small sample size, sample composition, measures used and other methodological issues. A meta analysis was performed to try to resolve these apparent discrepancies. A total of 22 studies with an average sample size of 102, was retrieved. Information on the relationship between QOL and impairment, disability, and handicap, if provided, was abstracted. Findings include the following: persons with SCI tend to report lower subjective well-being than non-disabled people; the relationship between impairment and QOL is weak (mean correlation: -0.05: 95% confidence interval: -0.12 to 0.02), and generally not found to be statistically significant; the association between disability and QOL is somewhat stronger (mean r: -0.21; confidence interval: -0.27 to -0.14), but not found consistently; the relationship between QOL and (aspects of) handicap is strongest (range for mean r: -0.17 to -0.48), and fairly consistently found. The number of studies available is too small to make analysis of factors that explain contradictory findings possible. Further use of subjective QOL measures in research on long-term outcomes of SCI is recommended, in order to properly reflect the perspective of the patients/clients themselves.	0
11920342	A thirty percent chronic decline in inverse serum creatinine is an excellent predictor of late renal allograft failure. We previously reported that the percentage of change in inverse serum creatinine (Delta1/Cr) was the best of several time-dependent serum creatinine-derived predictors of renal allograft failure in patients not administered cyclosporine (CsA). To further validate the utility of Delta1/Cr, we collected creatinine levels (mean, 90.7 +/- 45.2 creatinine measurements) in 100 patients treated for 6.7 +/- 5.9 years with CsA. We also validated Delta1/Cr using a limited creatinine-sampling strategy, then performed multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis of 1,663 transplantations. A time-dependent covariate determined by the date of first chronic decline (excluding creatinine levels from periods of acute rejection) in Delta1/Cr to less than -30% of baseline similarly was predictive of graft failure in 101 patients treated without CsA (relative risk, 5.04; 95% confidence interval, 2.18 to 11.6; P = 0.0002) and 100 patients treated with CsA (relative risk, 5.02; 95% confidence interval, 2.50 to 10.1; P < 0.0001). A limited creatinine-sampling strategy (measured at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months, and each year thereafter) reduced the ability of Delta1/Cr less than -30% to predict graft failure. In 1,663 patients, Delta1/Cr less than -30% first occurred a median of 1.0 years posttransplantation (n = 792 of 1,663 patients) and 3.0 years before graft failure (n = 478 of 897 patients with graft failure). In a multivariate model (n = 1,663) that included baseline function, acute rejection, and other covariates, Delta1/Cr less than -30% was a strong independent predictor of graft failure (relative risk, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.12 to 3.09; P < 0.0001). Thus, Delta1/Cr less than -30% is an excellent predictor of graft failure that is similarly predictive in patients treated with and without CsA. A limited sampling strategy for creatinine diminishes, but does not negate, the usefulness of Delta1/Cr less than -30%.	0
21961746	Brazilian canine hepatozoonosis. The genus Hepatozoon includes hundreds of species that infect birds, reptiles, amphibians and mammals, in all continents with tropical and subtropical climates. Two species have been described in domestic dogs: H. canis, reported in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America and the United States; and H. americanum, which so far has only been diagnosed in the United States. In Brazil, the only species found infecting dogs is H. canis. The objective of this review was to detail some aspects of canine hepatozoonosis, caused by H. canis, and the main points of its biology, transmission, pathogenicity, symptoms, epidemiology and diagnostic methods, with emphasis on research developed in Brazil.	0

11126463	Stressful events and information processing dispositions moderate the relationship between positive and negative affect: implications for pain patients. Relationships between positive affect, negative affect, and pain were analyzed as a prospective function of stressful events in a sample of rheumatoid arthritis patients and as a cross-sectional function of an information processing disposition in persons with fibromyalgia. Positive affect and negative affect were statistically separate factors overall in both samples. In addition, negative affect and pain were related across all conditions. However, positive affect and negative affect were more negatively correlated during stressful periods and more negatively correlated for patients who processed information in a more simplistic fashion. Also, positive affect predicted pain during stressful times and did so for patients who processed information more simplistically as well. These data suggest positive affect and negative affect are unique factors whose interrelation and external correlates are not static.	0

16370387	Potential role of the antiproliferative cytokine beta-galactoside binding protein in cancer therapy. This review highlights the discovery of beta-galactoside binding protein (betaGBP), an antiproliferative cytokine, as a potent and selective anticancer agent. Unlike drugs designed to block receptor tyrosine kinases or specific control points along signaling pathways, betaGBP does not harm normal cells. As a physiological effector molecule, betaGBP can selectively induce death in cancer cells by enforcing its regulatory functions to which normal and cancer cells respond differently, and thus exploit the genetic and molecular deviations developed by cancer cells.	0

15925743	Genome-wide scan for hypertension in Sydney Sibships: the GENIHUSS study. We report here the results of the GENIHUSS study (GENetic Investigation of Hypertension Undertaken in Sydney Sibships)-a genome-wide scan to identify loci linked to essential hypertension (HT). Subjects were Anglo-Celtic Australian sibpairs resident in or near Sydney, Australia, with onset of HT before age 60 years (mean, 44 +/- 13 SD years). A 10-cM scan involving 400 microsatellite markers and 252 HT sibpairs was followed by fine mapping of the most promising locus using 296 HT sibpairs (481 individuals from 200 families). Multipoint and two-point nonparametric linkage analyses were performed using MAPMAKER/SIBS, GENEHUNTER II, and SPLINK. Suggestive loci were found on chromosomes 1 (4 cM) and 4 (129 cM). The chromosome 4 locus coincided with a QTL for systolic blood pressure (BP) in the Australian Victorian Family Heart Study, and the locus on chromosome 1 contains the chloride channel gene CLCNKB and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 gene TNFRSF1B, which have each shown association with HT. Our study adds to findings of HT loci emanating from genome scans.	0

20798830	Multicolor bleach-rate imaging enlightens in vivo sterol transport. Elucidation of in vivo cholesterol transport and its aberrations in cardiovascular diseases requires suitable model organisms and the development of appropriate monitoring technology. We recently presented a new approach to visualize transport of the intrinsically fluorescent sterol, dehydroergosterol (DHE) in the genetically tractable model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). DHE is structurally very similar to cholesterol and ergosterol, two sterols used by the sterol-auxotroph nematode. We developed a new computational method measuring fluorophore bleaching kinetics at every pixel position, which can be used as a fingerprint to distinguish rapidly bleaching DHE from slowly bleaching autofluorescence in the animals. Here, we introduce multicolor bleach-rate sterol imaging. By this method, we demonstrate that some DHE is targeted to a population of basolateral recycling endosomes (RE) labelled with GFP-tagged RME-1 (GFP-RME-1) in the intestine of both, wild-type nematodes and mutant animals lacking intestinal gut granules (glo1-mutants). DHE-enriched intestinal organelles of glo1-mutants were decorated with GFPrme8, a marker for early endosomes. No co-localization was found with a lysosomal marker, GFP-LMP1. Our new methods hold great promise for further studies on endosomal sterol transport in C. elegans.	0
23488299	[Complicated colonic diverticulitis at 34 weeks gestation]. Peritonitis is a set of symptoms of varying etiology usually with an accompanying infection, systemic and local changes within the peritoneal cavity Colonic diseases, especially colon perforation, are one of the most common causes of peritonitis. The course of the disease may be turbulent due to sudden perforation. In case of limited peritonitis the disease is not as acute as the perforation hole is small and it can be sealed by the omentum and internal organs. Abdominal pain is usually located around the source of infection and is less severe. A 38-year-old patient at 34 weeks gestation was hospitalized in the obstetric-gynecological ward of the Health Care Center with a diagnosis of preterm delivery urinary infection and renal colic. Due to increasing peritoneal symptoms and deteriorating general condition of the patient, a decision to perform immediately exploratory laparotomy combined with the Cesarean section was made. The surgeon indicated a place in the left mesogastrium that could correspond with a drained interintestinal abscess and also found a large amount of fibrin in the lower floor of the peritoneal cavity The initial point of the abscess remained unknown and the patient received total parenteral nutrition for 10 days. On 5 postoperative day the drain was removed from the peritoneal cavity and since day 10 patient health was steadily improving. Bacteriological cultures revealed abundant growth of E. coli that showed sensitivity to the used antibiotics. On 22 postoperative day the patient and her child were discharged home in good condition. Five months later the patient was admitted to the surgical ward with acute abdominal pain with the diagnosis of an abscess in her left mesogastric and subgastric area, perforation of sigmoid diverticulum and fecal fistula. Our case illustrates great difficulties in diagnosing diseases of the abdominal cavity during pregnancy because causes and symptoms may be typical of this condition, as well as of unrelated diseases, including: kidney problems, appendicitis, cholecystitis and bowel disease. Examination of the pregnant patient presents a challenge and the symptoms are uncharacteristic. Tension of the abdominal wall, as well as the muscles of the digestive and urinary tract are reduced and the topography of the internal organs changes during pregnancy. The interpretation of laboratory tests becomes more difficult. In our case, the initial local peritonitis, caused by microperforation of the diverticulum, ran a latent course and was masked by both pregnancy and renal colic symptoms, consequently leading to diffuse peritonitis. The presented case demonstrates the importance of the problem and forces obstetricians to be more vigilant in determining the diagnosis and decision-making, because of its meaning for the health and even the life of the patient and her child.	0

7261476	Maturation-linked expression of C3b and C3b' receptors on developing human bone marrow and peripheral blood granulocytes. The sequential expression of granulocyte membrane receptors for C3b, C3b' and C3d have been investigated in normal human bone marrow and peripheral blood. In particular the relationship between receptor expression and morphological characteristics of granulocyte maturation has been assessed. The result indicate that C3b receptor development precedes that of the Fc-IgG receptor and is present on all neutrophil precursors with the exception of the agranular myeloblast. Furthermore, there is, in contrast to Fc-IgG receptors, no difference (P greater than 0.35) in C3b receptor expression between marrow and peripheral blood segmented neutrophils. An apparent subpopulation of granulocytes also appear to have receptors for C3b' whereas receptors for C3d were not detected at all during granulocyte maturation. The application of these findings to the normal in vivo functions of granulocytes and to the study of abnormal granulocyte populations in myeloproliferative disorders is discussed.	0

20403056	Relationship between clinical conditions and use of Veterans Affairs health care among Medicare-enrolled veterans. OBJECTIVE: To determine how reliance on Veterans Affairs (VA) for medical care among veterans enrolled in Medicare is affected by medical conditions, access, and patient characteristics. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs. STUDY DESIGN: We examined reliance on the VA for inpatient, outpatient, and overall medical care among all VA users in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 who were also enrolled in Medicare. We calculated the marginal effects of patient factors on VA reliance using fractional logistic regression; we also analyzed overall VA reliance separately for under-65 and age-65+ groups. The primary focus of this analysis was the relationship between aggregated condition categories (ACCs), which represent medical conditions, and reliance on the VA. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mean VA reliance was significantly higher in the under-65 population than in the age-65+ group (0.800 versus 0.531). Lower differential distance to the VA, and higher VA-determined priority for health care, predicted higher VA reliance. Most individual ACCs were negatively associated with VA reliance, though substance abuse and mental health disorders were significantly associated with increased reliance on VA care. Conditions of the eyes and ears/nose/throat had positive marginal effect on VA reliance for the under 65, while diabetes was positive for age 65+. Among inpatients, veterans with ACCs for mental health conditions, eye conditions, amputations, or infectious and parasitic conditions had higher likelihood of a VA hospitalization than inpatients without these conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Many dually enrolled Veterans use both Medicare and VA health care. Age, accessibility, and priority level for VA services have a clear relationship with VA reliance. Because dual use is common, coordination of care among health care settings for such patients should be a policy priority.	0
14755235	Rapid control of an outbreak of Staphylococcus aureus on a neonatal intensive care department using standard infection control practices and nasal mupirocin. BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen in neonatal intensive care departments, causing significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Frequently, S aureus outbreaks may last for months or years. After a cluster of 4 clinically significant S aureus infections in a 7-day period in our 35-bed neonatal intensive care department, we immediately introduced standard outbreak control measures. Unique to our approach was the addition of immediate nasal mupirocin treatment of all staff members and selected patients. METHODS: Patients were screened for S aureus colonization and were cohorted with separate caregivers. S aureus isolates were submitted to a reference laboratory for pulse-field gel electrophoretic typing. Infection control practices were emphasized and education was provided for staff, physicians, and parents of patients. All caregivers and selected patients were treated immediately with nasal mupirocin. Cohorting was maintained until all patients who were colonized or infected were discharged. RESULTS: A total of 5 patients were found to be infected and 4 of 19 patients tested were found to be colonized during the study period. Patients who were infected were successfully treated. Secondary colonization and infection did not occur after implementation of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and comprehensive implementation of standard outbreak controls along with immediate treatment of direct care staff and patients with nasal mupirocin successfully controlled this outbreak within 4 weeks and no further cases have been noted.	0
12027419	Direct transfer of p65 into T lymphocytes from systemic lupus erythematosus patients leads to increased levels of interleukin-2 promoter activity. The recent identification of a number of molecular defects in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has raised expectations for gene replacement therapy as an option in the treatment of these diseases. In this report, we have adapted an electroporation-based technique to transfer successfully DNA to peripheral blood T cells from normal individuals and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Transfection efficiency, judged by the percentage of live cells expressing green fluorescence after transfection with a pGFP (green fluorescence protein), reached 32 +/- 3% in normal, 13 +/- 3% in SLE, and 17 +/- 13% in RA T cells. The transfection efficiency was slightly higher in CD8+ than in CD4+ cells, and the cells maintained acceptable (75%) viability up to the fourth post-transfection day. SLE T cells have been shown to display low levels of the p65 subunit of the NF-kappaB transcription factor and decreased production of IL-2. Since NF-kappaB contributes to the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 promoter, the effect of the forced replenishment of p65 on IL-2 transcription was tested. The low level of interleukin-2 promoter activity in SLE T cells increased to normal levels following transfection with cDNA encoding the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of transfection of T cells from SLE patients by electroporation and the reversal of decreased interleukin-2 promoter activity in SLE T cells, and are an early step toward gene therapy as a method of treatment for these individuals.	1
23335972	Direct homo- and hetero-interactions of MeCP2 and MBD2. Epigenetic marks like methylation of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides are essential for mammalian development and play a major role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin architecture. The methyl-cytosine binding domain (MBD) protein family recognizes and translates this methylation mark. We have recently shown that the level of MeCP2 and MBD2, two members of the MBD family, increased during differentiation and their ectopic expression induced heterochromatin clustering in vivo. As oligomerization of these MBD proteins could constitute a factor contributing to the chromatin clustering effect, we addressed potential associations among the MBD family performing a series of different interaction assays in vitro as well as in vivo. Using recombinant purified MBDs we found that MeCP2 and MBD2 showed the stronger self and cross association as compared to the other family members. Besides demonstrating that these homo- and hetero-interactions occur in the absence of DNA, we could confirm them in mammalian cells using co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Employing a modified form of the fluorescent two-hybrid protein-protein interaction assay, we could clearly visualize these associations in single cells in vivo. Deletion analysis indicated that the region of MeCP2 comprising amino acids 163-309 as well the first 152 amino acids of MBD2 are the domains responsible for MeCP2 and MBD2 associations. Our results strengthen the possibility that MeCP2 and MBD2 direct interactions could crosslink chromatin fibers and therefore give novel insight into the molecular mechanism of MBD mediated global heterochromatin architecture.	0
12900598	Algorithm of hair restoration surgery in children. Hair is an inseparable element of external appearance of every human being. Although various fashion trends come and go, the lack of hair is for many a major aesthetic and psychological problem. Even if men's balding can be accepted as a natural phenomenon, hair loss in children is considered to be a condition demanding correction. During an 18-year period, 8440 hair restoration operations were performed at the Hair Clinic Poznan, in Poznan, Poland. Most patients were men treated for androgenic alopecia. Among the patients were 57 children in whom hair loss resulted from hereditary factors, perinatal traumas, radiotherapy, and mechanical, thermal, and chemical damage. Methods of restoration were adjusted to type of hair loss, patient age, and ability to cooperate with the surgeon. In cases of single massive scars, skin flap correction was usually used. The flaps were prepared with the use of expanders. In cases of numerous scattered defects or considerable thinning of the scalp, the method of choice was hair transplantation. The \"four-hand stick-and-place\" technique developed by the authors enabled the surgeon to quickly and precisely carry out the procedure. Application of varied surgery techniques in scalp reconstruction procedures in children gave very good aesthetic results with a minimal complication rate.	0
24033753	Clinical experience of subcutaneous and transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators in children and teenagers. BACKGROUND: Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) systems have no components in contact with the heart and may avoid complications such as lead fracture, venous obstruction, or endocarditis that occur with transvenous leads. Concerns have been raised regarding inappropriate shocks and pocket erosion with S-ICD systems. We have compared the performance of S-ICD and transvenous ICD systems in children and teenagers. METHODS: We studied consecutive patients <20 years of age who received an ICD over a 4-year period in two Scottish centers. Baseline characteristics, complications, and ICD therapy were recorded. The primary outcome measure was survival. The secondary outcome measure was survival-free from inappropriate ICD therapy or system revision. RESULTS: Nine S-ICD were implanted in nine patients. Eight transvenous ICD were implanted in six patients; two were redo procedures. Baseline characteristics were well matched. Median duration of follow-up was lower for S-ICD (20 months) than for transvenous ICD (36 months, P = 0.0262). Survival was 100% in both groups. Survival free of inappropriate therapy or system revision was 89% for S-ICD and 25% for transvenous ICD systems (log-rank test, P = 0.0237). No S-ICD were extracted, but three transvenous ICD were extracted due to infection (n = 1) and lead failure (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: In real-world use in children and teenagers, S-ICD may offer similar survival benefit to transvenous ICD, with a lower incidence of complications requiring reoperation. In the absence of randomized trials, S-ICD should be compared prospectively with transvenous ICD in large multicenter registries with comparable periods of follow-up.	0
19292079	[Current trends in the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with hematological malignancies and solid neoplasms]. OBJECTIVES: to characterize the epidemiological and microbiological spectrum of systemic infections in hematological and oncological patients. METHOD: a prospective study of bloodstream infections was conducted between May 2004-December 2005 in two hospitals from Ia  i. RESULTS: We investigated a total of 86 suspected episodes of systemic infections that occurred in 76 selected patients, 40 males and 36 females (average age = 26 years old). There were 39 (45.35%) febrile episodes with positive blood culture and 47 (54.65%) with negative blood culture. The most common microorganisms were gram-positive cocci 12 (30.76%), followed by stable cell-wall deficient forms 9 (23.07%), gram-negative bacteria 7 (17.95%), gram-positive bacteria 5 (12.82%), fungi 4 (10.25%), and anaerobes 2 (5%). From the total of 23 cell-wall deficient form strains (58.97%), 14 returned to their typical morphology (6 gram-positive cocci, 5 gram-positive bacilli, 3 gram-negative bacilli) and 9 were L-stable. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The isolation rate of 45.5% was in accordance with literature reports; similar percentages of gram-positive and gram-negative isolates were found (the shift from predominating gram-negative to a gram-positive etiology was noted). 2) A high proportion of cell wall deficient forms was found, rarely reported in previous studies. 3) Studies reporting local microbiological findings are necessary because they support an initial empiric antibiotic regimens for prophylaxis or therapy more accurately than from other areas. The right treatment protocols remain to be established.	0
12935644	Elder abuse and neglect: social problems revealed from 15 autopsy cases. This study examined the elder abuse cases that occurred in Gifu Prefecture, Japan between 1990 and 2000. We conducted a retrospective study of all the cases in which the victim was 65 years or older and autopsied in the Department of Legal Medicine, Gifu University School of Medicine. Fifteen victims were classified as elder abuse victims: five men and ten women. The victims ranged in age from 66 to 87 years (mean age, 74.5 years). The types of abuse were as follows: physical abuse, 13 cases; emotional abuse, five cases; neglect, four cases; and financial abuse, three cases. In eight cases, the victims were subjected to two or more types of abuse. The cause of death of the victims varied with the type of abuse. In the physical abuse cases, subdural hemorrhage was the most common cause, followed by other violence-related deaths and hypothermia. In the neglect cases, the victims died of either starvation or suffocation after the aspiration of food into the airway. In the domestic abuse cases, one of the victim's sons was the most common perpetrator, and little or no income was considered to be a risk factor for perpetrators. In the neglect cases, dementia and difficulty in performing activities of daily living were considered to be risk factors for victims, in addition to living in social isolation.	0
24069757	Why women are dying from unsafe abortion: narratives of Ghanaian abortion providers. In Ghana, despite the availability of safe, legally permissible abortion services, high rates of morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion persist. Through interviews with Ghanaian physicians on the front lines of abortion provision, we begin to describe major barriers to widespread safe abortion. Their stories illustrate the life-threatening impact that stigma, financial restraints, and confusion regarding abortion law have on the women of Ghana who seek abortion. They posit that the vast majority of serious abortion complications arise in the setting of clandestine or self-induced second trimester attempts, suggesting that training greater numbers of physicians to perform second trimester abortion is prerequisite to reducing maternal mortality. They also recognized that an adequate supply of abortion providers alone is a necessary but insufficient step toward reducing death from unsafe abortion. Rather, improved accessibility and cultural acceptability of abortion are integral to the actual utilization of safe services. Their insights suggest that any comprehensive plan aimed at reducing maternal mortality must consider avenues that address the multiple dimensions which influence the practice and utilization of safe abortion, especially in the second trimester.	0
18687219	[Construction and expression of non-fusional expression vector of the multi-epitope gene of hepatitis B virus]. AIM: To study the cloning, expression and antigen of therapeutic multi-epitope gene of hepatitis B virus. METHODS: The multi-epitope gene of hepatitis B virus(BPT) was designed, synthesized and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pBAD/gIIIA. Then it was transformed into E.coli Top10 and multi-epitope protein of hepatitis B virus(B-BPT) was expressed under the induction of Arabinose. The immunogenicity of the protein was analyzed by Western blot detection. RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid pBAD/BPT was constructed successfully and the protein of multi-epitope gene of hepatitis B virus was expressed in E.coli. Western blot detection showed the protein had ideal antigenicity. CONCLUSION: The design of therapeutic multi-epitope gene of hepatitis B virus is proved to be correct. The expressed protein may be a good therapeutic vaccine.	0
9373087	Transoral electromyographic recordings in botulinum toxin-injected rat larynges. Objective assessment of muscle function following botulinum toxin injections in laryngeal muscles is difficult in human subjects. We developed a rat laryngeal model for the study of botulinum toxin injection. A new laryngoscopic technique has made it possible to observe the rat larynx endoscopically and to obtain electromyographic measurements during and after injection of toxin. The electromyographic interference pattern, fibrillation potentials, and vocal fold movement were used for analyzing dose and volume effects of injected toxin. We conclude that the lowest dosage able to produce the maximal duration of functional laryngeal impairment is 0.07 U in a volume of 0.4 microL. This model will enable us to obtain physiologic and histologic parameters that can be used to assess the selection of optimal treatment regimens with botulinum toxin for the treatment of patients with spasmodic dysphonia.	0
21097660	Modeling social influences on human health. Social interactions have long-term physiological, psychological, and behavioral consequences. Social isolation is a well-recognized but little understood risk factor and prognostic marker of disease; it can have profoundly detrimental effects on both mental and physical well-being, particularly during states of compromised health. In contrast, the health benefits associated with social support (both reduced risk and improved recovery) are evident in a variety of illnesses and injury states; however, the mechanisms by which social interactions influence disease pathogenesis remain largely unidentified. The substantial health impact of the psychosocial environment can occur independently of traditional disease risk factors and is not accounted for solely by peer-encouraged development of health behaviors. Instead, social interactions are capable of altering shared pathophysiological mechanisms of multiple disease states in distinct measurable ways. Converging evidence from animal models of injury and disease recapitulates the physiological benefits of affiliative social interactions and establishes several endogenous mechanisms (inflammatory signals, glucocorticoids, and oxytocin) by which social interactions influence health outcomes. Taken together, both clinical and animal research are undoubtedly necessary to develop a complete mechanistic understanding of social influences on health.	0
7898740	Relating pharmacology to clinical practice: the pharmacologic basis of rational polypharmacy. Many patients with epilepsy can be successfully treated with a single antiepileptic drug (monotherapy). However, in a substantial number of patients, monotherapy does not provide satisfactory seizure control, and the use of two or more drugs, or polypharmacy, is required. Selection of rational combination therapy requires consideration of the clinical antiepileptic or anticonvulsant effects, adverse effects, drug interactions, and relationship between effective and toxic drug levels. Mechanisms of action of each agent must also be studied. Optimal combination therapy often is achieved with drugs that have different mechanisms of action, relatively few adverse effects, high therapeutic indexes, and limited or no drug interactions. The goal of rational polypharmacy is to produce improved seizure control with minimal or no adverse effects.	0

22262376	Intraoperative assessment of the stability of the distal tibiofibular joint in supination-external rotation injuries of the ankle: sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of two clinical tests. BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver reliability of the hook test and the stress test for the intraoperative diagnosis of instability of the distal tibiofibular joint following fixation of ankle fractures resulting from supination-external rotation forces. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 140 patients with an unstable unilateral ankle fracture resulting from a supination-external rotation mechanism (Lauge-Hansen SE). After internal fixation of the malleolar fracture, a hook test and an external rotation stress test under fluoroscopy were performed independently by the lead surgeon and assisting surgeon, followed by a standardized 7.5-Nm external rotation stress test of each ankle under fluoroscopy. A positive stress test result was defined as a side-to-side difference of >2 mm in the tibiotalar or the tibiofibular clear space on mortise radiographs. The sensitivity and specificity of each test were calculated with use of the standardized 7.5-Nm external rotation stress test as a reference. RESULTS: Twenty-four (17%) of the 140 patients had a positive standardized 7.5-Nm external rotation stress test after internal fixation of the malleolar fracture. The hook test had a sensitivity of 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.45) and a specificity of 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.0) for the detection of the same instabilities. The external rotation stress test had a sensitivity of 0.58 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.76) and a specificity of 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 0.98). Both tests had excellent interobserver reliability, with 99% agreement for the hook test and 98% for the stress test. CONCLUSIONS: Interobserver agreement for the hook test and the clinical stress test was excellent, but the sensitivity of these tests was insufficient to adequately detect instability of the syndesmosis intraoperatively.	0
16739424	Distribution of Anopheles albimanus, Anopheles vestitipennis, and Anopheles crucians associated with land use in northern Belize. Anthropogenic land use changes often alter natural patterns of disease transmission. The goal of this study was to determine whether phosphorus input from sugarcane, Saccharum officinarum L., cultivation in northern Belize could pose a significant environmental impact on malaria transmission by changing vegetation structure and composition of wetlands and associated larval habitats. Our primary focus was on the increased dominance of cattail, Typha domingensis Pers., a favored habitat for Anopheles vestitipennis Dyar _ Knab. A land cover classification based on satellite imagery was used to select 20 marshes impacted by agricultural runoff and 20 marshes surrounded by forest (nonimpacted). A 100-m transect was established into each of the 40 marshes. Water, vegetation, and larval sampling were conducted at the 0-, 10-, 25-, 50-, and 100-m locations along the transect. Analyses of larval density data indicated that Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann was negatively correlated with percentage of cover of Typha (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001) but positively correlated with sparse Eleocharis cellulosa Torr. (rush) cover (R2 = 0.19, P < 0.05) and presence of cyanobacterial mats (CBM) (R2 = 0.33, P < 0.0001). An. vestitipennis was found to be positively correlated with percentage of cover of Typha (R2 = 0.19, P < 0.001). Canonical correspondence analysis identified CBM and light as the variables associated with the presence of An. albimanuts larvae, Typha cover with An. vestitipennis larvae, and Eleocharis and absence of light with Anopheles crucians (Wiedemann). A positive correlation also existed between marshes adjacent to agricultural activities and presence of An. vestitipennis (R2 = 0.37, P < 0.05). These results indicate that marshes in proximity to agricultural fields are conducive for Typha growth, thereby providing habitat for the more efficient malaria vector	0

16170567	The treatment of mice with Lactobacillus casei induces protection against Babesia microti infection. In this study, we report that administration of Lactobacillus casei confers protection to mice against the intracellular protozoan Babesia microti. Mice treated with L. casei orally or intraperitoneally were inoculated 7 days later with an infectious dose of B. microti. Mice treated with lactobacilli showed significant reduction in the percentage of parasitized erythrocytes (PPE) compared to untreated mice. When mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with L. casei 3 or 0 days before challenge with B. microti, the PPE was significantly lower compared to untreated mice and there were no differences between treated mice and mice immune to B. microti infection. When mice treated with live or dead L. casei were compared to mice inoculated with Freund Complete Adjuvant before a B. microti infection, a significant reduction of PPE was observed. These results show the protective effect of L. casei administered to mice against a B. microti infection and suggest that it might act by stimulating the innate immune system.	0
19486499	Isolation of Bdellovibrio as biological therapeutic agents used for the treatment of Aeromonas hydrophila infection in fish. Fourteen strains of Bdellovibrio-like organisms were isolated from cultured fish ponds using Aeromonas hydrophila J-1 as host, one of them formed large plaques after 48 h of incubation at 28 degrees C on a double layer plate, designated as Bdellovibrio C-1. The Bdellovibrio was confirmed by electron microscopy and PCR amplification of Bdellovibrio-specific 16S rDNA. The optimum temperature for the growth of BdC-1 was between 15-37 degrees C and with optimal activity at temperatures of 25-30 degrees C. The ability of BdC-1 to lyse A. hydrophila was similar in the pH range of 6.5 to 8.5. It can lyse 23 Gram-negative bacterial strains comprising three genera of fish pathogens and one strain of Escherichia coli but cannot lyse Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtillis and Staphylococcus aureus. Immersion of fish in water containing different concentrations of BdC-1 was used in protection against an experimental infection of A. hydrophila J-1. Results show that the mortality of groups immersed with BdC-1 was lower than the group without BdC-1. These results suggest that it may be possible to use Bdellovibrio to control the disease caused by A. hydrophila.	0

22026553	Contemporary microsurgical concept for the treatment of Cushing's disease: endocrine outcome in 83 consecutive patients. BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that occult adenoma remnants are responsible for persistent Cushing's disease (CD) following transsphenoidal surgery (TSS). To optimize the outcome, we have adapted our microsurgical concept. The influence of our surgical strategy on remission rate and pituitary function is presented. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: 83 patients undergoing TSS for newly diagnosed CD. An enlarged resection was performed in 36 patients. A modified exploration technique with radial incisions was performed in 19 patients in whom an adenoma was not readily detectable. RESULTS: The overall remission rate of primary surgery was 84  3% (70/83). A remission rate of 87  5% (63/72) was achieved in microadenomas. Six patients with microadenomas were re-operated for persistence, and hypercortisolism was corrected in five of them. With re-operation included, the overall remission rate for microadenomas was 94  4%. No procedure-related complications occurred in primary surgery. Of the patients in remission, 72  5% had early postoperative random cortisol levels below 2  g/dl, 17  4% had cortisol levels between 2 and 5  g/dl, and 10  1% had cortisol levels >5  g/dl. 15  2% of the patients with microadenomas developed postoperative partial hypopituitarism and 3% diabetes insipidus. No increased rate of hypopituitarism was found with enlarged adenomectomy compared to selective adenomectomy. Only a slightly higher rate of partial hypopituitarism (23  1%) was found if extensive exploration was required. CONCLUSION: With our microsurgical concept, a high initial cure rate is achievable with minimal surgical morbidity. Enlarged adenomectomy has no adverse effect on the rate of postoperative hypopituitarism. Early repeat surgery is a successful option if CD persists.	0

9256076	Conserved features of selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) elements in selenoprotein W cDNAs from five species. SECIS elements form stem-loop structures in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of eukaryotic mRNAs that encode selenoproteins. These elements direct incorporation of selenocysteine at UGA codons, provided the SECIS element lies a sufficient distance from the UGA. The cDNAs encoding skeletal muscle selenoprotein W from human, rhesus monkey, sheep, rat, and mouse contained highly similar SECIS elements that retained important features common to all known SECIS elements. Comparative analysis of these SECIS elements showed that in some regions both predicted secondary structure and nucleotide sequences were conserved, in other areas secondary structure was maintained using different primary sequence, and in still other portions, base pairing was not conserved. The rodent and sheep selenoprotein W mRNAs used UGA as a stop codon and as a selenocysteine codon. Thus, UGA specified both selenocysteine incorporation and termination in a single mRNA. The selenoprotein W SECIS elements contained an additional highly conserved base-paired stem that may prevent inappropriate selenocysteine incorporation at the UGA stop codons.	0
8825833	Hereditary spastic paraplegia with dementia. OBJECTIVE: Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) with dementia is a very rare condition. The aim of the paper is to present the first report of HSP in a Fijian Indian family. METHOD: A psychiatrist and a general physician examined the affected members of the family on five occasions over three years. RESULTS: There are three affected individuals in a sibship of seven. The parents are without symptoms and the marriage is non-consanguineous. The course of the disease has been remarkably similar. All subjects were healthy and performing well in the early years of school. In two, symptoms of cognitive loss preceded difficulty with ambulation and in the third, these symptoms appeared concurrently. All subjects had both symptoms by 13 years of age; they were unable to ambulate independently by the mid to late teens, at which time there was dysarthria spastic paraplegia and dementia. One subject suffered a three month episode of hypomanic behaviour. Over the three-year study period deterioration was slight but noticeable. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that HSP is more commonly associated with pre-senile dementia than is currently recognised. HSP with dementia is a very rare cause of failing school performance. Physical examination of the patient and other family members is indicated if this diagnosis is being considered.	0
23979748	Effects of bacteriocins on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. Control of biofilms formed by microbial pathogens is an important subject for medical researchers, since the development of biofilms on foreign-body surfaces often causes biofilm-associated infections in patients with indwelling medical devices. The present study examined the effects of different kinds of bacteriocins, which are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by certain bacteria, on biofilms formed by a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The activities and modes of action of three bacteriocins with different structures (nisin A, lacticin Q, and nukacin ISK-1) were evaluated. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of MRSA infections, showed bactericidal activity against planktonic cells but not against biofilm cells. Among the tested bacteriocins, nisin A showed the highest bactericidal activity against both planktonic cells and biofilm cells. Lacticin Q also showed bactericidal activity against both planktonic cells and biofilm cells, but its activity against biofilm cells was significantly lower than that of nisin A. Nukacin ISK-1 showed bacteriostatic activity against planktonic cells and did not show bactericidal activity against biofilm cells. Mode-of-action studies indicated that pore formation leading to ATP efflux is important for the bactericidal activity against biofilm cells. Our results suggest that bacteriocins that form stable pores on biofilm cells are highly potent for the treatment of MRSA biofilm infections.	0

17700720	Chronic exposure of sensory neurones to increased levels of nerve growth factor modulates CB1/TRPV1 receptor crosstalk. BACKGROUND: Anandamide (AEA) activates both cannabinoid CB(1) and TRPV1 receptors, which are expressed on cultured dorsal root ganglion neurones. Increased levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) are associated with chronic pain states. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The aim of this study was to compare of the effects of AEA on CB(1) receptor signalling and TRPV1-CB(1) crosstalk in low and high concentrations of NGF, using voltage-clamp electrophysiology and Fura-2 calcium imaging. KEY RESULTS: Chronic exposure to high NGF (200 ng ml(-1)) as compared to low NGF (20 ng ml(-1)) increases the proportion of neurones that exhibit an inward current in response to AEA (1 microM), from 7 to 29%. In contrast, inhibition of voltage-gated calcium currents by AEA is not significantly different in low NGF (33+/-9%, compared to high NGF 28+/-6%). Crosstalk between CB and TRPV1 receptors is modulated by exposure to high NGF. In low NGF, exposure to the CB(1) receptor antagonist, SR141716A, (100 nM) increases the percentage of neurones in which AEA elicits an increase in [Ca(2+)](i), from 10 to 23%. In high NGF, the antagonist does not alter the percentage of responders (33 to 30%). In low NGF, exposure to the CB receptor agonist, WIN55 (1 microM) reduces capsaicin-mediated increases in [Ca(2+)](i) to 28+/-8% of control as compared to an enhancement to 172+/-26% of control observed in high NGF. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that cannabinoid-mediated modulation of TRPV1 receptor activation is altered after exposure to high NGF.	0
15382088	Autoregulation of the N-myc gene is operative in neuroblastoma and involves histone deacetylase 2. BACKGROUND: Autoregulation of the myc gene family is a negative feedback mechanism known to occur at high levels of Myc expression. Loss of this mechanism and associated Myc overexpression has been observed in human tumors, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. The childhood tumor neuroblastoma is characterized by N-myc amplification in aggressive and highly proliferative tumors that occur in a subset of patients. The precise molecular mechanism of autoregulation is unknown, and previous observations indicated that N-myc autoregulation was intact only in single-copy neuroblastoma cell lines. METHODS: Transient reporter assays and trichostatin A (TSA) experiments were performed to evaluate several candidate genes, including Mxi1, c-myc promoter binding protein 1 (MBP-1), Miz, and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), for their involvement in N-myc autoregulation. Mxi1 and HDAC2 were examined further for their expression levels and effects on endogenous N-myc levels. Finally, their recruitments to the N-myc promoter were investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). RESULTS: The autoregulatory circuit was operative, even in amplified cell lines. Mxi1 consistently showed a modest effect in down-regulating N-myc in transient reporter assays. Overexpression of the c-myc, Mxi1, and mHDAC2 genes resulted in a threefold to fourfold decrease in endogenous N-myc levels. Mxi1 and HDAC2 were up-regulated by N-Myc in an myc-inducible cell line and in N-myc-expressing cell lines. In addition, down-regulation of the N-myc promoter was relieved in the presence of TSA. Increased association of HDAC2 with the autoregulatory region within the N-myc promoter by ChIP was observed upon down-regulation of endogenous N-myc. CONCLUSIONS: The autoregulatory circuit was intact in both amplified and single-copy neuroblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, myc gene autoregulation occurred through histone deacetylation.	1

10588209	A randomized trial comparing primary angioplasty with a strategy of short-acting thrombolysis and immediate planned rescue angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction: the PACT trial. PACT investigators. Plasminogen-activator Angioplasty Compatibility Trial. OBJECTIVES: The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a short-acting reduced-dose fibrinolytic regimen to promote early infarct-related artery (IRA) patency during the inherent delay experienced by infarct patients referred for angioplasty as the principal recanalization modality. BACKGROUND: Previous approaches using long-acting, full-dose thrombolytic infusions rarely showed benefit, but they did increase adverse event rates. METHODS: Following aspirin and heparin, 606 patients were randomized to a 50-mg bolus of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (alpha half-life 4.5 min) or to placebo followed by immediate angiography with angioplasty if needed. The end points included patency rates on catheterization laboratory (cath lab) arrival, technical results when PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) was performed, complication rates, and left ventricular (LV) function by treatment assignment and time to restored patency following angioplasty. RESULTS: Patency on cath lab arrival was 61% with rt-PA (28% Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial [TIMI]-2, 33% TIMI-3), and 34% with placebo (19% TIMI-2, 15% TIMI-3) (p = 0.001). Rescue and primary PTCA restored TIMI-3 in closed arteries equally (77%, 79%). No differences were observed in stroke or major bleeding. Left ventricular function was similar in both treatment groups, but convalescent ejection fraction (EF) was highest with a patent IRA (TIMI-3) on cath lab arrival (62.4%) or when produced by angioplasty within an hour of bolus (62.5%). However, in 88% of angioplasties, the delay exceeded 1 h: convalescent EF 57.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored thrombolytic regimens compatible with subsequent interventions lead to more frequent early recanalization (before cath arrival), which facilitates greater LV function preservation with no augmentation of adverse events.	0

9293840	Completion angiography, is it really necessary? BACKGROUND: Routine completion imaging after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been advocated by many investigators to detect and repair unsuspected defects with the goal of reducing perioperative morbidity and residual disease. However, completion imaging has been performed rarely in our practice. Our carotid registry was interrogated to determine whether omitting routine completion imaging adversely affected outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of 229 consecutive CEAs performed by one vascular surgeon during 1988 to 1996 was completed. Duplex follow-up was used to identify persistent residual defects, which were classified as 50% to 74%, 75% to 99%, and occlusion in the common (CCA), internal (ICA), and external (ECA) arteries and was available in 192 cases. RESULTS: During the study period, eight completion angiograms were performed (3.5%) and 5 arteries were reopened. Combined stroke and death rate was 3.1% (7 of 229). Duplex follow-up, available on 192 patients, showed residual lesions in 29 patients (15%), but only 7 (3.6%) involving the internal or common carotid. CONCLUSION: Routine completion imaging is not required to achieve acceptable morbidity and mortality and minimize residual problems after CEA. Attention to operative details with selective imaging will give excellent results.	0
11356886	Temporary inactivation of the retrosplenial cortex causes a transient reorganization of spatial coding in the hippocampus. The ability to navigate accurately is dependent on the integration of visual and movement-related cues. Navigation based on metrics derived from movement is referred to as path integration. Recent theories of navigation have suggested that posterior cortical areas, the retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortex, are involved in path integration during navigation. In support of this hypothesis, we have found previously that temporary inactivation of retrosplenial cortex results in dark-selective impairments on the radial maze (Cooper and Mizumori, 1999). To understand further the role of the retrosplenial cortex in navigation, we combined temporary inactivation of retrosplenial cortex with recording of complex spike cells in the hippocampus. Thus, behavioral performance during spatial memory testing could be compared with place-field responses before, and during, inactivation of retrosplenial cortex. In the first experiment, behavioral results confirmed that inactivation of retrosplenial cortex only impairs radial maze performance in darkness when animals are at asymptote levels of performance. A second experiment revealed that retrosplenial cortex inactivation impaired spatial learning during initial light training. In both experiments, the normal location of hippocampal \"place fields\" was changed by temporary inactivation of retrosplenial cortex, whereas other electrophysiological properties of the cells were not affected. The changes in place coding occurred in the presence, and absence, of behavioral impairments. We suggest that the retrosplenial cortex provides mnemonic spatial information for updating location codes in the hippocampus, thereby facilitating accurate path integration. In this way, the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus may be part of an interactive neural system that mediates navigation.	0
9153465	Dementia after stroke increases the risk of long-term stroke recurrence. BACKGROUND: Although risk factors for first stroke have been identified, the predictors of long-term stroke recurrence are less well understood. We performed the present study to determine whether dementia diagnosed three months after stroke onset is an independent risk factor for long-term stroke recurrence. METHODS: We examined 242 patients (age = 72.0 +/- 8.7 years) hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke who had survived the first three months without recurrence and followed them to identify predictors of long-term stroke recurrence. We diagnosed dementia three months after stroke using modified DSM-III-R criteria based on neuropsychological and functional assessments. The effects of conventional stroke risk factors and dementia status on survival free of recurrence were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analyses, and the relative risks (RR) of recurrence were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Dementia (RR = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.36 to 5.42); cardiac disease (RR = 2.18, CI = 1.15 to 4.12); and sex, with women at higher risk (RR = 2.03, CI = 1.01 to 4.10), were significant independent predictors of recurrence, while education (RR = 1.90, CI = 0.77 to 4.68), admission systolic blood pressure >160 mm Hg (RR = 1.80, CI = 0.94 to 3.44) and alcohol intake exceeding 160 grams per week (RR = 1.86, CI = 0.79 to 4.38) were weakly related. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that dementia significantly increases the risk of long-term stroke recurrence, with additional independent contributions by cardiac disease and sex. Cognitive impairment may be a surrogate marker for multiple vascular risk factors and larger infarct volume that may serve to increase the risk of recurrence. Alternatively, less aggressive medical management of stroke patients with cognitive impairment or noncompliance of such patients with medical therapy may be bases for an increased rate of stroke recurrence.	0
15945545	[Donor activity of methicillin resistant staphylococci in transduction experiments]. Antibiotic resistance gene transmission from methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), isolated in a burn care unit, was studied in transduction experiments with type phages 29, 52, 52A and in experiments with prophage induction. The results of the experiments demonstrated high donor activity of MRSA. Recombinants with different antibiotic resistance phenotypes were revealed, but there were no methicillin resistant staphylococci among them. Stability of cloramphenicol resistance gene transmission in the experiments on specific transduction with the prophage induction could be indicative of the prophage localization near the chloramphenicol resistance genes. Variety of the antibiotic resistance combinations in the transductants from the clinical strains of MRSA could prove heterogeneity of the strains even under conditions of one hospital.	0

9751113	Preventing Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Strategy for the 21st Century. Overview of the Updated CDC plan. Societal, technological, and environmental factors continue to have a dramatic effect on infectious diseases worldwide, facilitating the emergence of new diseases and the reemergence of old ones, sometimes in drug-resistant forms. Modern demographic and ecologic conditions that favor the spread of infectious diseases include rapid population growth; increasing poverty and urban migration; more frequent movement across international boundaries by tourists, workers, immigrants, and refugees; alterations in the habitats of animals and arthropods that transmit disease; increasing numbers of persons with impaired host defenses; and changes in the way that food is processed and distributed. Several recent health events underscore the need for a public health system ready to address whatever disease problems that might arise. For example, in 1997, an avian strain of influenza that had never before infected humans began to kill previously healthy persons in Hong Kong, and strains of Sta phylococcus aureus with diminished susceptibility to the antibiotic vancomycin were reported in Japan and the United States. In addition, researchers recently discovered that a strain of the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had been infecting humans for at least 20 years before AIDS emerged as a worldwide epidemic. Preventing Emerging Infectious Diseases: A Strategy for the 21st Century describes CDC's plan to combat today's infectious diseases and prevent those of tomorrow. It represents the second phase of the effort launched in 1994 with the publication of CDC's Addressing Emerging Infectious Disease Threats: A Prevention Strategy for the United States. This overview of the updated plan outlines specific objectives under four major goals: a) surveillance and response, b) applied research, c) infrastructure and training, and d) prevention and control. Achieving these objectives will enhance understanding of infectious diseases and bolster their detection, control, and prevention. The plan also targets nine categories of problems that cause human suffering and place a burden on society. The aim of this plan is to build a stronger, more flexible U.S. public health system that is well-prepared to respond to known disease problems, as well as to address the unexpected, whether it be an influenza pandemic, a disease caused by an unknown organism, or a bioterrorist attack. The implementation of this plan will require the dedicated efforts of many partners, including state and local health departments, other federal agencies, professional societies, universities, research institutes, health-care providers and organizations, the World Health Organization, and many other domestic and international organizations and groups.	0
11724422	Mortality of patients with childhood onset (0-17 years) Type I diabetes in Israel: a population-based study. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to examine the mortality rate of subjects with childhood-onset Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus in Israel. METHODS: The whole-country cohort of 1,861 children and adolescents (0-17 years) with Type I diabetes, diagnosed between January 1965 and December 1993 in Israel, was analysed for mortality up to October 1996. RESULTS: A total of 37 deaths were identified with an ascertainment rate of 100%. There was a significant (p < 0.001) excess mortality in the patients with Type I diabetes, the standard mortality ratio being three times higher than that of the general population. The causes of mortality were ketoacidosis (n = 8), infections (n = 8), chronic diabetes complications (n = 9), external causes (n = 6) and other (n = 6). Among the subjects who died, the prevalence of nephropathy, neuropathy and anaemia was higher in female than in male subjects. A total of 17 of the patients with diabetes who died had a central nervous disease (psychosis, mental retardation, epilepsy). There was a trend to lower mortality among the Arab cohort which did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data provide additional evidence that childhood-onset Type I diabetes carries an increased mortality risk when compared with the mortality risk of the non-diabetic population.	0
8296580	The impact of availability, attraction and lethality of suicide methods on suicide rates in Germany. Substantial fluctuations have prevailed in both the rate and particular methods of suicide in the Federal Republic of Germany during the past 40 years. The current study examines the extent to which the availability, attraction and lethality of particular methods of suicide affect suicide rates. A close relationship existed in the period from 1949 and 1989 between the peaks of the suicide rate and the percentage of low threshold suicide methods according to De Catanzaro, whereby suicide in this context is understood to mean suicide by shooting or intake of solid, liquid or gaseous poisons. Our hypothetically expected lesser compensation between high and low threshold methods for women was confirmed. Between 1963 and 1976 the rate of suicide committed using domestic gas receded dramatically. Within the same period, however, the rate of suicide committed using other poisons rose accordingly.	0

8004950	Adolescent contraceptive counseling and gynecology: a deficiency in pediatric office-based care. With the large and increasing numbers of sexually active adolescents, pediatricians must learn to deal with the issues of adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). This is particularly true at a time when health care reform will encourage primary care physicians to assume a greater role in general medical management of their patients. One hundred Connecticut general practice pediatricians were randomly selected to examine the frequency, level of comfort, and rationale for involvement regarding sexual history taking, contraceptive counseling, and performance of pelvic examinations. This represents 9% of all Connecticut pediatricians. The response rate was 54%. The results were as follows: Seventy-nine percent of responding pediatricians counseled on STDs, 39% counseled on family planning, and only 62% almost always took a sexual history from the their adolescent patients, ages 10 and up. Thirty-one percent of respondents stated they would refer a male inquiring about contraception to a family planning clinic. Thirty-eight percent never do pelvic examinations on their sexually active adolescent patients. Connecticut pediatricians are providing adolescents with counseling on other high-risk behaviors such as drug and alcohol use, but provide inadequate care related to adolescent sexual activity.	0

20031953	Opioid-induced hyperalgesia in a mice model of orthopaedic pain: preventive effect of ketamine. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the preventative effect of ketamine on the exaggerated postoperative pain observed in sufentanil-treated mice and its ability to improve the analgesic effectiveness of morphine during the postoperative period in an orthopaedic model of pain. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the effects of ketamine on sufentanil enhancement of pain behaviour induced by fracture and the effects of ketamine on postoperative morphine-induced analgesia. Three tests were used to assess pain behaviour: von Frey filament application, hot-plate test, and a subjective pain scale. RESULTS: When administered 1 day after surgery in mice treated with sufentanil on D0 (before surgery), morphine induced an analgesic effect as observed by the nociceptive threshold increase in saline- and ketamine-treated mice. Morphine was more effective in ketamine-treated (1 and 50 mg kg(-1)) mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pre-emptive use of ketamine is useful in orthopaedic surgery in this mice model to diminish short- and long-term hyperalgesia, but also to improve morphine effectiveness leading to a better mobilization and more rapid rehabilitation.	0

19796181	Interleukin-10 secretion from CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells is downregulated in patients with acne vulgaris. BACKGROUND: Acne is a common chronic inflammatory dermatosis of the pilosebaceous unit. It is characterized by seborrhoea, comedone formation and an inflammatory response consistent with defective cellular immunity to Propionibacterium acnes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the immune reactivity of patients with acne compared with healthy controls by examining the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to stimulation with P. acnes. Particular focus was placed upon measuring the production of interleukin (IL)-10, which has an established immunoregulatory role. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Venous blood was collected from 47 patients with acne and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with no prior history of acne. PBMCs were cultured and their cytokine response to P. acnes investigated. RESULTS: Proinflammatory IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion from PBMCs was higher in patients with acne when stimulated with P. acnes. In contrast, a statistically significant reduction in PBMC secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in patients with acne was identified. The impaired production of IL-10 by PBMCs from patients with acne was confined to CD14+ cells presumed to be monocytes. The ability of CD14 cells from patients with acne to phagocytose P. acnes bacteria was also observed to be defective but the addition of exogenous IL-10 to PBMC cultures restored phagocytic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that patients with acne have a proinflammatory cytokine milieu and crucially are unable to contain early inflammatory changes due to a specific defect in immunosurveillance, namely low monocyte IL-10 production. Our observations raise the possibility that acne therapeutics might profitably target IL-10 both as a regulator of proinflammatory cytokines and in augmenting the CD14+ cell phagocytic response.	0
16608011	[Omega-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular diseases]. Most--but not all--epidemiological studies have demonstrated that omega-3 intake, either from nutrition or supplementation, reduces cardiovascular risk. A few intervention studies have shown a reduction of studden death in patients followed after a myocardial infarction. However EBM studies from the Cochrane Library do not confirm the real advantage of omega-3 in any group of subjects. Probably, the most interesting prescription of omega-3 supplementations would benefit to the patients after myocardial infarction, in addition to drugs that have proved their efficacy (aspirine, beta-blocker statin and ACE inhibitor).	0
19222587	Determinants of phase variation rate and the fitness implications of differing rates for bacterial pathogens and commensals. Phase variation (PV) of surface molecules and other phenotypes is a major adaptive strategy of pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Phase variants are produced at high frequencies and in a reversible manner by hypermutation or hypervariable methylation in specific regions of the genome. The major mechanisms of PV involve site-specific recombination, homologous recombination, simple sequence DNA repeat tracts or epigenetic modification by the dam methylase. PV rates of some of these mechanisms are subject to the influence of genome maintenance pathways such as DNA replication, recombination and repair while others are independent of these pathways. For each of these mechanisms, the rate of generation of phase variants is controlled by intrinsic and dispensable factors. These factors can impart environmental regulation on switching rates while many factors are subject to heterogeneity both within isolates of a species and between species. A major gap in our understanding is whether these environmental and epidemiological variations in PV rate have a major impact on fitness. Experimental approaches to studying the biological relevance of differing PV rates are being developed, and a recent intriguing finding is of a co-ordination of switching rates in the phase variable P-pili of uropathogenic bacteria.	0

18950045	Species composition and seasonal occurrence of Phyllophaga (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) infesting intensely managed Bermudagrass in Oklahoma. Larvae of Phyllophaga spp. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important turfgrass pests in many regions of the United States. However, not all of the species associated with turfgrass are known, including species most likely to be of economic concern in Oklahoma turfgrasses, especially Bermuda grass. This study documented the species composition and seasonal occurrence of Phyllophaga associated with high maintenance Bermuda grass turf in Oklahoma over a 2-yr period. In 2005 and 2006, adult Phyllophaga spp. were collected with blacklight traps from selected golf courses throughout Oklahoma Phyllophaga larvae were obtained from Bermuda grass stands at selected sod production facilities adjacent to or near the light traps. We collected 20 species of Phyllophaga beetles in light traps, and nine species of Phyllophaga larvae from turfgrass. Peak flight periods for most species occurred in May and June, but some were captured as early as mid-April and others as late as September. The cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene from adults and larvae was amplified using polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and then used to compare larval DNA against DNA from identified adults. These results confirmed the validity of using COI sequences to identify species of some Phyllophaga larvae. The identifications will aid in optimizing the timing of insecticide applications against Phyllophaga white grubs as discussed.	0

9850135	Heterogeneity of the baseline risk within patient populations of clinical trials: a proposed evaluation algorithm. In this paper, the authors present an evaluation algorithm for systematic assessment of the observed heterogeneity in disease risk within trial populations. Predictive models are used to estimate the predicted patient hazards, the odds of having an event in the upper risk quartile (ODU) and the lower risk quartile (ODL), and the odds ratio (rate ratio for time-to-event analyses) for having an event in the upper risk quartile versus the lower risk quartile (extreme quartile odds ratio (EQuOR) and extreme quartile rate ratio (EQuRR)). The ranges for these metrics depend on the extent to which predictors of the outcome of interest exist and are known and the extent to which data are collected in the trial, as well as on the eligibility criteria and the specific patients who are actually enrolled. ODU, ODL, and EQuOR values are used to systematically interpret the results for patients at different levels of risk, to evaluate generalizability, and to determine the need for subgroup analyses. Individual data for five outcomes from three trials (n = 842, 913, and 1,001, respectively) are used as examples. Observed EQuOR values ranged from 1.5 (very little predicted heterogeneity) to 59 (large heterogeneity). EQuRR values ranged from 2 to 46. ODU values ranged from 0.24 to 3.19 (generally high risk), and ODL values ranged from 0.01 (clinically negligible risk) to 0.16 (clinically meaningful risk). The algorithm may also be used for comparing diverse trials (e.g., in meta-analyses) and used prospectively for designing future trials, as shown in simulations.	0

9106661	Positive cross-regulation and enhancer sharing: two mechanisms for specifying overlapping Hox expression patterns. Vertebrate Hox genes display nested and overlapping patterns of expression. During mouse hindbrain development, Hoxb3 and Hoxb4 share an expression domain caudal to the boundary between rhombomeres 6 and 7. Transgenic analysis reveals that an enhancer (CR3) is shared between both genes and specifies this domain of overlap. Both the position of CR3 within the complex and its sequence are conserved from fish to mammals, suggesting it has a common role in regulating the vertebrate HoxB complex. CR3 mediates transcriptional activation by multiple Hox genes, including Hoxb4, Hoxd4, and Hoxb5 but not Hoxb1. It also functions as a selective HOX response element in Drosophila, where activation depends on Deformed, Sex combs reduced, and Antennapedia but not labial. Taken together, these data show that a Deformed/Hoxb4 autoregulatory loop has been conserved between mouse and Drosophila. In addition, these studies reveal the existence of positive cross-regulation and enhancer sharing as two mechanisms for reinforcing the overlapping expression domains of vertebrate Hox genes. In contrast, Drosophila Hox genes do not appear to share enhancers and where they overlap in expression, negative cross-regulatory interactions are observed. Therefore, despite many well documented aspects of Hox structural and functional conservation, there are mechanistic differences in Hox complex regulation between arthropods and vertebrates.	0
10329662	Cloning and characterization of a novel zinc finger transcriptional repressor. A direct role of the zinc finger motif in repression. We have identified a novel transcriptional repressor, AEBP2, that binds to a regulatory sequence (termed AE-1) located in the proximal promoter region of the aP2 gene that encodes the adipose fatty acid-binding protein. Sequence analysis of AEBP2 cDNA revealed that it encodes a protein containing three Gli-Kr  ppel (Cys2-His2)-type zinc fingers. Northern blot analysis revealed two transcripts (4.5 and 3.5 kilobases) which were ubiquitously expressed in every mouse tissue examined. In co-transfection assays, AEBP2 repressed transcription from the homologous aP2 promoter containing multiple copies of the AE-1 sequence. Moreover, a chimeric construct encoding a fusion AEBP2 protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain was able to repress the transcriptional activity of a heterologous promoter containing the Gal4-binding sequence. The transcriptional repression function of AEBP2 was completely abolished when one of the conserved histidine residues and a flanking serine residue in the middle zinc finger were replaced with an arginine residue. The defective transcriptional repression function of the mutant derivative was due neither to lack of expression nor to a failure to localize to the nucleus. Moreover, both the wild-type and mutant derivative of either the histidine-tagged recombinant AEBP2 proteins or the in vitro translated Gal4-AEBP2 fusion proteins were equally able to bind to the target DNA. These results suggest that a portion of the zinc finger structure may play a direct role in transcriptional repression function, but not in DNA binding.	1
8642214	CD4+ T-cell responses to recombinant hsp65 and hsp18 of M. leprae and their trypsin-digested fragments in leprosy: diversity in HLA-DR restriction. Mycobacterium leprae heat-shock proteins hsp65 and hsp18 have received immense attention as major T-cell target antigens in leprosy. Both of these hsps and their tryptic fragments were characterized for their ability to stimulate CD4+ T cells derived from polar leprosy cases and healthy contacts. The optimal digestion of hsps with trypsin yielded four fragments of hsp65--TDB65-1 (24 kDa), TDB65-2 (18 kDa), TDB65-3 (17 kDa), TDB65-4 (14 kDa)-- and three of hsp18--TDB18-1 (10 kDa), TDB18-2 (5 kDa), TDB18-3 (3 kDa). While all of these tryptic fragments and undigested hsps triggered CD4+ T cells from tuberculoid (TT) leprosy patients and healthy contacts (SI > 2), only two fragments--TDB65-2 and TDB18-3--were found to be stimulatory in anergic lepromatous (LL) leprosy patients (SI = 5.27 and 3.0, respectively). Blocking studies using allele-specific anti-DR monoclonal antibodies revealed multiple HLA-Dr restriction, with DR2 providing the strongest restriction in both TT as well as LL leprosy. These findings indicate that M. leprae hsps and their trypsin-digested fragments are promiscuous and recognizable in the context of diverse HLA alleles, of which DR2 is the most efficient restriction element. The 18-kDa fragment of hsp65 and the 3-kDa fragment of hsp18 are the most versatile fragments that could elicit in vitro proliferation in both polar forms of leprosy.	0
15515302	Postoperative residual curarisation: complication or malpractice? Neuromuscular blocking drugs are often used in anaesthesia; in some types of surgery, their continuous infusion is indicated to limit the otherwise high incidence of movement. A large amount of postoperative residual curarisation is found after a single bolus, but more especially when continuous infusions are used in healthy patients and even more so in those with organ dysfunction or undergoing special types of surgery. Therefore, one should always optimise the dose requirements over time using neuromuscular transmission monitoring. Such monitoring should also help the clinician to antagonise selectively the neuromuscular block at the end of surgery. One should probably avoid routine antagonisation, especially in certain subgroups of patients, until a selective and safe reversal agent has been developed. At present, then, the only objective and reliable guide to facilitating the decision for selective antagonisation is the neuromuscular transmission monitor. Recent data and editorials warning about postoperative residual curarisation after boluses and infusions of neuromuscular blocking drugs have made residual curarisation one of the most feared complications in anaesthesia. There may be a consequent issue of malpractice if neuromuscular transmission monitoring is not used and/or pharmacological antagonisation is not performed.	0

10433393	Age-related changes in upper extremity performance of elderly people: a longitudinal study. The objective of this research was to study age-related changes in the upper extremity performance of healthy community-dwelling elderly people, by using a longitudinal design. In 1995-1996. gross and fine manual dexterity, global performance, motor coordination, grip strength, tactile recognition, two-point discrimination, touch/pressure threshold, and tactile localization of 264 of the 360 subjects initially evaluated in 1992-1993 were reevaluated by using the same upper extremity measuring instruments. Those who did not participate (n = 96) were found to be significantly different from those who participated in the longitudinal study. Although the survivors were younger, more active, and perceived themselves in better health than the nonparticipants, their upper extremity performance significantly decreased in the 3-year period, with a few exceptions. In general, the decline was related to the initial score but not to age.	0
11317282	Localization of ulnar neuropathy with conduction block across the elbow. We performed short segment incremental stimulation on 13 consecutive patients with ulnar neuropathy across the elbow (UNE) and conduction block. Conduction block occurred proximal to the medial epicondyle in 62%, at the epicondyle in 23%, and below the elbow in 15%. The ulnar nerve may be more prone to external compression above the elbow than previously recognized. Short segment incremental studies are useful to identify conduction block above the elbow in such patients.	0
12611611	Association of selenium with thyroid volume and echostructure in 35- to 60-year-old French adults. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between selenium status, thyroid Volume and gland echostructure. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. METHODS: In 792 men (45-60 Years) and 1108 women (35-60 Years) from the SU.VI.MAX study, thyroid Volume and gland echostructure were determined ultrasonographically. At baseline, thyrotropin, free thyroxine, selenium, zinc, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, retinol, urinary iodine and thiocyanate concentrations were measured. Alcohol consumption, smoking, and menopausal status were assessed by a questionnaire. A stepwise linear and a logistic regression model were used, adjusting for antioxidant vitamins, trace elements status and age. RESULTS: In women, there was an inverse association between selenium status and thyroid Volume (P=0.003). A protective effect of selenium against goiter (odds ratio (OR)=0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.008-0.6) and thyroid tIssue damage (OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.06-0.7) was observed. There was no evidence of an association between menopausal status and other antioxidant elements, thyroid Volume or thyroid hypoechogenicity. Smoking, but not alcohol consumption, was associated with an increased risk of thyroid enlargement in women (OR=3.94, 95% CI=1.64-9.48). No association between thyroid Volume, thyroid structure or selenium was found in men. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that selenium may protect against goiter. Selenium was related to thyroid echostructure, suggesting it may also protect against autoimmune thyroid disease.	0
16163366	Randomized, multicenter trial of conventional ventilation versus high-frequency oscillatory ventilation for the early management of respiratory failure in term or near-term infants in Colombia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) compared to conventional ventilation (CV) for the treatment of respiratory failure in term and near-term infants in Colombia. STUDY DESIGN: Eligible infants with moderate to severe respiratory failure were randomized to early treatment with CV or HFOV. Ventilator management and general patient care were standardized. The main outcome was neonatal death or pulmonary air leak. RESULTS: A total of 119 infants were enrolled (55 in the HFOV group; 64 in the CV group) during the study period. Six infants in the HFOV group (11%) and two infants in the CV group (3%) developed the primary outcome (RR: 3.6, 95% CI: 0.8-16.9). Five infants in the HFOV group (9%) and one infant in the CV (2%) died before 28 days of life (RR: 5.9 CI: 0.7-48.2). Secondary outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: HFOV may not be superior to CV as an early treatment for respiratory failure in this age group. Standardization of ventilator management and general patient care may have a greater impact on the outcome in Colombia than mode of ventilation.	0
19383888	HER-2/neu overexpression as a predictor for the transition from in situ to invasive breast cancer. The clinical implications of HER-2/neu (HER2) expression in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions have yet to be clearly elucidated; this despite the more frequent expression of HER2 in high-grade DCIS lesions compared with invasive cancers. We hypothesized that HER2 overexpression in DCIS is associated with more rapid progression to invasive disease. Immunohistochemical staining for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 was done on DCIS specimens. Univariate analysis and a multivariate logistic regression were done to determine whether estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or HER2 status, comedo necrosis, nuclear grade, lesion size, or patient age predicted the presence of associated invasive disease in patients with DCIS. Invasive foci were found in association with HER2 overexpressing DCIS at a higher frequency than with DCIS that did not overexpress HER2. Although high nuclear grade, large lesion size, and HER2 overexpression were all associated with the presence of invasive disease on univariate analysis, HER2 was the only significant predictor for the presence of invasive disease after multivariate adjustment (odds ratio, 6.4; P = 0.01). These data indicate that HER2 overexpression in DCIS lesions predicts the presence of invasive foci in patients with DCIS and suggest that targeting of HER2 in an early disease setting may forestall or prevent disease progression.	0
15257876	Ultrasound in emergency patients: better detection of free intraabdominal fluids by the use of tissue harmonic imaging. BACKGROUND: Ultrasound examination is one of the main investigative procedures in emergency patients who are hospitalized due to abdominal pain. Detectable free fluid collections are important hints to the definite, sometimes life-threatening diagnosis, but their detection in cases of only small amounts is difficult to perform by conventional sonography. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report about 25 cases of patients who suffered from acute abdominal pain and who were presented as emergency patients to our department of ultrasound. First, the examination was performed by conventional sonography (3.4 MHz). Only with the additional tissue harmonic imaging (THI, 2.3 MHz, pulse inversion) thin borders of free fluids around the liver or other abdominal organs (gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bowel) could be detected leading to other important diagnostic or therapeutic steps. In this way, the diagnosis of pancreatitis, cholezystitis, peritonitis, peritoneal carcinosis, ascites (liver cirrhosis, serositis, postoperative status after laparotomy), bleeding or paralytic ileus could be elucidated. CONCLUSION: THI sonography improves the detection of small amounts of free abdominal fluid collections. Therefore, this technique is helpful in the diagnostic procedure of emergency patients.	0
15326283	Altered ionization of the B13 Glu in insulin B9 and B10 mutants: a computational analysis. An experimentally determined pK(a) change of +2.50 units has been reported for the B13 Glu residue in a dimeric B9 Ser --> Asp insulin mutant relative to the native dimer. Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics-based pK(a) calculations were performed to probe the effect of the B9 Ser --> Asp and B10 His --> Asp mutations on aggregation and the ionization behaviour of the B13 carboxylate. The method produced shifts of +2.64 and +2.45 units for the pK(a) shift of the two B13 residues in the B9 mutant dimer relative to the wild-type dimer, which is in good agreement with the experimental value (<6% error). The calculations also suggest that the reason neither mutant insulin can aggregate into hexamers is the resultant crowding of negatively charged groups in the central solvent channel on hexamer formation. In the wild-type insulin, binding of zinc ions by B10 His overcomes this problem, whereas in the B10 mutant this possibility is ruled out by the absence of the zinc binding site. A series of mutations are predicted to stabilize the medically relevant, monomeric form of insulin.	0
11171467	[Morphology of peripheral nerves, their sheaths, and their vascularization]. This review aims to update our understanding of peripheral nerves, including the nature and function of their sheaths and, finally, their vascularization. The peripheral nervous system is made up of nerves whose function is to gather stimuli from the periphery as well as to transport the motor, secretory or vegetative responses that are triggered to the periphery. The connective tissue surrounding peripheral nerves all along their extension is made up of endoneurial, perineurial and epineurial. The endoneurium surrounds individual axons, which are grouped in fasciculi, each of which is surrounded by the perineurium and finally, the group of fasciculi that comprise all the axons present in this nerve are surrounded by the epineurium. Axons form an intraneural plexus such that they occupy positions in the various fasciculi along the trajectory of the plexus. The number and size of fasciculi vary along the trajectory of a nerve as a result of the plexus positioning of the axons. Peripheral nerves are richly vascularized throughout their length, with multiple anastomoses forming the intraneural vascular network, which is made up mainly of arterioles, capillaries, postcapillary venules and venules. Regarding the blood-nerve barrier and the existence of capillary permeability: endoneural capillaries have junctions that are stronger than those of the endothelial cells of vessels in the epineurium and perineurium. Two distinct lymph channels networks are present in the peripheral nerve stems and are separated by the perineural barrier. The nervi-nervorum are special nerves of a sympathetic and sensory nature that arise from the nerve itself and the perivascular plexuses.	0
12755626	Amphotericin B binds to amyloid fibrils and delays their formation: a therapeutic mechanism? The membrane-active antifungal agent amphotericin B (AmB) is one of the few agents shown to slow the course of prion diseases in animals. Congo Red and other small molecules have been reported to directly inhibit amyloidogenesis in both prion and Alzheimer peptide model systems via specific binding. We propose that it is possible that AmB may act similarly to physically prevent conversion of the largely alpha-helical prion protein (PrP) to the pathological beta-sheet aggregate protease-resistant isoform (PrP(res)) in prion disease and by analogy prevent fibrillization in amyloid diseases. To assess whether AmB is capable of binding specifically to amyloid fibrils as does Congo Red, we have used the insulin fibril and Abeta 25-35 amyloid model fibril system. We find that AmB does bind strongly to both insulin (K(d) = 1.1 microM) and Abeta 25-35 amyloid (K(d) = 6.4 microM) fibrils but not to native insulin. Binding is characterized by a red-shifted AmB spectrum indicative of a more hydrophobic environment. Thus AmB seems to have a complementary face for amyloid fibrils but not the native protein. In addition, AmB interacts specifically with Congo Red, a known fibril-binding agent. In kinetic fibril formation studies, AmB was able to significantly kinetically delay the formation of Abeta 25-35 fibrils at pH 7.4 but not insulin fibrils at pH 2.	0

7760812	Molecular characterization of a novel transcription factor that controls stromelysin expression. Stromelysins, which are the metalloproteinases with the widest substrate specificities, play a critical role in tumor invasion and metastasis. We have previously reported an element (SPRE) of the stromelysin promoter located between nucleotides -1221 and -1203 that is necessary and sufficient for the control of stromelysin gene expression by mitogenic activation, which induces a nuclear activity that binds to this sequence. Using a concatenated probe with several copies of this element to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library from mouse Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, we report here the molecular cloning of a cDNA coding for a novel protein (SPBP) of 937 amino acids that binds to this element and has several features of a transcription factor, such as a putative leucine zipper region, a nuclear localization signal, and a basic domain with homology to the DNA-binding domains of Fos and Jun. Evidence that SPBP is at least a critical component of the mitogen-induced SPRE nuclear binding activity is presented here. Furthermore, the transfection of an expression plasmid for SPBP transactivates reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids containing either the full-length stromelysin promoter or a single copy of the SPRE cloned upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter. Therefore, the results presented here identify a novel transcription factor critically involved in the control of stromelysin expression.	1

23743924	Evolution of the genetic code by incorporation of amino acids that improved or changed protein function. Fifty years have passed since the genetic code was deciphered, but how the genetic code came into being has not been satisfactorily addressed. It is now widely accepted that the earliest genetic code did not encode all 20 amino acids found in the universal genetic code as some amino acids have complex biosynthetic pathways and likely were not available from the environment. Therefore, the genetic code evolved as pathways for synthesis of new amino acids became available. One hypothesis proposes that early in the evolution of the genetic code four amino acids-valine, alanine, aspartic acid, and glycine-were coded by GNC codons (N  =  any base) with the remaining codons being nonsense codons. The other sixteen amino acids were subsequently added to the genetic code by changing nonsense codons into sense codons for these amino acids. Improvement in protein function is presumed to be the driving force behind the evolution of the code, but how improved function was achieved by adding amino acids has not been examined. Based on an analysis of amino acid function in proteins, an evolutionary mechanism for expansion of the genetic code is described in which individual coded amino acids were replaced by new amino acids that used nonsense codons differing by one base change from the sense codons previously used. The improved or altered protein function afforded by the changes in amino acid function provided the selective advantage underlying the expansion of the genetic code. Analysis of amino acid properties and functions explains why amino acids are found in their respective positions in the genetic code.	0
8264531	Resolution of four large chromosomes in penicillin-producing filamentous fungi: the penicillin gene cluster is located on chromosome II (9.6 Mb) in Penicillium notatum and chromosome I (10.4 Mb) in Penicillium chrysogenum. Four chromosomes were resolved by pulsed field gel electrophoresis in Penicillium notatum (10.8, 9.6, 6.3 and 5.4 Mb in size) and in five different strains of Penicillium chrysogenum (10.4, 9.6, 7.3 and 6.8 Mb in the wild type). Small differences in size were found between the four chromosomes of the five P. chrysogenum strains. The penicillin gene cluster was localized by hybridization with a pcbAB probe to chromosome II of P. notatum and to chromosome I of all P. chrysogenum strains except the deletion mutant P. chrysogenum npe10, which lacks this DNA region. The pyrG gene was localized to chromosome I in P. notatum and to chromosome II in all P. chrysogenum strains except in the mutant AS-P-78 where the probe hybridized to chromosome III. A major chromosomal rearrangement seems to have occurred in this high penicillin producing strain. A fast moving DNA band observed in all gels corresponds to mitochondrial DNA. The total genome size has been calculated as 32.1 Mb in P. notatum and 34.1 Mb for the P. chrysogenum strains.	0
10811431	Search for retrogressive reactions accompanying demineralization in native and air-oxidized coals. This solid state 13C NMR study confirms, for coals, and extends, for air-oxidized coals, the claim that the Bishop and Ward strong aqueous-acid coal demineralization procedure [M. Bishop, D.L. Ward, Fuel 37 (1958) 191.] does not lead to the formation of detectable levels of cross-links in the organic matrix of these materials. The study was prompted by the demonstration that polymerization accompanies strong acid demineralization in lignin, and the recognition that the chemical environment created in air-oxidized coals contains introduced reactive functionality similar to that in the lignin. In particular, both contain oxidized benzylic carbon functionality that can undergo acid-catalyzed polymerization reactions. For two coals of differing rank, no acid-induced cross-link formation has been observed in the pristine or air-oxidized coals, within the 5 parts per thousand (ppt) sensitivity of the NMR technique used in this study.	0
21698415	Combined therapy with 131I and retinoic acid in Korean patients with radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcome of redifferentiation therapy using retinoic acid (RA) in combination with 131I therapy, and to identify biological parameters that predict therapeutic response in Korean patients with radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 patients (13 men, 34 women; age 54.2  13.6 years) with radioiodine-refractory PTC underwent therapy consisting of consecutive treatment with 131I and RA. Each 131I/RA treatment cycle involved the administration of oral isotretinoin for 6 weeks at 1-1.5 mg/kg daily followed by a single oral dose of 131I (range 5.5-16.7 GBq). Therapeutic responses were determined using serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels and the change in tumour size 6 months after completing the 131I/RA therapy. Biological parameters and pathological parameters before and after combined therapy were compared. RESULTS: After completing 131I/RA therapy, 1 patient showed a complete response, 9 partial response, 9 stable disease, and 28 progressive disease, representing an overall response rate of 21.3%. Univariate analysis revealed that an age of <45 years and a persistently high serum Tg level were related to a good response. No clinical response was achieved when metastases showing no iodine uptake were present. Multivariate regression analysis showed that an age of <45 years was significantly associated with a good response. Of the 24 patients with well-differentiated carcinoma, 5 (20.8%) responded to 131I/RA therapy, whereas all 6 patients with poorly differentiated carcinoma failed to respond. CONCLUSION: 131I/RA therapy was found to elicit a response rate of 21.3% among patients with radioiodine-refractory PTC, and an age of <45 years was found to be significantly associated with a good response.	0
22287579	Prevalence of laryngopharyngeal reflux symptoms: comparison between health checkup examinees and patients with otitis media. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) symptoms in health checkup examinees and in patients with otitis media with effusion (OME) of undetermined etiology and the significance of age, body mass index (BMI), and pepsinogen (PG) concentration in middle ear effusions (MEEs). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Health checkup and private clinics. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 410 subjects who had undergone a health checkup were asked to respond to the reflux symptom index (RSI) to identify the distribution of the RSI score, and the results were compared with 62 patients with OME by BMI and PG concentration in the MEEs. RESULTS: The RSI-positive (score >13) rate was 7.1% in the health checkup examinees. The highest rate was observed in men in their 40s, who had the highest average BMI. None of the men in their 80s were RSI positive. The RSI-positive rate in patients with OME was 21.0%. None of the male patients >=  70 years of age were RSI positive, whereas the average PG concentration was significantly higher in this group. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of LPR symptoms evaluated by the RSI was significantly higher in OME patients than in the health checkup examinees; however, a similar pattern in which LPR symptoms were prominent in middle-aged men with a high BMI and much less in elderly men was observed. Middle-aged men with a high BMI might be diagnosed as having LPR disease based on the relevant symptoms. LPR findings would be more sensitive than symptoms in elderly men.	0
15938344	'Double' teeth-a diagnostic conundrum. A 'double' tooth is an uncommon dental developmental anomaly that can occur in the deciduous and/or permanent dentition. It is not always possible to differentiate clinically between fusion and gemination. Clinical and radiographic examination, as well as a histological assessment, can help to differentiate between fusion and gemination. A case of fusion in the deciduous dentition is presented to demonstrate the diagnostic differences but also, more importantly, to draw attention to the potential impact of 'double' teeth on the developing secondary dentition and its future management.	0
15024058	Inhibition of Mist1 homodimer formation induces pancreatic acinar-to-ductal metaplasia. The pancreas consists of three main cell lineages (endocrine, exocrine, and duct) that develop from common primitive foregut precursors. The transcriptional network responsible for endocrine cell development has been studied extensively, but much less is known about the transcription factors that maintain the exocrine and duct cell lineages. One transcription factor that may be important to exocrine cell function is Mist1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor that is expressed in acinar cells. In order to perform a molecular characterization of this protein, we employed coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, coupled with electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies, to show that Mist1 exists in vivo as a homodimer complex. Analysis of transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative Mist1 transgene (Mist1(mutant basic) [Mist1(MB)]) revealed the cell autonomous effect of inhibiting endogenous Mist1. Mist1(MB) cells become disorganized, exhibit a severe depletion of intercellular gap junctions, and express high levels of the glycoprotein clusterin, which has been shown to demarcate immature acinar cells. Inhibition of Mist1 transcriptional activity also leads to activation of duct-specific genes, such as cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 20, suggesting that alterations in the bHLH network produce a direct acinar-to-ductal phenotypic switch in mature cells. We propose that Mist1 is a key transcriptional regulator of exocrine pancreatic cells and that in the absence of functional Mist1, acinar cells do not maintain their normal identity.	1
15265330	Online adaptive decision trees. Decision trees and neural networks are widely used tools for pattern classification. Decision trees provide highly localized representation, whereas neural networks provide a distributed but compact representation of the decision space. Decision trees cannot be induced in the online mode, and they are not adaptive to changing environment, whereas neural networks are inherently capable of online learning and adpativity. Here we provide a classification scheme called online adaptive decision trees (OADT), which is a tree-structured network like the decision trees and capable of online learning like neural networks. A new objective measure is derived for supervised learning with OADT. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed classification scheme. Also, with certain real-life data sets, we find that OADT performs better than two widely used models: the hierarchical mixture of experts and multilayer perceptron.	0
22973447	Differential activities of the two closely related withanolides, Withaferin A and Withanone: bioinformatics and experimental evidences. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Withanolides are naturally occurring chemical compounds. They are secondary metabolites produced via oxidation of steroids and structurally consist of a steroid-backbone bound to a lactone or its derivatives. They are known to protect plants against herbivores and have medicinal value including anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, adaptogenic and anti-oxidant effects. Withaferin A (Wi-A) and Withanone (Wi-N) are two structurally similar withanolides isolated from Withania somnifera, also known as Ashwagandha in Indian Ayurvedic medicine. Ashwagandha alcoholic leaf extract (i-Extract), rich in Wi-N, was shown to kill cancer cells selectively. Furthermore, the two closely related purified phytochemicals, Wi-A and Wi-N, showed differential activity in normal and cancer human cells in vitro and in vivo. We had earlier identified several genes involved in cytotoxicity of i-Extract in human cancer cells by loss-of-function assays using either siRNA or randomized ribozyme library. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we have employed bioinformatics tools on four genes, i.e., mortalin, p53, p21 and Nrf2, identified by loss-of-function screenings. We examined the docking efficacy of Wi-N and Wi-A to each of the four targets and found that the two closely related phytochemicals have differential binding properties to the selected cellular targets that can potentially instigate differential molecular effects. We validated these findings by undertaking parallel experiments on specific gene responses to either Wi-N or Wi-A in human normal and cancer cells. We demonstrate that Wi-A that binds strongly to the selected targets acts as a strong cytotoxic agent both for normal and cancer cells. Wi-N, on the other hand, has a weak binding to the targets; it showed milder cytotoxicity towards cancer cells and was safe for normal cells. The present molecular docking analyses and experimental evidence revealed important insights to the use of Wi-A and Wi-N for cancer treatment and development of new anti-cancer phytochemical cocktails.	0
10115708	Reactions of beginning counselors to situations involving death and dying. It has commonly been assumed by thanatologists that client problems centering on death and dying are particularly demanding and difficult for the mental health professional. The present study tested this assumption by asking 81 beginning counselors to rate their degree of comfort with 15 counseling scenarios, 5 of which involved death or loss (e.g., terminal illness, suicide, AIDS, grief) and 10 of which concerned other focal issues (e.g., rape, marital problems). As predicted, counselors rated situations involving death and dying as substantially more uncomfortable than other presenting problems. However, counselors' levels of experience and personal death threat were unrelated to their response to death situations, leaving the cause of their discomfort with such situations unexplained.	0
10224572	Heart rate variability in severe aortic stenosis. BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Autonomic dysfunction may be a risk factor for the generation of arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with severe aortic stenosis; thus, patients with this condition were studied to assess cardiac autonomic function. METHODS: Twelve patients (five males, seven females; mean age 63 +/- 13 years) with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis before and after aortic valve replacement, were compared with a control group matched by age and sex. In the study group, mean fractional shortening was 36.5 +/- 5% and maximal aortic gradient 94.7 +/- 12 mmHg, assessed echocardiographically. Autonomic dysfunction was evaluated by following heart rate variability in both time and frequency domains. Spectral analysis was assessed at very low frequency (VLF: 0.017-0.05 Hz), low frequency (LF: 0.05-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF: 0.15-0.50 Hz). Heart rate variability was analyzed during three intervals, between 6:00-8:00 am (morning), 14:00-16:00 (afternoon) and 02:00-04:00 (night), and re-evaluated at 8-10 months after aortic valve replacement. RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with aortic stenosis presented a significantly lower heart rate variability in the morning and afternoon, analyzed either by time or frequency domain: 50 +/- 22 versus 132 +/- 52 ms (p < 0.05); VLF 5.0 +/- 1.5 versus 7.9 +/- 1.4 ln (ms)2 (p < 0.05); LF 4.9 +/- 1.7 versus 7.5 +/- 1.8 ln (ms)2 (p < 0.05); HF 5.3 +/- 1.4 versus 7.5 +/- 1.8 ln (ms)2 (p < 0.05). Results at night showed a similar tendency, but were not statistically significantly different. At 8-10 months after aortic valve replacement, heart rate variability was increased significantly during the morning, from 50 +/- 22 to 79.5 +/- 22 ms (p < 0.05); VLF from 5.0 +/- 1.5 to 6.7 +/- 0.8 ln (ms)2 (p < 0.05); LF from 4.9 +/- 1.7 to 6.2 +/- 1.3 ln (ms)2 (p < 0.05). HF values tended to increase, though not significantly so. During the remainder of the day there was also a non-statistically significant increment in all values of heart rate variability. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis present with autonomic dysfunction that tends to normalize within the first year of valve replacement.	0
18462196	Parasites in food webs: the ultimate missing links. Parasitism is the most common consumer strategy among organisms, yet only recently has there been a call for the inclusion of infectious disease agents in food webs. The value of this effort hinges on whether parasites affect food-web properties. Increasing evidence suggests that parasites have the potential to uniquely alter food-web topology in terms of chain length, connectance and robustness. In addition, parasites might affect food-web stability, interaction strength and energy flow. Food-web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live. Empirically, incorporating parasites into food webs is straightforward. We may start with existing food webs and add parasites as nodes, or we may try to build food webs around systems for which we already have a good understanding of infectious processes. In the future, perhaps researchers will add parasites while they construct food webs. Less clear is how food-web theory can accommodate parasites. This is a deep and central problem in theoretical biology and applied mathematics. For instance, is representing parasites with complex life cycles as a single node equivalent to representing other species with ontogenetic niche shifts as a single node? Can parasitism fit into fundamental frameworks such as the niche model? Can we integrate infectious disease models into the emerging field of dynamic food-web modelling? Future progress will benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and infectious disease biologists.	0
17180468	A cross-linguistic speech error investigation of functional complexity. This work is a systematic, cross-linguistic examination of speech errors in English, Hindi, Japanese, Spanish and Turkish. It first describes a methodology for the generation of parallel corpora of error data, then uses these data to examine three general hypotheses about the relationship between language structure and the speech production system. All of the following hypotheses were supported by the data. Languages are equally complex. No overall differences were found in the numbers of errors made by speakers of the five languages in the study. Languages are processed in similar ways. English-based generalizations about language production were tested to see to what extent they would hold true across languages. It was found that, to a large degree, languages follow similar patterns. However, the relative numbers of phonological anticipations and perseverations in other languages did not follow the English pattern. Languages differ in that speech errors tend to cluster around loci of complexity within each language. Languages such as Turkish and Spanish, which have more inflectional morphology, exhibit more errors involving inflected forms, while languages such as Japanese, with rich systems of closed-class forms, tend to have more errors involving closed-class items.	0
10235374	Clear cell variant of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor (CEOT) in the maxilla: report of a case with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigations. A rare case of clear cell variant of calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor is presented with immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigations. A 14-year-old Japanese girl was admitted with a complaint of swelling in the right posterior maxilla. Radiological examination showed a well-circumscribed radiolucent lesion located close to the impacted third molar. After only a partial tumor excision, the tumor recurred 13 years later. It appeared radiologically as an irregular radiodensity, and a subtotal maxillectomy was performed. Histological examination showed sheets and/or strands composed almost entirely of clear vacuolated epithelial cells in a stroma containing intercellular amyloid-like material and calcification. Histochemical and ultrastructural analysis detected cytoplasmic glycogen granules in the clear cells, and positive immunoreactivities for cytokeratins 8, 13 and 19; filaggrin and anti-ameloblastoma antibodies suggested an odontogenic epithelial origin.	0

23106661	Allergic rhinitis is associated with otitis media with effusion: a birth cohort study. BACKGROUND: Childhood otitis media with effusion is a common disease and a link to allergic diseases has been suggested. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between atopic disease and otitis media with effusion diagnosed according to strict objective case definitions by age 6  years. METHODS: We evaluated 291 children in the 6th year of life from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) 2000 birth cohort. Otitis media with effusion was diagnosed based on tympanometric and objective evaluation. Asthma, eczema, allergic- and non-allergic rhinitis was diagnosed prospectively by pre-defined algorithms. Nasal mucosal swelling was assessed using acoustic rhinometry and nasal eosinophilia from scrapings. Analyses were performed using logistic regression and adjusted for dog, cat and smoking exposure, paternal atopy, household income, older siblings, gender and number of acute otitis media episodes. RESULTS: Otitis media with effusion was diagnosed in 39% of the cohort and was associated with allergic rhinitis (aOR  =  3.36, CI  =  1.26-8.96, P  =  0.02), but not with nasal mucosal swelling, nasal oeosinophilia, non-allergic rhinitis, asthma or eczema. CONCLUSION: Otitis media with effusion is closely associated with allergic rhinitis presumably caused by allergic inflammation, but not mechanical nasal mucosal swelling. These findings warrant an increased awareness of otitis media with effusion in children with allergic rhinitis.	0
15930104	The simultaneous loss of Arx and Pax4 genes promotes a somatostatin-producing cell fate specification at the expense of the alpha- and beta-cell lineages in the mouse endocrine pancreas. The specification of the different mouse pancreatic endocrine subtypes is determined by the concerted activities of transcription factors. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating endocrine fate allocation remain unclear. In the present study, we uncover the molecular consequences of the simultaneous depletion of Arx and Pax4 activity during pancreas development. Our findings reveal a so far unrecognized essential role of the paired-box-encoding Pax4 gene. Specifically, in the combined absence of Arx and Pax4, an early-onset loss of mature alpha- and beta-cells occurs in the endocrine pancreas, concomitantly with a virtually exclusive generation of somatostatin-producing cells. Furthermore, despite normal development of the PP-cells in the double-mutant embryos, an atypical expression of the pancreatic polypeptide (PP) hormone was observed in somatostatin-labelled cells after birth. Additional characterizations indicate that such an expression of PP was related to the onset of feeding, thereby unravelling an epigenetic control. Finally, our data provide evidence that both Arx and Pax4 act as transcriptional repressors that control the expression level of one another, thereby mediating proper endocrine fate allocation.	1
23886139	KAI1/CD82 and MRP1/CD9 serve as markers of infiltration, metastasis, and prognosis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas. OBJECTIVE: The current study explored the expression of KAI1/CD82 and MRP1/CD9 and its significance in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). METHODS: The expression levels of KAI1/CD82 and MRP1/CD9 in 100 LSCC tissue specimens, as well as in 30 para-LSCC non-carcinomatous tissue specimens randomly taken from the patients, were assessed using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) and immunohistochemistry and correlations with pathological parameters of LSCC and their influence on survival function were analyzed. RESULTS: KAI1/CD82 and MRP1/CD9 showed basically consistent changes in both mRNA and protein expression. Their expression in the 30 LSCC specimens was significantly lower compared with that in the corresponding non-carcinous tissues (P < 0.01 or 0.05), notably correlating with TNM stage, differentiation degree, clinical stage, and lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.01 or 0.05), but not gender, age, and LSCC growth sites (P > 0.05). The median survival of patients with positive KAI1/CD82 and MRP1/CD9 protein expression was longer than that of patients with negative protein expression (P < 0.01 or 0.05). KAI1/CD82 protein expression negatively correlated with MRP1/CD9 protein expression in LSCC (  (2) = 31.25, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: KAI1/CD82 and MRP1/CD9 may jointly participate in the development of LSCC. They may serve as the markers for judging the infiltration, metastasis, and prognosis of LSCC.	0
19425293	[Cerebrovascular disorders and central hemodynamics of Takayasu disease]. The results of the study of 45 patients with Takayasu arteritis using the complex clinical-neurological and instrumental examination are presented. Cerebrovascular disorders and defects of the white and grey matter were registered in 84.4% patients. The immunological study of CSF was done for 6 patients. All changes revealed that the mechanisms of development of vasculitis in this pathology are related to the humoral and cellular autoimmune reaction to vessel wall antigens in patients with Takayasu disease. The neurological manifestation may be initial, relating to the development of the disease as such, and secondary, i.e., the result of the damage of other organs and systems.	0
10764626	Low-level doxorubicin resistance in benzo[a]pyrene-treated KB-3-1 cells is associated with increased LRP expression and altered subcellular drug distribution. The P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-negative epidermoid pharyngeal carcinoma cells KB-3-1 were grown in 0.25 mM benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) for 3 months and increased resistance to doxorubicin, but not to vinblastine, colchicine, or cisplatin, was found. Doxorubicin resistance was not altered by cyclosporin, the P-gp inhibitor. Intracellular accumulation of BaP or calcein, a substrate for P-gp and multidrug resistance protein (MRP), was not altered by inhibitors of the P-gp and MRP. The expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1, lung-resistance-related protein (LRP), P-gp, and MRP was investigated. Overexpression of CYP1A and LRP, on the mRNA and protein levels, was found. BaP-treated KB-3-1 cells remained P-gp negative while the level of MRP was not altered. Subcellular accumulation of BaP was found to be localized in the cytoplasm and minimal in the nuclei in BaP treated cells. In contrast, even penetration of BaP to the nuclei and cytoplasm was found in untreated cells. Subcellular distribution of doxorubicin was altered following BaP treatment with localized accumulation of the cancer drug in cytoplasmic organelles but not in the nuclei. Our data suggested that LRP might play a protective role against toxic compounds. The correlation of increased expression of LRP, but not P-gp nor MRP, with decreased doxorubicin accumulation in the nuclear target suggests a pivotal role of this perinuclear transporter in the MDR phenotype of P-gp-negative cancer cells. These results also propose an alternative mechanism of cancer drug resistance emergence, namely, induction of LRP activity following treatment with BaP, an environmental toxicant and a carcinogen.	0
19878938	Patients with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum have similar symptoms during egg stimulation and develop ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: case series. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the symptoms and outcomes of ovarian stimulation in patients with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Research laboratory of a university hospital. PATIENT(S): Participants in an ongoing study on hyperemesis gravidarum that reported ovarian stimulation for gestational surrogacy. INTERVENTION(S): Review of medical records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pregnancy history, symptoms, estradiol level and mature oocyte number in cases, and nausea and vomiting level reported in surrogate. RESULT(S): Three cases in their early thirties with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum presented with severe nausea and vomiting during ovarian stimulation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Gestational carriers reported normal nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. CONCLUSION(S): This series provides lessons for in vitro fertilization for cases with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum and their gestational carriers as well as insight into the cause of hyperemesis gravidarum and its potential role in fertility. A link between hyperemesis gravidarum and an evolutionary advantage of increased fertility suggests a novel theory to explain the selection for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.	0
8384306	The murine myeloperoxidase promoter contains several functional elements, one of which binds a cell type-restricted transcription factor, myeloid nuclear factor 1 (MyNF1). The myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene is expressed specifically in myeloid cells. There is significant homology between the murine and human MPO genes in the 1.6-kb region located upstream of the murine MPO transcription initiation sites. 5',3', and internal deletions of this DNA segment localized several cis-acting DNA elements in the murine MPO promoter which are functional in 32D cl3 cells, a murine myeloblast cell line which expresses MPO. These DNA elements did not function well in mouse L-cell fibroblasts. Additional mutagenesis of the most active promoter region allowed the delimitation of a functional 20-bp segment. Mutation of the enhancer core motif within this segment was functionally deleterious, and an oligonucleotide containing these base pairs increased the activity of a minimal promoter. This same oligonucleotide, but not a mutant variant, could bind a set of nuclear proteins, myeloid nuclear factors 1 alpha and 1 beta (MyNF1 alpha and -1 beta), present in 32D cl3 cells but absent from L cells, murine erythroleukemia cells, and SP2 lymphoid cells.	0
8838434	On the cerebro-protective effects of caroverine, a calcium-channel blocker and antiglutamatergic drug: double-blind, placebo-controlled, EEG mapping and psychometric studies under hypoxia. 1. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the acute antihypoxidotic properties of the calcium-channel blocking and antiglutamatergic caroverine were investigated utilizing blood gas analysis, EEG mapping and psychometry under a transient, reversible, hypoxic hypoxidosis. 2. The latter was induced by a fixed gas combination of 9.8% oxygen (O2) and 90.2% nitrogen (N2) (found in 6000 m altitude), which was inhaled for 23 min under normobaric conditions by 16 healthy, young volunteers. They received randomized after an adaptation session, single oral doses of placebo, 40, 80 and 120 mg caroverine. Evaluation of blood gases, EEG mapping and psychometry were carried out 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post-drug, during hypoxia. 3. Blood gas analysis demonstrated a drop in PO2 from 95 to 33 and 30 mmHg, in PCO2 from 38 to 30 and 30 mmHg in the 14th and 23rd minute of inhalation, respectively, while pH increased from 7.41 to 7.50 and 7.51. Base excess and standard bicarbonate remained stable. 4. EEG mapping under hypoxia exhibited a marked increase of delta/theta, decrease of alpha and an increase of superimposed beta activity, which reflects deterioration of vigilance. 5. Caroverine attenuated this hypoxia-induced vigilance decrement in a dose- and time-dependent manner 6-8 h after 80 mg and 2-8 h after 120 mg. 6. Hypoxic hypoxidosis induced a deterioration of memory and attention variability, which was mitigated by 80 and 120 mg caroverine. However, there was an augmentation of the hypoxia-induced decrement in psychomotor performance after 120 mg. 7. The drug was well tolerated, and there were no significant differences compared with placebo with regard to pulse and blood pressure.	0
10775428	Identification and characterization of an animal delta(12) fatty acid desaturase gene by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have cloned a Caenorhabditis elegans cDNA encoding a Delta12 fatty acid desaturase and demonstrated its activity by heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The predicted protein is highly homologous both to the cloned plant genes with similar function and to the published sequence of the C. elegans omega-3 fatty acid desaturase. In addition, it conforms to the structural constraints expected of a membrane-bound fatty acid desaturase including the canonical histidine-rich regions. This is the first report of a cloned animal Delta(12) desaturase gene. Expression of this cDNA in yeast resulted in the accumulation of 16:2 and 18:2 (linoleic) acids. The increase of membrane fluidity brought about by this change in unsaturation was measured. The production of polyunsaturated fatty acids in yeast cells and the concomitant increase in membrane fluidity was correlated with a modest increase in growth rate at low temperature and with increased resistance to ethanol and oxidative stress.	0
8077572	Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectra and changes in body composition during weight loss. OBJECTIVE: The use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to monitor cellular bioenergetics during weight loss may provide novel insights regarding metabolic functioning. METHODS: Changes were noted in 18 sedentary, moderately overweight women following a 7-week program consisting of a low-fat, 422-428 MJ/day (1010-1025 kcal/day) diet, a progressive walking program, a vitamin-mineral-fortified, isolated-protein meal supplement drink and a weekly group meeting. Mitochondrial energy production and utilization were assessed by measuring the concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and phosphocreatine (PCr) through magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Anthropometric changes were also monitored. RESULTS: Dietary analysis of subjects' pre-intervention food records showed intakes of numerous vitamins and minerals below 100% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), most commonly for folic acid, vitamin E, magnesium, iron and zinc. Relative to pre-intervention levels, final measurements showed that all women lost body weight, ranging from 2.6 to 10.0 kg. Body mass index declined in all subjects, from 0.55 to 3.86 kg/m2. All subjects lost fat mass, ranging from 0.9 to 10.4 kg. Seventeen of 18 women showed a decline in their percentage of body fat, ranging from 2.3 to 10.1%. Twelve of 18 subjects showed an increase of 0.1-3.5 kg of fat-free mass, with half of these values increasing by > 1.0 kg. No changes from baseline levels were found in the Pi/PCr ratio over 7 weeks under resting, exercise or recovery conditions, suggesting a preservation in muscle energy function over the course of the study while the subjects were losing fat mass and total body weight. CONCLUSIONS: The possible metabolic advantage associated with a program that employs moderate energy restriction, repletion of vitamin and mineral intakes to RDA levels, and a regular aerobic exercise program is proposed.	0
7205671	Effects of pentagastrin on intestinal absorption and blood flow in the anaesthetized dog. 1. Pentagastrin (1, 10 micrograms/min) was infused I.V. into fed and fasted anaesthetized dogs and the intestinal absorption of NaCl and H2O and blood flow were determined. The influence of pentagastrin-induced cardiovascular changes on absorption was investigated. 2. 22Na and 3H2O were used to determine the unidirectional Na and H2O fluxes from saline perfused through the ileal lumen and the clearances of 3H2O were used to calculate total and absorptive site blood flow. 3. Ileal absorption of Na and H2O was reduced by 10 micrograms/min pentagastrin due primarily to significant increases in the secretory flux of Na and decreases in the absorptive flux of H2O in both fed and fasted animals. 4. Neither total intestinal blood flow, arterial nor mesenteric vein pressure were changed by pentagastrin but absorptive site blood flow was decreased in fasted but not in fed dogs. 5. Pretreatment with atropine reduced the effects of pentagastrin but pretreatment with guanethidine potentiated the effects of pentagastrin. 6. Absorptive site blood flow was positively linearly correlated with the absorptive fluxes of both Na and H2O. The relationships between the secretory fluxes of Na and H2O and estimated capillary pressure were changed from a positive relationship in control periods to a less positive or negative relationship following pentagastrin. 7. It was concluded that pentagastrin reduces intestinal absorption through both a cardiovascular effect and an effect on the intestinal epithelium. Also, there is a strong autonomic component in the effects of pentagastrin on intestinal absorption.	0
17873537	Group C streptococcal endocarditis. Group C streptococcus is found in many domestic animals and rarely causes infection in human beings. Severe infections caused by these bacteria are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We present a case of group C streptococcus endocarditis with sequelae, right-eye endophthalmitis, and multilobar pneumonia caused by septic embolization from the infected mitral valve.	0
15629176	A salvage surgical solution for recurrent lymphangioma of the prepuce. Treatment of lymphangioma circumscriptum of the prepuce is often technically demanding. Many different medical and surgical approaches have been described over the years, none of which has proved completely successful. We describe a case in which skin deficiency was a problem after prior multiple excisions of lymphangiomatous tissue. We decided to bury the degloved shaft in the scrotum. After 6 months the penis was raised and reconstructed using scrotal skin; this achieved satisfactory skin coverage. In such cases piliferous follicles can easily be dealt with at a later stage by cosmetic treatment. We believe this technical approach may be a valid alternative to conventional procedures (i.e. grafts and flaps) especially when extensive resection makes skin coverage particularly difficult.	0
20117111	Prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia 8 years after a large waterborne outbreak of bacterial dysentery: a cohort study. BACKGROUND _ AIMS: Symptoms of dyspepsia may occur following an episode of acute gastroenteritis, but data are conflicting. We assessed prevalence of uninvestigated dyspepsia in a cohort of individuals, some of whom were exposed to bacterial dysentery in May 2000, as well as risk factors for dyspepsia in exposed individuals. METHODS: This was a cohort study conducted in the town of Walkerton, Ontario, Canada. Involved individuals were recruited into the Walkerton Health Study between 2002 and 2003 and were attending for annual assessment in 2008. Exposed individuals were subdivided into those with self-reported gastroenteritis, with acute illness unconfirmed by health records, and those with clinically confirmed gastroenteritis, with substantiation of acute illness by health record review. Presence of dyspepsia at 8 years, according to a broad definition (any symptom referable to the upper gastrointestinal tract), and the Rome II criteria, was compared between exposed and nonexposed individuals. RESULTS: Of 2597 subjects eligible, 1088 (41.9%) provided data for analysis, and 706 (64.9%) had reported acute gastroenteritis. Multivariate odd ratios for dyspepsia at 8 years in exposed individuals using a broad definition and the Rome II definition were 2.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.58-2.78) and 2.30 (95% confidence interval: 1.63-3.26), respectively. Prevalence of dyspepsia was higher in females; smokers; those with premorbid irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, or depression; and those reporting >7 days of diarrhea or abdominal cramps during the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of dyspepsia 8 years after an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis were significantly more prevalent in exposed compared with nonexposed individuals.	0
7617912	[A method of image enhancement in the use of hydrosoluble uro-angiographic contrast media]. The radiographic contrast, when using hydrosoluble uro-angiographic contrast media, depends on several factors. A phantom and a new method are proposed to assess and optimize the contrast. The phantom allows to simulate three pseudovessels with diameter of 2 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm, placed in a water-equivalent layer of 20/cm thickness. The phantom is exposed to a photon beam produced by a conventional X ray tube, and the images are obtained using conventional screen film system. The aim of the study is to assess the radiographic contrast between the vessel and the background when modifying the optical density of the radiograph (by different settings of the mAs switching), the X-ray tube high voltage and the diameter of the vessels; the contrast was studied with four different contrast media (Uromiro 24%, Conray 36%, Iopamiro 300 and Iomeron 400) and three X-ray tube high voltages (60 kV, 80 kV, 100 kV). The curve fitting the contrast as a function of the optical density of the background (in each condition of high voltage, diameter of the vessel and contrast media used) is a parabola. A quite narrow distribution of abscissas of the maxima of the parabolas was found, ranging from the minimum optical density 1.21 in the case of 100 kV high voltage and 2 mm diameter to the maximum optical density 1.58 in the case 60 kV and 10 mm. The mean value (1.40) is proposed as the optical density of the background optimizing the contrast according to the screen-film system used. In conclusion, the authors suggest to optimize the use of contrast media, trying to obtain radiographs with an optical density approaching the optimal value in any clinical situation. Therefore tables of the settings of the X-ray tube and generator are required; the tables must take into account the main parameters influencing the settings, such as the source-film distance, the water-equivalent thickness of the patient and the film-screen system used.	0
18350585	Genetic investigation of the patrilineal kinship structure of early medieval Ireland. A previous study of Irish Y-chromosomes uncovered a likely patrilineal kinship basis to the most prominent early Irish tribal entity/kingdom, the U   N  ill, who dominated the North of the Island during the early medieval period (600-1,000 AD). However, it is unknown to what extent this was a general feature of the multitude of Irish kingdoms that existed over the same period. Irish surnames are patrilineally inherited in a similar manner to the Y-chromosome and their origin can often be traced to pre-existing tribal units. We genotyped 17 microsatellites in 247 Y-chromosomes from men with surnames that are purported to be derived from two different tribes (E  ganacht and D  l Cais) from the Southern province of Munster, as well as a third cohort of random names from the same geographic area. Although there is some sharing of Y-chromosomes between surnames of the same putative origin, there was no clear distinction between either grouping and the control, suggesting that the level of U   N  ill patrilineal kinship was not a universal feature of Irish tribal units. In turn this argues that an extensive extended clan or biological legacy of an eponymous founding ancestor was not necessarily a crucial factor in their establishment.	0
23752925	ROS play a critical role in the differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages and the occurrence of tumor-associated macrophages. Differentiation to different types of macrophages determines their distinct functions. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumorigenesis owing to their proangiogenic and immune-suppressive functions similar to those of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. We report that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is critical for macrophage differentiation and that inhibition of superoxide (O(2-)) production specifically blocks the differentiation of M2 macrophages. We found that when monocytes are triggered to differentiate, O(2-) is generated and is needed for the biphasic ERK activation, which is critical for macrophage differentiation. We demonstrated that ROS elimination by butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and other ROS inhibitors blocks macrophage differentiation. However, the inhibitory effect of ROS elimination on macrophage differentiation is overcome when cells are polarized to classically activated (M1), but not M2, macrophages. More importantly, the continuous administration of the ROS inhibitor BHA efficiently blocked the occurrence of TAMs and markedly suppressed tumorigenesis in mouse cancer models. Targeting TAMs by blocking ROS can be a potentially effective method for cancer treatment.	0
20724433	Increased IL-17 production by peripheral T helper cells after tumour necrosis factor blockade in rheumatoid arthritis is accompanied by inhibition of migration-associated chemokine receptor expression. OBJECTIVES: The contribution of IL-17-producing Th17 cells to the pathogenesis of T-cell-mediated inflammatory disorders such as RA and atopic dermatitis (AD) has to be viewed in relation to the role of Th1/Th2 cells and long-recognized key cytokines like TNF. We aimed to study the frequency and migration-associated phenotype of peripheral Th17, Th1 and Th2 cells in healthy individuals, RA and AD patients, and to study the influence of anti-TNF therapy in RA. METHODS: Intracellular IL-17, IFN-y and IL-4 production and CC-chemokine receptor CCR4 and CCR6 expression were analysed flow cytometrically in peripheral memory Th cells from healthy individuals, AD and RA patients. The latter were grouped by disease activity and presence or absence of adalimumab therapy. In RA patients initiating anti-TNF therapy, cytokine production by in vitro-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells was measured by cytometric bead array. RESULTS: The peripheral Th17 cell frequency is elevated in AD but not in RA. In RA, Th17 cells and IL-17 production increase after anti-TNF therapy, irrespective of disease activity. Th1 cells and IFN-y production are elevated in remission and under anti-TNF therapy. CCR6 expression is up-regulated in Th17 cells, but RA patients in remission under anti-TNF therapy have significantly lower expression than those with active disease. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in peripheral Th17 cells in RA patients after anti-TNF therapy is accompanied by a decrease in Th17-specific CCR6 expression, which might prevent homing of these potentially pro-inflammatory cells to the synovium.	0
22060756	Monitoring nitrite and nitrate residues in frankfurters during processing and storage. Frankfurter-type sausages were prepared in a pilot plant with different concentrations of NaNO(2) (75, 125 or 250 ppm) combined or not with 200 ppm KNO(3). A meat system, free of curing agents, was also used as control. Nitrite and nitrate levels were tested in various processing steps and over 120 days storage at 3   C of the vacuum-packaged frankfurters. Little influence of the originally added nitrite level on the amount of nitrate formed was observed. Important losses of nitrite and nitrate were due to cooking. Thereafter about 50% of the nitrite added initially remained in this form in all samples (39, 59 and 146 ppm, respectively) and between 10 and 15% as nitrate. When only nitrate was initially added, formation of nitrite after cooking was observed (maximum level 43 ppm NaNO(2)). Formulations prepared with both nitrate and nitrite showed no significant differences (p < 0.01) respect to their nitrite or nitrate counterparts. A good correlation among nitrite and nitrate levels and storage time was showed by multiple linear regression analysis. It is concluded that the use of nitrate in combination with nitrite in cooked meat products seems to have little technological significance and adds to the total body burden of nitrite.	0

20202970	Kinship between parents reduces offspring fitness in a natural population of Rhododendron brachycarpum. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A reduction in offspring fitness resulting from mating between neighbours is interpreted as biparental inbreeding depression. However, little is known about the relationship between the parents' genetic relatedness and biparental inbreeding depression in their progeny in natural populations. This study assesses the effect of kinship between parents on the fitness of their progeny and the extent of spatial genetic structure in a natural population of Rhododendron brachycarpum. METHODS: Kinship coefficients between 11,858 pairs of plants among a natural population of 154 R. brachycarpum plants were estimated a priori using six microsatellite markers. Plants were genotyped, and pairs were selected from among 60 plants to vary the kinship from full-sib to unrelated. After a hand-pollination experiment among the 60 plants, offspring fitness was measured at the stages of seed maturation (i.e. ripening) under natural conditions, and seed germination and seedling survival under greenhouse conditions. In addition, spatial autocorrelation was used to assess the population's genetic structure. KEY RESULTS: Offspring fitness decreased significantly with increasing kinship between parents. However, the magnitude and timing of this effect differed among the life-cycle stages. Measures of inbreeding depression were 0.891 at seed maturation, 0.122 (but not significant) at seed germination and 0.506 at seedling survival. The local population spatial structure was significant, and the physical distance between parents mediated the level of inbreeding between them. CONCLUSIONS: The level of inbreeding between individuals determines offspring fitness in R. brachycarpum, especially during seed maturation. Genetic relatedness between parents caused inbreeding depression in their progeny. Therefore, biparental inbreeding contributes little to reproduction and instead acts as a selection force that promotes outcrossing, as offspring of more distant (less related) parents survive better.	0
7229073	Norms for the revised Hebrew version of the Depression Adjective Check List. In order to reduce the readability level of the Hebrew version of the DACL, a new list of words with high frequency of usage in the Hebrew language was created from the translations of E, F, and G. Ninety-four Ss completed the revised form and the translated standard form E in randomized order; the correlation was .90 (p less .001). Split-half reliability for the revised form was .83 (N = 1,230, p less than .001). The revised DACL was included in a national probability sample survey (N = 1253; 699 females and 544 males). T score and percentile norm distributions are skewed toward the left. Raw scores above 20 are rare.	0
8462196	Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) with an 11-year survival. Trisomy 13 is very rare in live-born children. Only a small number of these children survive the first year and very few cases are reported to live longer. Survival time depends partly on the cytogenetic findings--full trisomy 13 or trisomy 13 mosaicism--and partly on the existence of serious somatic malformations. We report on a 11-year-old girl with full trisomy 13. In this case, missing cerebral and cardiovascular malformations probably allowed the long survival.	0
23646715	Regulation of cellular RNA nano-particle assembly by splicing factor SRp20. Cellular RNA nano-particles (RNA granules) such as stress granule (SG) and P-body (PB) are translationally silenced mRNA-protein complexes. Previously, a genome-wide loss-of-function screen using oligomeric siRNAs targeting potential drug target genes was performed to identify genes that are involved in SG and PB assembly. SRp20 (SRSF3), a splicing regulator, was identified as a potential regulator for the RNA granule assembly. Here, we show that SRp20 is a bona-fide RNA granule component using antibody against SRp20 as well as Flag-tagged SRp20 through immunofluorescence microscopy. More importantly, upon knockdown of SRp20 using siRNA, RNA granule formation was potently disrupted indicating that SRp20 is one of the major structural components of SGs and PBs. Interestingly, polysome profiling analyses displayed that SRp20 is distributed in all ribosomal fractions suggesting a potential role of SRp20 as a post-transcriptional mRNA regulator. These results broaden the functional role of SRp20 from the nuclear RNA processing events to the cytoplasmic post-transcriptional mRNA regulatory events through RNA granules that are critical for the regulation of gene expression.	0
8224048	Principal cells of the rat medial nucleus of the trapezoid body: an intracellular in vivo study of their physiology and morphology. The medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) is one of several principal nuclei in the superior olivary complex (SOC) of mammals. It is classically thought to function as a relay station between the contralateral ventral cochlear nucleus and the lateral superior olive (LSO), playing a role among those brainstem nuclei that are involved in binaural hearing. In order to characterise the physiology and morphology at the cellular level of the major neuronal component of the MNTB, the principal cells, we have analysed these neurons in rats in vivo using intracellular recordings and horseradish peroxidase-labelling. Our data demonstrate that MNTB principal cells, when being stimulated acoustically via the contralateral ear, show a phasic-tonic response with an onset latency of 3.5 ms and a suppression of their spontaneous activity following stimulus offset. These neurons have an axonal morphology whose complexity has not yet been described. All cells (n = 10) projected exclusively ipsilaterally and had terminal axonal arbors in a variety of auditory brainstem nuclei. At least two and maximally seven auditory targets were innervated by an individual cell. Each cell projected into the LSO and the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN). Additional projections that were intrinsic to the SOC were often observed in the lateral nucleus of the trapezoid body and in periolivary regions, with only one cell projecting into the medial superior olive. Most, if not all, MNTB principal cells also had projections that were extrinsic to the SOC, as their axons ascended into the lateral lemniscus. In two neurons the ascending axon formed terminal arbors in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, and the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus could be identified as a target of one neuron. The location of the cell bodies of the MNTB principal cells correlated with the neurons' best frequencies, thereby demonstrating a tonotopic organisation of the MNTB, with high frequencies being represented medially and low frequencies laterally. The axonal projections into the LSO and the SPN were also tonotopically organised and the alignment of the tonotopically organised and the alignment of the tonotopic axes was similar to that in the MNTB. Our results confirm previous data from other species and suggest that MNTB principal cells have a great amount of physiological and morphological similarities across mammalian species. Furthermore, the complexity of the axonal projections indicates that these neurons play a role in auditory information processing which goes far beyond their previously described classical role.	0
24375788	In vivo analysis of Arg-Gly-Asp sequence/integrin a5b1-mediated signal involvement in embryonic enchondral ossification by exo utero development system. Enchondral ossification is a fundamental mechanism for longitudinal bone growth during vertebrate development. In vitro studies suggested that functional blockade with RGD peptides or with an antibody that interferes with integrin a5b1-ligand interactions inhibited pre-hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation. The purpose of this study is to elucidate in vivo the roles of the integrin a5b1-mediated signal through the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction in embryonic enchondral ossification by an exo utero development system. We injected Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptides and anti-integrin a5b1 antibody (a5b1 ab) in the upper limbs of mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) 15.5 (RGDS-injected limbs, a5b1 ab-injected limbs), and compared the effects on enchondral ossification with those found in the control limbs (Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser peptide-, mouse IgG-, or vehicle-injected, and no surgery) at E16.5. In the RGDS-injected limbs, the humeri were shorter and there were fewer BrdU-positive cells than in the control limbs. The ratios of cartilage length and area to those of the humerus were higher in the RGDS-injected limbs. The ratios of type X collagen to type 2 collagen mRNA and protein (Coll X/Coll 2) were significantly lower in the RGDS-injected limbs. In those limbs, TUNEL-positive cells were hardly observed, and the ratios of fractin to the Coll X/Coll 2 ratio were lower than in the control limbs. Furthermore, the a5b1 ab-injected limbs showed results similar to those of RGDS-injected limbs. The present in vivo study by exo utero development system showed that RGDS and a5b1 ab injection decreased chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in enchondral ossification, and suggested that the integrin a5b1-mediated ECM signal through the RGD sequence is involved in embryonic enchondral ossification.	0

17556706	Racial differences in skeletal calcium retention in adolescent girls with varied controlled calcium intakes. BACKGROUND: Higher bone mass in blacks than in whites has been related to greater calcium utilization efficiency. Dietary calcium requirements for maximal skeletal calcium accretion during puberty may differ between the races. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the relation between calcium intake and calcium retention in black and white adolescent girls. DESIGN: A range of controlled calcium intakes (760-1981 mg Ca/d) were used in 3-wk controlled balance studies. Some subjects were studied more than once; a total of 182 observations from 55 black girls and 66 white girls were analyzed. RESULTS: Blacks had 185 +/- 32 mg/d greater mean skeletal calcium retention than did whites (P < 0.0001) at all calcium intakes as a result of significantly greater net calcium absorption (P < 0.001) and lower calcium excretion (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary calcium requirements did not differ with race. Higher calcium retention at all calcium intakes during adolescence may underlie the higher bone mineral content of adult blacks than of adult whites.	0

6707021	Partial purification and characterization of microtubular protein from Trypanosoma brucei. The tubulin proteins of the parasitic hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei brucei were purified and characterized. Cytoskeletal microtubules of trypanosomes do not disrupt under conditions used to solubilize brain tubulins. Trypanosomal tubulins, solubilized by extensive sonication, were partially purified from the crude cell extracts by taxol-mediated polymerization. Taxolinduced microtubules were identified by electron microscopy and analyzed biochemically. They consist predominantly of two proteins of about 52,000 and 56,000 Da. Their mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels differ slightly from those of bovine brain tubulins. Immunological cross-reactivity with antibodies raised against bovine brain tubulins confirmed the nature of the trypanosomal proteins. Peptide mapping of bovine and trypanosomal alpha- and beta-tubulins was performed by enzymatic digestion with staphylococcal protease V8 and chemical cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide. In both cases, the peptide patterns generated from the trypanosomal alpha- and beta-tubulins were closely related to each other. This suggests that the trypanosomal alpha- and beta-tubulins may have remained more conserved during evolution than the tubulins from higher eukaryotes. The trypanosomal alpha-tubulin is post-translationally modified in vivo by the reversible addition of a tyrosine residue at its COOH terminus. As in higher eukaryotes, this reaction is completely specific for the alpha-polypeptide chain. Our observation represents the first documentation of the occurrence of COOH-terminal tyrosinolation of alpha-tubulin in an eukaryotic microorganism.	0

12028312	Pattern of soft tissue injuries to the oro-facial region in Nigerian children attending a teaching hospital. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the aetiological factors and pattern of oro-facial soft tissue injuries among children in a suburban Nigerian population. The problems encountered in the management of the patients are also highlighted. SETTING: Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals' Complex, Ile-Ife, Osun State Nigeria. SAMPLE AND METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in children aged < or = 15 years who presented with oro-facial soft tissue injuries between July 1996 and December 1997. Data was collected from a clinical examination of the child and a questionnaire completed by the parent or carer. RESULTS: During the study period, 174 children were managed for oro-facial soft tissue injuries, an incidence of 1.1%, out of a total of 15 582 child admissions. A male preponderance was found (1 : 0.74). The mean age +/- SD was 7.3 +/- 4.2 years and the range was 9 months-15 years. Falls were the most common aetiology followed by road traffic accident. The forehead was the most frequently injured site. A mortality of 3.4% was found. Although animal bites and burns accounted for only 13.8% of all injuries, all the deaths were a result of these aetiologies. Road traffic accidents and burn victims had the longest hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Although falls and road traffic accidents are frequent causes of oro-facial soft tissue injuries, less common causes, like burns and dog bites are more likely to result in death.	0
7085059	A preliminary study of the treatment of trochanteric fractures of the femur with the Kenwright nail. We present a preliminary study of the results of treatment of 106 fractures of the trochanteric region of the femur, using a new expanding compression nail, the Kenwright nail. The device obtains a secure hold in the femoral head and compresses the fracture line, to give very firm fixation, enabling patients to bear weight immediately with much more confidence than with conventional methods of fixation. Earlier discharge from hospital has been possible, with the release of valuable beds. In no case has the nail cut out. A similar study of its use in intracapsular fractures will be reported.	0

6933843	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in idiopathic refractory sideroblastic anemia: evidence for a common lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cell. Acute leukemia of myeloblastic or erythroblastic morphology occasionally occurs as a complication of idiopathic refractory sideroblastic anemia, but the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been previously reported in these cases. A patient with idiopathic refractory sideroblastic anemia is described in whom acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurred. The leukemic cells were characterized by typical lymphoblastic morphology on Wright's stain, periodic acid-Schiff-positive cytoplasmic clumps, elevated levels of deoxynucleotidyl transferase (143 units/10(8) cells), high numbers of specific glucocorticoid binding sites (16,845 sites/cell, Kd = 5.40 x 10(-9) M), non-B, non-T cell immunologic characteristics and clinical responsiveness to therapy with vincristine, prednisone, and methotrexate. Ultrastructural studies of the lymphoblasts identified ferruginous material in lysosomes and occasional mitochondria similar to but less abundant than that seen in abnormal sideroblasts. The concurrence of these two disorders supports the theory that in humans both lymphoid and myeloid cell lines arise from a common pluripotent stem cell.	0
8411791	Differential effects of tight and loose 2-hour restraint stress on extracellular concentrations of dopamine in nucleus accumbens and anteromedial frontal cortex. Changes in the extracellular dopamine (DA) concentrations were examined in the nucleus accumbens (NAS) and anteromedial frontal cortex (AMFCx) during either 2-hr loose or tight restraint stress by means of a microdialysis method. Loose restraint induced significant 100% and 30% increases in DA release in the AMFCx and NAS, respectively, and the increased DA levels returned to the control values despite continued stress. Tight restraint induced an almost constant 100-130% increase during stressing in the AMFCx and a 30% reduction in the NAS. Transient increases in DA release were observed in both regions soon after the cessation of loose, but not tight, restraint.	0
12228536	Partitioning of Electrons between the Cytochrome and Alternative Pathways in Intact Roots. To test the hypothesis that the cytochrome pathway is not invariably saturated when the alternative pathway is engaged, we titrated root respiration of several species with KCN (an inhibitor of the cytochrome pathway), both in the absence and presence of an inhibitor of the alternative pathway (salicylhydroxamic acid, SHAM). The slopes of the resultant KCN [rho] plots ([rho]cyt) were then used to determine whether the cytochrome pathway was saturated in each species. The species used were Festuca ovina ssp. ovina L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., and six Poa species (Poa pratensis L., Poa compressa L., Poa trivialis L., Poa alpina L., Poa costiniana Vick., and Poa fawcettiae Vick.). Although the cytochrome pathway was saturated in a number of species (i.e. [rho]cyt values were 1.0), several others exhibited [rho]cyt values of less than 0.5. Alternative pathway capacity correlated negatively with [rho]cyt, with [rho]cyt values of less than 1.0 occurring in tissues in which the alternative pathway capacity was greater than 25 to 30% of total respiration. The species that did not show full engagement of the cytochrome pathway rarely exhibited SHAM inhibition in the absence of KCN. We conclude that this lack of SHAM inhibition is not due to a lack of alternative pathway engagement but rather to the diversion of electrons from the alternative pathway to the unsaturated cytochrome path following the addition of SHAM.	0
15320882	Induction of systemic tolerance in normal but not in transgenic mice through continuous feeding of ovalbumin. The ingestion of most dietary protein can cause systemic tolerance, and such tolerance is easier to induce in younger than in older mice. In this study, we examined whether oral tolerance to ovalbumin (OVA) could be induced in OVA-T-cell receptor (OVA-TCR)-specific transgenic mice. Continuous feeding or gavage with OVA induced tolerance, measured as reduced antibody production, in young and aged BALB/c mice, in a dose-dependent manner, but this effect was not observed in transgenic mice. Once BALB/c mice became tolerant, this state was maintained for over 44 weeks, although the tolerant state could be reversed by adoptive cell transfer. DO11.10 mice did not become tolerant upon continuous feeding with OVA, and the adoptive transfer of na  ve cells increased the levels of specific antibodies in their sera after antigenic challenge. The immunization schedule used here leads to a Th2-dependent antibody response in normal BALB/c mice. However, the same schedule induced both Th1- and Th2-antibody responses in transgenic mice. Dendritic cells (DC) from tolerant BALB/c mice were less efficient in the induction of the proliferation of cocultured T cells from both BALB/c and DO11.10 mice, as well as Th1 [interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon (IFN)-gamma] and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine production. The DC from DO11.10 transgenic mice were equally efficient in the induction of T-cell proliferation in both normal and transgenic mice, as well as in the induction of Th1 and Th2 cytokines, whether or not the mice consumed OVA. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta secretion was significantly lower in the supernatants of T cells from both normal and transgenic mice cocultured with DC from DO11.10 mice that had consumed OVA, while it was significantly higher in the presence of DC from normal tolerant mice, thus implicating TGF-beta as a regulatory cytokine in oral tolerance in the murine model.	0
17783528	Late triassic naticid drillholes: carnivorous gastropods gain a major adaptation but fail to radiate. Infaunal and reclining bivalves of the Late Triassic Cassian Formation of northern Italy contain drillholes that closely resemble those produced by modern naticid gastropods. The oldest drillholes previously reported are from the late Early Cretaceous; this suggests that the drilling adaptation was lost soon after its appearance in the Late Triassic and originated independently in another naticid clade 120 million years later. The perceived selective value of such an adaptation may thus not always be a good predictor of its long-term survival, which is ultimately governed by factors that affect the speciation and extinction rates of the clade that carries it.	0

11025653	Measurement and validation of benchmark-quality thick-target tungsten X-ray spectra below 150 kVp. Pulse-height distributions of two constant potential X-ray tubes with fixed anode tungsten targets were measured and unfolded. The measurements employed quantitative alignment of the beam, the use of two different semiconductor detectors (high-purity germanium and cadmium-zinc-telluride), two different ion chamber systems with beam-specific calibration factors, and various filter and tube potential combinations. Monte Carlo response matrices were generated for each detector for unfolding the pulse-height distributions into spectra incident on the detectors. These response matrices were validated for the low error bars assigned to the data. A significant aspect of the validation of spectra, and a detailed characterization of the X-ray tubes, involved measuring filtered and unfiltered beams at multiple tube potentials (30-150 kVp). Full corrections to ion chamber readings were employed to convert normalized fluence spectra into absolute fluence spectra. The characterization of fixed anode pitting and its dominance over exit window plating and/or detector dead layer was determined. An Appendix of tabulated benchmark spectra with assigned error ranges was developed for future reference.	0
18949708	A simple and efficient method for predicting protein-protein interaction sites. Computational methods for predicting protein-protein interaction sites based on structural data are characterized by an accuracy between 70 and 80%. Some experimental studies indicate that only a fraction of the residues, forming clusters in the center of the interaction site, are energetically important for binding. In addition, the analysis of amino acid composition has shown that residues located in the center of the interaction site can be better discriminated from the residues in other parts of the protein surface. In the present study, we implement a simple method to predict interaction site residues exploiting this fact and show that it achieves a very competitive performance compared to other methods using the same dataset and criteria for performance evaluation (success rate of 82.1%).	0
12122901	Cutaneous and subcutaneous infections in newborns due to anaerobic bacteria. This review describes the microbiology and management of the major cutaneous and subcutaneous infections in newborns where anaerobic bacteria predominate: omphalitis, necrotizing fasciitis, breast abscess, and scalp infection following intrauterine fetal monitoring. The predominant bacteria known to cause these infections are group B streptococcus, group D enterococcus, group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobic bacteria. All of these agents can colonize or infect the mother and subsequently colonize or infect the fetus or newborn either intrauterinely or during the passage through the birth canal. Infections due to anaerobes are often polymicrobial, and include also aerobic and facultative bacteria. The anaerobes recovered from these infections are Bacteroided fragilis group, Fusobacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Early recognition and effective medical and surgical therapy are essential to recovery. Managements of these infections include surgical debridement and drainage when appropriate as well as topical and systemic use of antimicrobial agents effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.	0
19119262	Association of SLC34A2 variation and sodium-lithium countertransport activity in humans and baboons. BACKGROUND: Sodium-lithium countertransport (SLC) activity, an intermediate phenotype of essential hypertension, has been linked to a region of baboon chromosome 5, homologous to human chromosome 4p. Human SLC34A2, located at chromosome 4p15.1-p15.3, is a positional candidate gene for SLC. The specific aim of this study was to identify genetic variants of the SLC34A2 gene in both baboon and human, and to examine the relationship of these polymorphisms with SLC activity and blood pressure. METHODS: Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified by sequencing the SLC34A2 gene in 24 baboon founders and 94 unrelated individuals. All tag SNPs in SLC34A2 were genotyped in 1,856 individuals from 252 pedigrees of mixed European ancestry. Three SNPs in baboon were genotyped in 634 baboons comprising 11 pedigrees. RESULTS: In human, one SNP (rs12501856) was found to be significantly associated with SLC individually, though it did not pass multiple testing correction; however, haplotype 2 containing allele C of SNP rs12501856 showed strong evidence of association with SLC (P = 0.0037) after multiple comparison adjustment. This haplotype was also marginally associated with diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure. This finding was confirmed in baboons, where a highly significant association was detected between SLC and baboon SNP Asn136Asn (P = 0.0001). However, the associated SNP did not account for the linkage signal on baboon chromosome 5. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent results in two different species imply that SLC34A2 is associated with SLC activity and blood pressure.	0
18274977	Magnesium, the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Magnesium is an essential mineral and has been established as a cofactor for over 300 metabolic reactions in the body. Some research has indicated that lower intakes of magnesium and lower serum magnesium concentrations may lead to and are associated with the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The goal of this review is to examine the research conducted on: 1) magnesium status, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 2) the effects of magnesium intake and/or supplementation on metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. To make this review as current as possible, the majority of research articles reviewed were from 2000 to the present.	0
10633213	[Impact of environmental changes on sand fly ecology in southern Brazil]. Tree felling around a chicken coop and periodic insecticide spraying at the Palmital farm in the county of Terra Boa in southern Brazil impacted the ecology of sand fly species. The most prevalent species (51.6%) before clearing the trees and insecticide spraying was Lutzomyia migonei (Fran  a, 1920), and it is now Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia) whitmani (Antunes _ Coutinho, 1939) (89.8%). There was a highly significant difference between the proportions of L. whitmani reported by this paper (89.8%) and another publication before the tree felling and insecticide spraying (32,6%).	0
21626607	Nationwide register-based surveillance system on drugs and pregnancy in Finland 1996-2006. PURPOSE: The aim of this population-based nationwide drugs and pregnancy surveillance system was to get basic information on the use of prescribed drugs during pregnancy and to achieve more detailed information on drug exposure-outcome associations with data obtained from the Finnish national health registers. METHODS: The data are based on information on all pregnancies ending in births (n   =   632,629) or termination of pregnancy (TOP) (n   =   117,255) in Finland between 1996 and 2006. The data containing information on maternal background factors, chronic diseases and drug purchases during pregnancy, born children, induced abortions, perinatal health and major congenital malformations were obtained from the Finnish national health registers. Information from the different registers was merged through record linkages based on unique personal identification numbers. Statistical analyses were conducted between the exposed and unexposed for individual drugs or Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification drug groups in multivariate logistic regression including potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Nearly half of parturients and almost every third woman with TOP purchased drugs at least once 1   month prior to pregnancy and/or during pregnancy. The most frequent chronic diseases during pregnancy were asthma, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Previously known causal connections between maternal chronic diseases and/or medication and perinatal health risks were already seen in the ATC-group-level analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive and detailed information for pharmacoepidemiological research on the effects of drug use during pregnancy in a cohort setting is possible with long-term and cumulative data collection.	0

12771827	Polyethylene wear particles in synovial fluid after total knee arthroplasty. The aims of the current study were to examine polyethylene particles in synovial fluid at an early stage, and to compare a newly introduced medial pivot total knee prosthesis with an established posterior-stabilized total knee prosthesis. Synovial fluid was obtained 1 year after knee arthroplasty from 17 patients with well-functioning prostheses (22 knees, 11 posterior-stabilized prostheses and 11 medial pivot prostheses) under complete sterile conditions. Polyethylene particles were isolated and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Particle size (equivalent circle diameter) was 0.78 +/- 0.08 microm (mean +/- standard error) in posterior-stabilized prostheses and 0.67 +/- 0.06 microm in medial pivot prostheses. Particle shape (aspect ratio) was 2.30 +/- 0.22 in posterior-stabilized prostheses and 1.90 +/- 0.16 in medial pivot prostheses. The total numbers of particles were 1.16 +/- 0.57 x 10(8) in posterior-stabilized prostheses and 9.01 +/- 2.95 x 10(6) in medial pivot prostheses. Particles were smaller and rounder in medial pivot prostheses than in posterior-stabilized prostheses, but the differences were not significant. The difference in the common logarithm of particle number was significant. The medial pivot prosthesis generated less wear particles than the posteriorstabilized prosthesis, and these findings may have an impact on the incidence of osteolysis and aseptic loosening.	0
23209271	Interactive multicentre teleconferences using open source software in a team of thoracic surgeons. Real-time consultation between a team of thoracic surgeons is important for the management of difficult cases. We established a system for interactive teleconsultation between multiple sites, based on open-source software. The graphical desktop-sharing system VNC (virtual network computing) was used for remotely controlling another computer. An image-processing package (OsiriX) was installed on the server to share the medical images. We set up a voice communication system using Voice Chatter, a free, cross-platform voice communication application. Four hospitals participated in the trials. One was connected by gigabit ethernet, one by WiMAX and one by ADSL. Surgeons at three of the sites found that it was comfortable to view images and consult with each other using the teleconferencing system. However, it was not comfortable using the client that connected via WiMAX, because of dropped frames. Apart from the WiMAX connection, the VNC-based screen-sharing system transferred the clinical images efficiently and in real time. We found the screen-sharing software VNC to be a good application for medical image interpretation, especially for a team of thoracic surgeons using multislice CT scans.	0
12804230	Non-existence of solitary water waves in three dimensions. In the subject of free-surface water waves, solitary waves play an important role in the theory of two-dimensional fluid motions. These are steady solutions to the Euler equations that are localized, positively elevated above the mean fluid level and travelling at velocities with supercritical Froude number. They provide a stable mechanism in bodies of water for transport of mass, momentum and energy over long distances. In this paper, we prove that in the three- (or higher-) dimensional problem of surface water waves, there do not exist any localized steady positive solutions to the Euler equations.	0
20498200	Interleukin 6 is not a crucial regulator in an animal model of tumour necrosis factor-mediated bilateral sacroiliitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the pathogenesis of bilateral erosive sacroiliitis in human tumour necrosis factor transgenic (hTNFtg) mice, an animal model of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: Histological sections of the sacroiliac joints from hTNFtg and IL-6(-/-)hTNFtg mice were evaluated, and wild type and IL-6(-/-)mice served as controls. mRNA levels of inflammation and tissue degradation related genes isolated from sacroiliac joints were also evaluated by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Severe, erosive bilateral sacroiliitis in 14-week-old hTNFtg animals was accompanied by an upregulation of mRNAs related to tissue inflammation such as matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), MMP9 and MMP13 or osteoclast activation such as cathepsin K and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. In addition, IL-6 was increased in the sera and in the sacroiliac joints of hTNFtg animals. However, high expression of these marker genes in sacroiliac joints from IL-6(-/-)hTNFtg mice was also found. Moreover, absence of IL-6 in these animals did not alter bilateral, erosive sacroiliitis when compared to hTNFtg littermates. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 is not a crucial regulator in an animal model of TNF-mediated bilateral, erosive sacroiliitis. This finding questions the potential of IL-6 blockade as a new treatment in patients with AS.	0
9092259	[The staged use of transcranial and transphenoidal surgical approaches in treating hypophyseal adenomas]. The study included 138 patients operated on for endo-extracellular pituitary adenomas which extend both intracranially and into the structures of the base of the skull. Operations via transcranial and transsphenoidal access to various tumor sites were performed in 38 patients (a main group), while 100 patients (a control group) underwent one of these operations. Two-stage operations, followed by removal of the suprasellar and basal regions of a tumor, are expedient for enhancing the efficiency of surgical treatment, reducing the incidence of complications associated with traumatic attempts at removing tumor parts hard-to-reach by transcranial or transsphenoidal approaches, as well as at reducing the number of relapses. At the first stage of surgical treatment it is advisable to make an intervention via transcranial access especially in cases of complex configuration of the suprasellar part of a tumor. The recommended interval between transcranial and transsphenoidal surgeries is 3-5 months. Two-stage surgical treatment does not lead to significant structural changes and to the increased number of complications, and to higher mortality rates as compared to one-stage surgery (transcranial or transsphenoidal surgeries alone).	0

12367533	Oligomeric properties and signal peptide binding by Escherichia coli Tat protein transport complexes. The Escherichia coli Tat apparatus is a protein translocation system that serves to export folded proteins across the inner membrane. The integral membrane proteins TatA, TatB and TatC are essential components of this pathway. Substrate proteins are directed to the Tat apparatus by specialized N-terminal signal peptides bearing a consensus twin-arginine sequence motif. Here we have systematically examined the Tat complexes that can be purified from overproducing strains. Our data suggest that the TatA, TatB and TatC proteins are found in at least two major types of high molecular mass complex in detergent solution, one consisting predominantly of TatA but with a small quantity of TatB, and the other based on a TatBC unit but also containing some TatA protein. The latter complex is shown to be capable of binding a Tat signal peptide. Using an alternative purification strategy we show that it is possible to isolate a TatABC complex containing a high molar excess of the TatA component.	0

21358686	The clinical features and outcome of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in allo-SCT patients: a British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation study. The clinical course of 2009 H1N1 influenza in Allo-SCT patients is unknown. Data were collected in the UK from October 2009 to April 2010 on laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza in Allo-SCT recipients. H1N1 infection was diagnosed in 60 patients, median age 42 years, at a median of 10 months post-SCT. Twenty-one patients (35%) developed pneumonia and nine (15%) required admission to intensive care units. Actuarial mortality was 7% at 28 days and 19% 4 months post-diagnosis of 2009 H1N1 influenza. Increasing age and pre-existing lung disease were risk factors for pneumonia (P=0.006 and 0.037, respectively); older age was a risk factor for death (P=0.012). Morbidity and mortality from 2009 H1N1 influenza in SCT patients exceeds that of immunocompetent patients, but parallels that in other critically ill hospitalised cohorts; the elderly and those with chronic pulmonary disease are at greatest risk.	0
21074478	Dyskinesias do not develop after chronic intermittent levodopa therapy in clinically hemiparkinsonian rhesus monkeys. The stable 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced hemiparkinsonian (HP) rhesus monkey model of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been frequently used to test preclinical experimental therapeutics targeted to treat patients with advanced PD who suffer from motor fluctuations and drug-induced dyskinesias. We retrospectively analyzed data from 17 stable HP rhesus monkeys treated long-term with chronic intermittent dosing of levodopa (LD) in an attempt to induce choreoathetoid and dystonic dyskinesias. Rhesus monkeys in stable HP state for greater than 6 months as confirmed by multiple blinded behavioral ratings and (18)F-dopa Positron Emission Tomography (PET) were treated with optimal doses of LD to provide maximal amelioration of unilateral clinical parkinsonism without any adverse effects. Thereafter, each animal was given chronic intermittent daily challenge with doses of LD up to 700 mg/day orally or with 300 mg/kg/day parenteral injections. LD treatments failed to induce choreoathetoid and dystonic dyskinesias in these animals despite chronic intermittent high dose administration. These results suggest that the stable strictly unilateral HP rhesus monkey model of PD may not be a suitable animal model to test experimental therapeutics targeted against dyskinesias, and that bilateral parkinsonian rhesus models that readily demonstrate drug-induced dyskinesias and clinically relevant motor fluctuations are more appropriate for preclinical experimental testing of therapies designed to treat patients with advanced PD.	0
23117462	[Novel dynamic TOPSIS method in evaluation for quality of medical care]. The quality of medical care shows characteristics of dynamic state with changes in time. However, many of appraisal and evaluation projects usually keep on the status of \"past\" or \"present\". Most of these models are static evaluation approach. In this study, besides the \"past\" and \"present\" status, we took one step further to unveil the future development trends of the medical therapeutical effects. Based on the index value and index increment, a dynamic TOPSIS method is presented. This method pays attention to both transverse and lengthwise information and can not only perform the evaluation on each time section but also can make the final dynamic evaluation. We applied this new method to the evaluation of quality of medical care, which was proved to be effective.	0
18593609	Adipose-derived stem cells: isolation, expansion and differentiation. The emerging field of regenerative medicine will require a reliable source of stem cells in addition to biomaterial scaffolds and cytokine growth factors. Adipose tissue has proven to serve as an abundant, accessible and rich source of adult stem cells with multipotent properties suitable for tissue engineering and regenerative medical applications. There has been increased interest in adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) for tissue engineering applications. Here, methods for the isolation, expansion and differentiation of ASCs are presented and described in detail. While this article has focused on the isolation of ASCs from human adipose tissue, the procedure can be applied to adipose tissues from other species with minimal modifications.	0
15297480	Real-time PCR assay using molecular beacon for quantitation of hepatitis B virus DNA. Levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in the blood serve as an important marker in monitoring the disease progression and treatment efficacy of chronic HBV infection. Several commercial assays are available for accurate measurement of HBV genomic DNA, but many of them are hampered by relatively low sensitivity and limited dynamic range. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive and accurate assay for measuring HBV genomic DNA using real-time PCR with a molecular beacon (HBV beacon assay). The performance of this assay was validated by testing serial dilutions of the two EUROHEP HBV DNA standards (ad and ay subtypes) of known concentrations. The assay showed low intra-assay (<7%) and interassay (<5%) variations for both subtypes. Its dynamic range was found to be 10(1) to 10(7) copies per reaction (1.0 x 10(2) to 1.0 x 10(9) copies ml(-1)). The assay was further evaluated clinically using serum samples from 175 individuals with chronic hepatitis B. The HBV DNA level measured by this assay showed good correlation with that measured by the commercially available COBAS AMPLICOR HBV Monitor test (r = 0.901; P < 0.001). The higher sensitivity and broader dynamic range of this assay compared to the existing commercial assays will provide an ideal tool for monitoring disease progression and treatment efficacy in HBV-infected patients, in particular for those with low levels of HBV viremia.	0

7794236	Biochemical identification of interbreeding between B-type and non B-type strains of the tobacco whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a kinetic microplate assay were used to detect heterozygotes resulting from a cross between B-type and non B-type strains of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. Both strains were homozygous for different esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes, and heterozygotes were produced in one of two crosses between B-type females (diploid) and non B-type males (haploid). In reciprocal crosses, however, no female offspring were produced, indicating that fertilization had not occurred. Despite the identification of individuals heterozygous for the esterase and AChE markers, there was clearly a significant degree of reproductive incompatibility between the two strains. The biochemical assays provided a vital component of this study and the advantages of their use are discussed.	0

19002250	Imitation of body movements facilitated by joint attention through eye contact and pointing in Japanese monkey. Eye contact and pointing are typical gestures in order to direct another individual's attention toward a target. We previously investigated on Japanese monkeys whether joint attention ability encouraged by eye contact and pointing was associated with the imitation of human's actions. The monkeys with the joint attention skills showed the imitation of human's actions. In the current study, we investigated on a monkey whether joint attention ability also facilitated the imitation of human body-movements. Results showed that the monkey being taught eye contact and pointing showed the imitation of human body-movements. These results suggest that the monkeys have basic potential for following another individual's motion, and that what imitation expresses depends on where the monkeys are paying attention. Thus, eye contact and pointing are suitable for directing the monkey's attention toward the human.	0

OBJECTIVE: To determine if patients with incidentally high blood pressure actually have hypertension and if these patients have an increased left ventricular mass. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two family practices with 8 general practitioners in Leiden and Noordwijk, the Netherlands. METHODS: From the Family Practice Network in the Leiden area 133 (67%) out of 200 patients with incidental high blood pressure, who did not receive antihypertensive medication, participated in the study. Their blood pressure was measured 6 times with a mercury manometer, an automatic, non-invasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during 24 hours was performed once and their left ventricular mass was measured by means of echocardiography. RESULTS: Of the 133 selected patients 46% had a mean diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmHg measured with the mercury manometer and 64% had a mean 24-hr diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg measured with the ambulatory blood pressure monitor. The correlation between both blood pressure measurements was moderate (correlation coefficient 0.73). Left ventricular hypertrophy was found in 53% of the patients, irrespective of their blood pressures. CONCLUSION: In this investigation 45-65% of patients with an incidentally high blood pressure had a mean diastolic pressure > 95 mmHg as measured with a mercury manometer and (or) a mean 24-hr diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg as measured with the ambulatory blood pressure monitor; 53% had left ventricular hypertrophy.	0

20582808	Susceptibility of complete bacteria and spheroplasts of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi to rolliniastatin-2. Rolliniastatin-2 is an acetogenin with elevated cytotoxic activity whose effect on bacteria has not yet been analysed and was isolated by CC from the hexanic extract of Annona diversifolia Saff (Annonaceae) seeds. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi as well as spheroplasts of these bacteria to the compound, determining percent inhibition by turbidimetry. The complete bacteria were susceptible to rolliniastatin-2 (28-40% at 2 mg mL(-1)), while spheroplasts showed an increased susceptibility (55-58%, at 1 ng mL(-1)). The most susceptible bacterium was P. aeruginosa, while the spheroplasts of E. coli and S. typhi were most sensitive to the compound's effects.	0
23658820	Density-dependent compensatory growth in brown trout (Salmo trutta) in nature. Density-dependence is a major ecological mechanism that is known to limit individual growth. To examine if compensatory growth (unusually rapid growth following a period of imposed slow growth) in nature is density-dependent, one-year-old brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) were first starved in the laboratory, and then released back into their natural stream, either at natural or at experimentally increased population density. The experimental trout were captured three times over a one-year period. We found no differences in growth, within the first month after release (May-June), between the starved fish and the control group (i.e. no evidence of compensation). During the summer however (July-September), the starved fish grew more than the control group (i.e. compensation), and the starved fish released into the stream at a higher density, grew less than those released at a natural density, both in terms of weight and length (i.e. density-dependent compensation). Over the winter (October-April), there were no effects of either starvation or density on weight and length growth. After the winter, starved fish released at either density had caught up with control fish in body size, but recapture rates (proxy for survival) did not indicate any costs of compensation. Our results suggest that compensatory growth in nature can be density-dependent. Thus, this is the first study to demonstrate the presence of ecological restrictions on the compensatory growth response in free-ranging animals.	0
15124662	Bipolar and monopolar radiofrequency treatment of osteoarthritic knee articular cartilage: acute and temporal effects on cartilage compressive stiffness, permeability, cell synthesis, and extracellular matrix composition. The cellular, biochemical, biomechanical, and histologic effects of radiofrequency-generated heat on osteoarthritic cartilage were assessed. Articular cartilage explants (n=240) from 26 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were divided based on Outerbridge grade (I or II/III) and randomly assigned to receive no treatment (controls) or monopolar or bipolar radiofrequency at 15 or 30 W. Both potentially beneficial and harmful effects of radiofrequency treatment of articular cartilage were noted. It will be vital to correlate data from in vitro and in vivo study of radiofrequency thermal chondroplasty to determine the clinical usefulness of this technique.	0
10352385	Case series of labor induction in twin gestations with an Intrauterine Balloon catheter. The efficacy and safety of labor induction using an intrauterine balloon catheter in twin pregnancies has been evaluated. During the study period (1992-1997), labor was induced at 36-42 weeks in 17 twin gestations. Labor induction was indicated for preeclampsia (n = 10), birth weight discordance (n = 3), suspected fetal distress (n = 2) and postdates (n = 2). Twin A was in vertex presentation in all cases. An intrauterine balloon catheter was inserted transcervically followed by augmentation whenever required. Vaginal delivery was achieved in 15 (88.2%) patients. The mean interval from balloon insertion to delivery was 17.05 h, with 80% deliveries occurring within 24 h of catheter insertion and 80% occurring within 12 h of catheter expulsion. Birth weight was 2,514+/-244 and 2,421+/-367 g for twin A and B, respectively. Oxytocin was required in 4 patients. Postpartum hemorrhage was noted in 1 patient. One patient with no progress of labor and 1 with suspected intrapartum fetal distress required cesarean section. All neonates had a 5-min Apgar score of 10. The data suggest that an intrauterine balloon catheter appears to be safe and effective to induce labor in twin gestations.	0

11151665	Evolution of mycorrhiza systems. Most terrestrial plants live in mutualistic symbiosis with root-infecting mycorrhizal fungi. Fossil records and molecular clock dating suggest that all extant land plants have arisen from an ancestral arbuscular mycorrhizal condition. Arbuscular mycorrhizas evolved concurrently with the first colonisation of land by plants some 450-500 million years ago and persist in most extant plant taxa. Ectomycorrhizas (about 200 million years ago) and ericoid mycorrhizas (about 100 million years ago) evolved subsequently as the organic matter content of some ancient soils increased and sclerophyllous vegetation arose as a response to nutrient-poor soils respectively. Mycorrhizal associations appear to be the result of relatively diffuse coevolutionary processes. While early events in the evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses may have involved reciprocal genetic changes in ancestral plants and free-living fungi, available evidence points largely to ongoing parallel evolution of the partners in response to environmental change.	0

It was found that sclerotization of regional lymph nodes can begin with both cortical and medullary parenchyma. Different stages of this process in lymph nodes were distinguished. These stages depend on the duration of the illness and the zone of organ where the first signs of sclerotization were observed. Small islands of lymphoid parenchyma were found in even well advanced sclerosis lymph nodes, and this allows to assume possibility of full regeneration of all structure of these organs when lymph circulation is normalized.	0

Such a small imbalance in the electrostatic interaction of the shifted anion-cation ions leads to an extraordinary long-range feature potential variation and is now detectable with the extreme sensitivity of the bimodal detection.	0

7711521	WBN/Kob rat: a new model of spontaneous diabetes, osteopenia and systemic hemosiderin deposition. A long-term investigation of bone mineral metabolism in a newly developed strain, the WBN/Kob rat, which spontaneously develops diabetes, possibly due in part to hemosiderin deposition, was conducted. WBN/Kob rats used in this study developed diabetes after 9 months of age. Bone mass peaked at 6 months or 8 months of age, and femoral breaking strength was maximal at 8 months of age, declining rapidly after the development of diabetes. In contrast, both the bone mass and the mechanical strength increased up to 14 months of age in controls. The serum osteocalcin (BGP) levels were lower at 4 months of age and serum 1.25(OH)2D levels were significantly lower throughout the study in WBN/Kob rats than in controls. These results suggest that abnormal bone and mineral metabolism is present in WBN/Kob rats before the onset of diabetes, and that bone strength and BMD decrease simultaneously with the development of diabetes. This strain can serve as a useful model, not only of hemosiderosis and diabetes, but also of osteopenia.	0

19434293	Orbital apex syndrome in a patient with sphenoid fungal balls. Orbital apex syndrome (OAS) is a rare disease that presents with a complex of symptoms, including ophthalmoplegia, ptosis and visual loss. Due to the poor prognosis, making a prompt diagnosis and administering the appropriate treatment must be initiated without delay if OAS is suspected. We report here on a case of a patient with sphenoid fungal balls, and he presented with acute visual loss and ophthalmoplegia.	0
20659428	Microexon-based regulation of ITSN1 and Src SH3 domains specificity relies on introduction of charged amino acids into the interaction interface. SH3 domains function as protein-protein interaction modules in assembly of signalling and endocytic protein complexes. Here we report investigations of the mechanism of regulation of the binding properties of the SH3 domains of intersectin (ITSN1) and Src kinase by alternative splicing. Comparative sequence analysis of ITSN1 and Src genes revealed the conservation of alternatively spliced microexons affecting the structure of the SH3 domains in vertebrates. We show that neuron-specific ITSN1 transcripts containing the microexon 20 that encodes five amino acid residues within the SH3A domain are expressed in zebrafish from the earliest stages of the development of the nervous system. Models of alternative isoforms of the ITSN1 SH3A domain revealed that the insertion encoded by the microexon is located at the beginning of the n-Src loop of this domain causing a shift of negatively charged amino acids towards the interaction interface. Mutational analysis confirmed the importance of translocation of these negatively charged amino acids for interaction with dynamin 1. We also identified a residue within the microexon-encoded insert in the SH3 domain of brain-specific variant of Src that abolishes interaction of the domain with dynamin 1. Thus microexons provide a mechanism for the control of tissue-specific interactions of ITSN1 and Src with their partners.	0
14651215	Phase II study of gemcitabine, UFT and leucovorin in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The combination of gemcitabine with protracted 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer has shown activity with tolerable toxicity. The administration of UFT may simulate the effects of a protracted infusion of 5-FU. Patients with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable measurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma received gemcitabine (800 mg/m2 i.v., administered as an 80-min infusion on days 1, 8 and 15), UFT (200 mg/m2/day, on days 1 to 21), and oral leucovorin (90 mg/day, on days 1 to 21). Thirty patients were enrolled in this study. Five patients had partial responses, with an overall response rate of 17% (5/30), using the intent-to-treat principle (95% confidence interval (CI), 3-30%). Nine out of 25 (36%) patients experienced clinical benefit responses (95% CI; 17-55%). The median time to progression was 3.0 months, and the median overall survival was 7.2 months. The principal adverse event was neutropenia. The combination of gemcitabine, UFT, plus oral leucovorin shows significant antitumor activity and a beneficial clinical effect with an acceptable level of toxicity.	0

12100360	Effect of endurance training on oestrogen receptor alpha expression in different rat skeletal muscle type. It is well known that oestrogens exert muscle anabolic and metabolic effects. Oestrogens act via specific oestrogen receptor (ER) proteins. The mainly represented oestrogen receptor alpha messenger ribonucleic acid subtype (ER(alpha) mRNA) was described in various tissues including the skeletal muscle. Moreover, it has been shown that endurance training significantly increases ER(alpha) mRNA levels in the female rat gastrocnemius muscle. The aim of this study was to determine if this training programme also modifies ER(alpha) mRNA levels in muscles with different typology, the soleus (slow twitch muscle), extensor digitorum longus (fast twitch muscle) and gastrocnemius (intermediate muscle). So far, two groups of Wistar female rats were set up: untrained (u) (n = 7), and trained (e) (n = 7). The endurance training programme was performed for 7 weeks, 5 days per week and consisted of 1 h of continuous running on an adapted motor-driven treadmill involving progressive intensity and gradient of the treadmill. Three different skeletal muscles, extensor digitorum longus (E), gastrocnemius (G) and soleus (S), were isolated and weighed in the untrained (Eu, Gu and Su) and trained group (Ee, Ge and Se). Semi-quantification of ER(alpha) mRNA levels was performed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. In order to attest the efficiency of our endurance training programme, the citrate synthase activity (CS) of each muscle was measured by a fluorimetric method. The CS activity was significantly increased with training in the gastrocnemius [100.00 +/- 4.99% in Gu (n = 6) vs. 138.10 +/- 8.82% in Ge (n = 6), P < 0.01] and in the soleus [100.00 +/- 2.92% in Su (n = 7) vs. 115.90 +/- 3.71% in Se (n = 7), P < 0.01] but not in the extensor digitorum longus [100.00 +/- 1.87% in Eu (n = 7) vs. 96.90 +/- 1.55% in Ee (n = 7)]. Concerning the influence of muscle type on ER(alpha) mRNA level (1) in the untrained group, the ER(alpha) mRNA level was significantly higher in soleus muscle compared with gastrocnemius and extensor digitorum longus muscles [0.43 +/- 0.04 in Su (n = 7) compared with 0.31 +/- 0.03 in Gu (n = 6) and 0.21 +/- 0.03 in Eu (n = 7), P < 0.05; P < 0.05); 2] in the trained group, the ER(alpha) mRNA level was significantly higher insoleus and gastrocnemius muscles compared with extensor digitorum longus muscle [0.43 +/- 0.06 in Se (n = 7) and 0.49 +/- 0.05 in Ge (n = 6) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.01 in Ee (n = 7), P < 0.05; P < 0.05]. Indeed, after training, the ER(alpha) mRNA level significantly increased in gastrocnemius muscle [0.31 +/- 0.03 in Gu(n = 6) vs. 0.49 +/- 0.05 in Ge (n = 6), P < 0.01], significantly decreased in extensor digitorum longus [0.21 +/- 0.03 in Eu (n = 7) vs. 0.12 +/- 0.01 in Ee (n = 7), P < 0.01] and was not significantly modified in soleus [0.43 +/- 0.04 in Su (n = 7) vs. 0.43 +/- 0.06 in Se (n = 7)]. The differences in ER(alpha) mRNA level between trained and untrained animals indicate training-induced effects that are specific to the skeletal muscle type.	0

8894239	Time spent on professional activities and unwaged domestic work. Is it different for male and female primary care physicians who have children at home? OBJECTIVE: To examine how having children affects the hours spent by male and female family physicians on professional activities and on unwaged domestic work. DESIGN: Survey fielded between September 1993 and February 1994. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All Ontario-based physicians certificated by the College of Family Physicians of Canada between 1989 and 1991 after completing a family medicine residency. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported hours spent per week on professional activities and unwaged domestic work. RESULTS: Response rate was 70%; men and women were equally likely to respond. About half (47.7%) had children at home. Women with children at home spent fewer hours on professional activities (P < 0.001) than men with children, whose hours of professional activity were similar to hours of men without children. Both women and men with children reported spending more time on household maintenance than did those without children. Among physicians with children, although men spent time on child care (mean time 11.4 hours; SD 11), women spent much more time on it (mean time 39.7 hours; SD 21; P < 0.001). The women worked an average of 90.5 hours per week in professional and unwaged activities; men averaged 68.6 hours. Childless physicians worked fewer hours: men 54.1, women 52.6. CONCLUSIONS: Female physicians with children at home spend more time on child care and household maintenance than their male partners. These responsibilities reduce professional work time (at least until all children are at school full time) and might deter women from active involvement in professional organizations.	0
11389375	Total spondylectomy for primary malignant, aggressive benign, and solitary metastatic bone tumors of the thoracolumbar spine. The records of 14 patients with malignant or aggressive benign vertebral tumors of the thoracolumbar spine who underwent total spondylectomy (TS) were evaluated retrospectively. Total spondylectomy was performed by bisecting the affected vertebra through the pedicle using fine threadwire saws and removing the vertebra en bloc through the posterior procedure alone or the one-stage anteroposterior combined procedure. Remarkable pain relief and ambulation after surgery were achieved in all 14 patients. No serious complications occurred. Nerve roots were sacrificed in seven cases. A marginal surgical margin was achieved in 10 cases and an intralesional surgical margin was achieved in four. At the site of the osteotomized pedicle, the surgical margin was marginal, with the possibility of tumor-cell contamination in 10 cases. Local recurrence was found in three cases of posterior total spondylectomy at 0.3 to 3.5 years (mean, 3.2 years) follow-up evaluation at the other site of the osteotomized pedicle. These results suggest that this type of total spondylectomy is effective in controlling local recurrence without incurring major complications and is a clinically useful procedure.	0
20723222	Unique health care utilization patterns in a homeless population in Ghent. BACKGROUND: Existing studies concerning the health care use of homeless people describe higher utilisation rates for hospital-based care and emergency care, and lower rates for primary care by homeless people compared to the general population. Homeless people are importantly hindered and/or steered in their health care use by barriers directly related to the organisation of care. Our goal is to describe the accessibility of primary health care services, secondary care and emergency care for homeless people living in an area with a universal primary health care system and active guidance towards this unique system. METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional study design. Data from the Belgian National health survey were merged with comparable data collected by means of a face-to-face interview from homeless people in Ghent. 122 homeless people who made use of homeless centres and shelters in Ghent were interviewed using a reduced version of the Belgian National Health survey over a period of 5 months. 2-dimensional crosstabs were built in order to study the bivariate relationship between health care use (primary health care, secondary and emergency care) and being homeless. To determine the independent association, a logistic model was constructed adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Homeless people have a higher likelihood to consult a GP than the non-homeless people in Ghent, even after adjusting for age and sex. The same trend is demonstrated for secondary and emergency care. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless people in Ghent do find the way to primary health care and make use of it. It seems that the universal primary health care system in Ghent with an active guidance by social workers contributes to easier GP access.	0

10766427	Increased formation of oxidative DNA damage, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, in human breast cancer tissue and its relationship to GSTP1 and COMT genotypes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced damage to DNA plays a major role in carcinogenesis. In order to estimate the level of oxidative damage and its role in breast cancer, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was determined in DNA isolated from human breast tissue. Furthermore, we investigated whether polymorphisms in genes for enzymes involved in generation and elimination of ROS had any association with the level of 8-OHdG in breast tissue. In this study, the level of 8-OHdG in DNA was measured by the high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) method. Genotypes of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A1, glutathione S-transferase (GST)M 1, GSTP1 and catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) were determined by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. A total of 61 Japanese patients were included in the study. The mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues was 2.07 +/- 0.95 per 10(5) dG residues, while the mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of non-cancerous breast tissues was 1.34 +/- 0.46 per 10(5) dG residues. The 8-OHdG levels in DNA of breast cancer tissues were significantly higher than those of their corresponding non-cancerous breast tissues (P < 0.0001). There was negative correlation between the clinical stage and the mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues. Furthermore, patients with genotype of high GSTP1 activity had lower level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues than others. On the contrary, the mean level of 8-OHdG in DNA of breast cancer tissues was higher among patients with genotype of high COMT activity. Our findings support the assumption that cancer cells are more exposed to oxidative stress than adjacent non-cancerous tissue. Genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in ROS metabolism may have a role in individual susceptibility to oxidant-related breast disease. At the same time, reduction of oxidative stress is thought to be a very important measure for primary prevention of breast cancer.	0
19371287	High incidence of meropenem resistance among alpha-hemolytic streptococci in children with cancer. BACKGROUND: Infections caused by antibiotics-resistant Gram-positive bacteria have been reported from many pediatric hematology-oncology centers. METHODS: The susceptibility profiles to meropenem, piperacillin, and vancomycin among oral flora isolates of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (AHS) obtained from six children with cancer who received several empirical therapies (ET) against febrile neutropenia, were investigated. RESULTS: Meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AHS isolated from ET patients was 2.167 +/- 0.258 microg/mL (mean +/- SD), which was significantly higher than the MIC of AHS isolated from control groups. Intriguingly, AHS isolated approximately 6 months after hospital discharge indicated recovery of susceptibility to meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: AHS isolates from neutropenic children with cancer should be checked for antibiotic susceptibility, even against carbapenems.	0
22190369	Rare copy number variants are an important cause of epileptic encephalopathies. OBJECTIVE: Rare copy number variants (CNVs)--deletions and duplications--have recently been established as important risk factors for both generalized and focal epilepsies. A systematic assessment of the role of CNVs in epileptic encephalopathies, the most devastating and often etiologically obscure group of epilepsies, has not been performed. METHODS: We evaluated 315 patients with epileptic encephalopathies characterized by epilepsy and progressive cognitive impairment for rare CNVs using a high-density, exon-focused, whole-genome oligonucleotide array. RESULTS: We found that 25 of 315 (7.9%) of our patients carried rare CNVs that may contribute to their phenotype, with at least one-half being clearly or likely pathogenic. We identified 2 patients with overlapping deletions at 7q21 and 2 patients with identical duplications of 16p11.2. In our cohort, large deletions were enriched in affected individuals compared to controls, and 4 patients harbored 2 rare CNVs. We screened 2 novel candidate genes found within the rare CNVs in our cohort but found no mutations in our patients with epileptic encephalopathies. We highlight several additional novel candidate genes located in CNV regions. INTERPRETATION: Our data highlight the significance of rare CNVs in the epileptic encephalopathies, and we suggest that CNV analysis should be considered in the genetic evaluation of these patients. Our findings also highlight novel candidate genes for further study.	0

16382337	Molecular mechanisms of the alterations in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in hyperammonemia. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission efficacy and is considered the base for some forms of learning and memory. Hyperammonemia impairs LTP in hippocampus. Proper LTP induction in hippocampal slices requires activation of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)-protein kinase G (PKG)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-degrading phosphodiesterase pathway. Hyperammonemia impairs LTP by impairing the tetanus-induced activation of this pathway. The tetanus induces a rapid cGMP rise, reaching a maximum at 10 s, both in the absence or in the presence of ammonia. The increase in cGMP is followed, in control slices, by a sustained decrease in cGMP because of PKG-mediated activation of cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase, which is required for maintenance of LTP. Hyperammonemia prevents completely tetanus-induced decrease in cGMP by impairing PKG-mediated activation of cGMP-degrading phosphodiesterase. Addition of 8 Br-cGMP to slices treated with ammonia restores both phosphodiesterase activation and maintenance of LTP. Impairment of LTP in hyperammonemia may be involved in the impairment of the cognitive function in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.	0

17036042	Use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs: the management of cardiovascular risk in clinical practice. The objective of the study was to analyse the treatment of high blood pressure (BP) and hypercholesterolaemia, as well as the effect of individual or combined antihypertensive-hypocholesterolaemic therapy on BP control and on circulating cholesterol. A retrospective study was performed using clinical data recorded in the general practitioner's database. The sample included all patients, aged > or =18 years, with BP reading or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measurement recorded between January 2003 and December 2004. BP and LDL cholesterol targets were defined using cutoffs based on the guidelines of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP/ATPIII). The study included 4764 patients (mean age 67.6+/-11.8 years, 43.5% males). Target BP was achieved in a higher number of patients under combined antihypertensive-hypocholesterolaemic therapy than in those treated only with antihypertensives: 57.0 vs 50.0% in patients with history of cardio/cerebrovascular (CV) hospitalization, 27.0 vs 16.9% in patients with diabetes or chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and 59.7 vs 49.1% in patients with no CV hospitalization nor diabetes and nor CRI. The LDL cholesterol target was achieved in 61.3% of the subjects: it was independent on the therapy (individual or combined), but related to the degree of cardiovascular risk. Analysing the data contained in the general medicine database made it possible to evaluate the treatment of high BP and hypercholesterolaemia in relation to cardiovascular risk in clinical practice and to establish the need to pay greater attention to achieving the objective set by guidelines.	0
11036454	[Surgical treatment of hypernasality in Denmark]. OBJECTIVE: A palatopharyngoplasty is a widely used operation performed to diminish hypernasality. The purpose of this study was to assess the results of the palatopharyngoplasties and to estimate if the type of cleft or other structural defect influenced these results. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a retrospective study of the patient records from 1/1-1991 to 1/11-1996 comprising 297 operations on which 284 records were available. The results of the operations were evaluated by speech pathologists who have rated the nasality before and after the palatopharyngoplasties. RESULTS: Following operation 90.1% of the patients obtained normal resonance or reduced hypernasality. The type of cleft or other structural defect did not influence the results. DISCUSSION: Palatopharyngoplasty is an effective operative procedure in the treatment of hypernasality, regardless of the type of cleft or structural defect. To further optimize the treatment a higher level of standardization is recommended.	0

15729523	Unilateral pallidotomy versus bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in PD--a comparison of neuropsychological effects. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cognitive and behavioural effects of unilateral pallidotomy and bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. METHODS: After baseline examination 34 patients were randomly assigned to unilateral pallidotomy (4 left-sided, 10 right-sided) or bilateral STN stimulation (n = 20). At baseline and six and twelve months after surgery we administered neuropsychological tests of language, memory, visuospatial function, mental speed and executive functions. Also a depression rating scale, and self and proxy ratings of memory and dysexecutive symptoms were administered. RESULTS: Six months after surgery, the STN group and the pallidotomy group differed significantly in change from baseline in number of errors on two tests of executive functioning. After 12 months the STN group reported less positive affect compared with baseline than the pallidotomy group. One patient in the STN group showed an overall cognitive deterioration due to complications. CONCLUSIONS: Although we need larger groups to draw firm conclusions, our results suggest that bilateral STN stimulation has slightly more negative effects on executive functioning than unilateral pallidotomy.	0

18076958	Serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B) genotype associated with milk production traits in cattle. Serotonin receptor 1B (HTR1B) is one of the 14 different identified serotonin receptors which are involved in the regulation of behaviors such as sleep, fear, aggression, mood, and feeding. The aims of this study were to characterize polymorphisms in the 5' coding and the 3' flanking regions of the bovine HTR1B gene among Chinese Holsteins and to identify the association of HTR1B polymorphisms with milk production performance. SSCP was used to examine the polymorphisms at four loci and the fragments with different SSCP patterns were sequenced. A total of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, among which the 205G>T mutation was found to cause a predicted amino acid change: from Ala to Ser at position 69. The polymorphism of G205T was identified to be associated with milk yield trait. Furthermore, the H1-C genotype was found to be associated with a significant increase in milk yield of 489kg vs. the H1-A genotype (P<0.05).	0

9650315	[Benign paroxysmal vertigo in childhood]. Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is a clinical disorder that usually begins at age 4. The child's otoneurological examination is normal in the intercrisis and the brief episodes of true vertigo are typical. In this paper we describe six new cases that had a follow-up of at least one year after diagnosis. Only a few of the patients had demonstrated vasomotor migraine, but all the children had a family history of migraine, which supports the hypothesis that this disorder is a migraine equivalent. The pathogenesis may be related with a transitory vascular disturbance that produces ischemia of the vestibular nuclei and pathways, as occurs in other vascular territories during typical migraine. One longer-than-usual episode is reported. Otherwise, the evolution of this condition is favorable.	0

17172857	Degradation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha: where does it happen? Adaptive responses to hypoxia are essential for the survival of all organisms. Under hypoxic conditions, transcription of a large group of genes relevant for oxygen homeostasis is induced by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). These genes encode proteins that enable the cells to adapt to limiting oxygen levels by increasing oxygen delivery through induction of angiogenesis or erythropoiesis and producing ATP under anaerobic conditions. The stability of HIF-1alpha protein is also target of O2 regulation. At normoxia HIF-1alpha is hydroxylated at specific proline residues by a recently identified family of prolyl hydroxylases. Hydroxylated HIF-1alpha is recognized by the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product (pVHL) as an ubiquitylation substrate that leads to proteasomal-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha. We have recently demonstrated that the major subcellular compartment where degradation of HIF-1alpha occurs is dependent on the levels of proteasomal activity and on the localization of HIF-1alpha. Furthermore we have shown that the localization of HIF-1alpha degradation is a cell type-characteristic parameter. These observations indicate new levels of complexity in the regulation of HIF-1alpha degradation.	0
15854945	Initial application in the STS congenital database of complexity adjustment to evaluate surgical case mix and results. BACKGROUND: The analysis of the second harvest (1998-2001) of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database included the first attempt by the STS to apply a complexity-adjustment method to evaluate congenital heart surgery results. METHODS: This data harvest represents the first STS multiinstitutional experience with software utilizing the international nomenclature and database specifications adopted by the STS and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (April 2000 Annals of Thoracic Surgery) and the first STS Congenital Database Report incorporating a methodology facilitating complexity adjustment. This methodology, allowing for complexity adjustment, gives each operation a basic complexity score (1.5 to 15) and level (1 to 4) based upon the work of the EACTS-STS Aristotle Committee, a panel of 50 expert surgeons. The complexity scoring, based on the primary procedure (from the EACTS-STS International Nomenclature Procedures Short List), estimates complexity through three factors: mortality potential, morbidity potential, and technical difficulty. RESULTS: This STS harvest includes data from 16 centers reporting 12,787 cases, with discharge mortality known for 10,246 cases. The basic complexity score has been applied to the outcomes analysis of these cases and a new equation has been proposed to evaluate one aspect of performance: Aristotle Performance Index = Outcome x Complexity = (Survival) x (Mean Complexity Score) CONCLUSIONS: The complexity analysis represents a basic complexity-adjustment method to evaluate surgical results. Complexity is a constant precise value for a given patient at a given point in time; performance varies between centers. Future STS congenital data harvests will incorporate a second step, the Comprehensive Aristotle Score, utilizing additional patient specific complexity modifiers to allow a more precise complexity adjustment.	0
15087547	A functional protein chip for pathway optimization and in vitro metabolic engineering. Pathway optimization is difficult to achieve owing to complex, nonlinear, and largely unknown interactions of enzymes, regulators, and metabolites. We report a pathway reconstruction using RNA display-derived messenger RNA-enzyme fusion molecules. These chimeras are immobilized by hybridization of their messenger RNA end with homologous capture DNA spotted on a substrate surface. Enzymes thus immobilized retain activity proportional to the amount of capture DNA, allowing modulation of the relative activity of pathway enzymes. Entire pathways can thus be reconstructed and optimized in vitro from genomic information. We provide concept validation with the sequential reactions catalyzed by luciferase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase and further illustrate this method with the optimization of the five-step pathway for trehalose synthesis.	0
22543204	A novel risk stratification to predict local-regional failures in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder after radical cystectomy. PURPOSE: Local-regional failures (LF) following radical cystectomy (RC) plus pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) with or without chemotherapy for invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma are more common than previously reported. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) could reduce LF but currently has no defined role because of previously reported morbidity. Modern techniques with improved normal tissue sparing have rekindled interest in RT. We assessed the risk of LF and determined those factors that predict recurrence to facilitate patient selection for future adjuvant RT trials. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1990-2008, 442 patients with urothelial bladder carcinoma at the University of Pennsylvania were prospectively followed after RC plus PLND with or without chemotherapy with routine pelvic computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). One hundred thirty (29%) patients received chemotherapy. LF was any pelvic failure detected before or within 3 months of distant failure. Competing risk analyses identified factors predicting increased LF risk. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, pathologic stage>= pT3, <10 nodes removed, positive margins, positive nodes, hydronephrosis, lymphovascular invasion, and mixed histology significantly predicted LF; node density was marginally predictive, but use of chemotherapy, number of positive nodes, type of surgical diversion, age, gender, race, smoking history, and body mass index were not. On multivariate analysis, only stage>= pT3 and <10 nodes removed were significant independent LF predictors with hazard ratios of 3.17 and 2.37, respectively (P<.01). Analysis identified 3 patient subgroups with significantly different LF risks: low-risk ( <=pT2), intermediate-risk (>= pT3 and >= 10 nodes removed), and high-risk (>= pT3 and <10 nodes) with 5-year LF rates of 8%, 23%, and 42%, respectively (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: This series using routine CT and MRI surveillance to detect LF confirms that such failures are relatively common in cases of locally advanced disease and provides a rubric based on pathological stage and number of nodes removed that stratifies patients into 3 groups with significantly different LF risks to simplify patient selection for future adjuvant radiation therapy trials.	0

20617012	Excessive exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke among hospitality workers in Kyrgyzstan. The aim of this study was to assess the levels of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure of men and women in public places in Kyrgyzstan. This cross-sectional study involved 10 bars and restaurants in Bishkek the capital city of Kyrgyzstan. Smoking was allowed in all establishments. Median (interquartile range) air nicotine concentrations were 6.82 (2.89, 8.86) microg/m(3). Employees were asked about their smoking history and exposure to SHS at work. Employees were exposed to SHS for mean (SD) 13.5 (3.6) hours a day and 5.8 (1.4) days a week. Women were exposed to more hours of SHS at work compared to men. Hospitality workers are exposed to excessive amounts of SHS from customers. Legislation to ban smoking in public places including bars and restaurants is urgently needed to protect workers and patrons from the harmful effects of SHS.	0
19886139	Increased use of MRI for breast cancer surveillance and staging is not associated with increased rate of mastectomy. The use of MRI in preoperative staging of breast cancer has escalated recently. Breast MRI has greater sensitivity than mammography, ultrasound, and clinical examination in cancer detection. Because of its variable specificity, however, there has been concern that increased MRI use will result in increased rates of mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer. We postulated that mastectomy rates are not affected by trends in MRI use. We performed a retrospective analysis of imaging tests ordered by surgeons at our breast center from 2003 to 2007. We also reviewed all breast cancer cases reported to the National Cancer Database from our institution during the same time period and categorized them as having been treated with mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. From 2003 to 2007, the number of breast MRIs ordered annually by surgeons increased from 68 to 358. The rate of MRI use increased from 4.1 per every 100 patients seen to 5.7 and from 1.6 per every 100 new patients seen to 2.9. The percentage of women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer remained unchanged during this 5-year interval. Therefore, although MRI use in breast cancer staging and surveillance has increased, mastectomy rates have not.	0
16728402	Glucocorticoid and androgen activation of monoamine oxidase A is regulated differently by R1 and Sp1. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) A is a key enzyme for the degradation of neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. There are three consensus glucocorticoid/androgen response elements and four Sp1-binding sites in the human monoamine oxidase A 2-kb promoter. A novel transcription factor R1 (RAM2/CDCA7L) interacts with Sp1-binding sites and represses MAO A gene expression. Luciferase assays show that glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) and androgen (R1881) increase MAO A promoter and catalytic activities in human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells. Gel-shift analysis demonstrates that glucocorticoid/androgen receptors interact directly with the third glucocorticoid/androgen response element. Glucocorticoid/androgen receptors also interact with Sp1-binding sites indirectly via transcription factor Sp1. In addition, dexamethasone induces R1 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus in a time-dependent manner in both the neuroblastoma and wild-type UW228 cell lines but not in R1 knock-down UW228 cells. In summary, this study shows that glucocorticoid enhances monoamine oxidase A gene expression by 1) regulation of R1 translocation; 2) direct interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor with the third glucocorticoid/androgen response element; and 3) indirect interaction of glucocorticoid receptor with the Sp1 or R1 transcription factor on Sp1-binding sites of the MAO A promoter. Androgen also up-regulates MAO A gene expression by direct interaction of androgen receptor with the third glucocorticoid/androgen response element. Androgen receptor indirectly interacts with the Sp1, but not R1 transcription factor, on Sp1-binding sites. This study provides new insights on the differential regulation of MAO A by glucocorticoid and androgen.	1
16681818	Successful caspofungin treatment of multidrug resistant Candida parapsilosis septicaemia in an extremely low birth weight neonate. Candida septicaemia with multidrug resistance is an uncommon event in preterm neonates. We present an extremely low birth weight infant (gestational age of 27 weeks, birth weight of 980 g) who developed congenital Candida parapsilosis septicaemia. Because the fungus was resistant both to amphotericin B and fluconazole, caspofungin was chosen for therapy. The fungus was successfully eradicated without any clinical or laboratory adverse effects.	0

11482898	Differentiation potential of intestinal mesenchyme and its interaction with epithelial cells: a study using beta-galactosidase-expressing fibroblast lines. Rat intestinal fibroblast lines (F1:G9 and A1:F1) differing in their potential to support intestinal mucosal development were marked with reporter genes to investigate their differentiation potential. The fibroblasts were transfected with plasmids expressing either beta-galactosidase (with or without a nuclear localisation signal) or green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transfection using Tfx50 or Fugene was more efficient than electroporation. The expression of beta-galactosidase was more stable and stronger than GFP. Cells were optimally labelled using the plasmid pL27B-GAL, and sub-clones with a strong and uniform nuclear expression of beta-galactosidase were isolated. These clones expressed beta-galactosidase even after prolonged passage in the absence of selection. The beta-galactosidase tagged lines (F1:G9gal and A1:F1gal) retained the morphological characteristics, viability and differentiation properties of the parental non-transfected lines. In co-culture with a colorectal tumour cell line Caco-2, the F1:G9gal and A1:F1gal cells differed in their morphological organisation but this did not change their expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin.	0
23324482	Motivations for adolescent participation in leisure-time physical activity: international differences. BACKGROUND: Although there are substantial international differences in adolescent physical activity (PA), cross-country motivational differences have received limited attention, perhaps due to the lack of measures applicable internationally. METHODS: Identical self-report measures assessing PA and motivations for PA were used to survey students ages 11, 13, and 15 from 7 countries participating in the 2005-2006 Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study representing 3 regions: Eastern Europe, Western Europe and North America. Multigroup comparisons with Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling examined the stability of factors across regions and regional differences in relations between PA and motives for PA. RESULTS: Three PA motivation factors were identified as suitable for assessing international populations. There were significant regional, gender, and age differences in relations between PA and each of the 3 PA motives. Social and achievement motives were positively related to PA. However, the association of PA with health motivations varied significantly by region and gender. The patterns suggest the importance of social motives for PA and the possibility that health may not be a reliable motivator for adolescent PA. CONCLUSION: Programs to increase PA in adolescence need to determine which motives are effective for the particular population being targeted.	0
18422592	Analgesic efficacy of intravenous paracetamol for outpatient fractional curettage: a randomised, controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) paracetamol for decreasing pain associated with fractional curettage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial included 70 women who underwent fractional curettage. Patients were randomly assigned to receive i.v. infusion of either 1000 mg paracetamol (n = 36) or 0.9% normal saline as placebo (n = 34) prior to the procedure. The main outcome measure was the intensity of pain assessed by a 10-cm visual analogue scale. Pain scoring was performed at t(1) = prior to the procedure, t(2) = during the procedure and t(3) = 30 min after the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t-test, chi-squared and Pearson's correlation analysis. RESULTS: The pain scores at t(2) and t(3) were significantly higher than the score at t(1) in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the pain scores at t(1), t(2) and t(3) among the two groups. Menopausal status had no effect on the pain scores and on the treatment outcome. The pain scores prior to the procedure were significantly higher in women with a history of endometrial curettage when compared with women who have no history. CONCLUSIONS: Fractional curettage is associated with mild pain. We were unable to detect a significant difference in pain scores in patients undergoing fractional curettage when comparing the use of i.v. paracetamol with placebo. History of prior endometrial curettage seems to be a predictor of the basal pain scores at admission although it does not affect the pain intensity related to the procedure.	0
10923042	Molecular analysis in glycogen storage disease 1 non-A: DHPLC detection of the highly prevalent exon 8 mutations of the G6PT1 gene in German patients. We investigated the molecular basis of glycogen storage disease type 1 non-A (GSD1 non-A) in 21patients. In addition to 8 novel mutations within the G6PT1 gene (c.250T>A, c.580G>A, c.627C>T, c.653-4delAG, c. 844C>A, c.1071A>C, c.1268G>A, c.1348G>A), we found a remarkably high prevalence of exon 8 mutations in German patients. The c.1211-2delCT mutation and the c.1184G>T mutation accounted for 32% and 29% of mutant chromosomes, respectively, supporting the hypothesis of a Middle European origin of these two mutations. Together with less common mutations, 79% of German GSD1 non-A patients were either homozygous or heterozygous for an exon 8 mutation. In addition to direct sequencing, these exon8 mutations could be detected by mutation-specific methods such as the detection of heteroduplex formation on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or by the amplification of DNA segments by allele-specific oligonucleotides. Furthermore, the use of denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) allowed a 100% detection and discrimination of all exon 8 mutations. In conclusion from these results, we recommend the use of either conventional or DHPLC screening as the initial non-invasive and efficient diagnostic procedure in patients with GSD1 non-A from populations with a similar distribution of mutations.

18851035	Light scattering in a magnetically polarizable nanoparticle suspension. We investigate magnetic-field-induced changes on transmitted light intensity in a magnetic disordered phase of iron oxide nanoparticle suspension. We observe a dramatic decrease in the transmitted light intensity at a critical magnetic field. The critical magnetic field follows power-law dependence with the volume fraction of the nanoparticles suggesting a disorder-order structural transition. The light intensity recovers fully when the magnetic field is switched off. We discuss the possible reasons for the reduction in the light intensity under the influence of magnetic field. Among the various mechanisms such as Kerker's condition for zero forward scattering, Faraday effect, Christiansen effect, photoinduced refractive index mismatch between the two components of the dispersion, etc., the resonances within the magnetic scatterers appear to be the plausible cause for the extinction of light. The circular pattern observed on a screen placed perpendicular to the incident beam confirms the formation of rodlike structures along the direction of propagation of the light.	0
16645815	Band-selective 13C homonuclear 3D spectroscopy for solid proteins at high field with rotor-synchronized soft pulses. We demonstrate improved 3D 13C-13C-13C chemical shift correlation experiments for solid proteins, utilizing band-selective coherence transfer, scalar decoupling and homonuclear zero-quantum polarization transfer. Judicious use of selective pulses and a z-filter period suppress artifacts with a two-step phase cycle, allowing higher digital resolution in a fixed measurement time. The novel correlation of C(ali)-C(ali)-CX (C(ali) for aliphatic carbons, CX for any carbon) reduces measurement time by an order of magnitude without sacrificing digital resolution. The experiment retains intensity from side-chain carbon resonances whose chemical shift dispersion is critical to minimize spectral degeneracy for large proteins with a predominance of secondary structure, such as beta-sheet rich fibrillar proteins and alpha-helical membrane proteins. We demonstrate the experiment for the beta1 immunoglobulin binding domain of protein G (GB1) and fibrils of the A30P mutant of alpha-synuclein, which is implicated in Parkinson's disease. Selective pulses of duration comparable the rotor period give optimal performance, but must be synchronized with the spinning in non-trivial ways to minimize chemical shift anisotropy recoupling effects. Soft pulses with a small bandwidth-duration product are best for exciting the approximately 70 ppm bandwidth required for aliphatic-only dimensions.	0
16116562	A modified myocardial performance (Tei) index based on the use of valve clicks improves reproducibility of fetal left cardiac function assessment. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a modified myocardial performance index (Mod-MPI) involving assessment of the movements (clicks) of the mitral valve (MV) and aortic valve (AV), improves intra- and interobserver agreement as compared to the previously reported method for MPI estimation. METHODS: The Mod-MPI was recorded by two experienced operators in the left cardiac chambers of 25 normally grown fetuses using pulsed Doppler ultrasonography. The isovolumetric contraction time (ICT) was measured from the closure of the MV to the opening of the AV, the ejection time (ET) from the opening to the closure of the AV, and the isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT) from the closure of the AV to the opening of the MV. The Mod-MPI was calculated as (ICT + IRT)/ET. In addition, the MPI was estimated without using the valve clicks (F-MPI) as previously described. Intra- and interobserver agreement were then analyzed for both modalities. RESULTS: There was a significantly lower intra- and inter-observer variability in the estimation of all time periods with the Mod-MPI than with the F-MPI (ICT: intra-observer, 9.9% vs. 13.9%; interobserver 9.9% vs. 15.6%; IRT: intraobserver, 9.9% vs. 14.8%; interobserver 10.4% vs. 18.3%; and ET: intraobserver, 4.5% vs. 6.1%; interobserver 2.8% vs. 5.2%, respectively). Intraclass correlation coefficient (IntraCC) for the Mod-MPI was 0.8 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.56-0.9) and for the F-MPI, the IntraCC was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.26-0.84); P = 0.01. Agreement between observers using the Mod-MPI showed a mean difference of 0.0 with 95% limits of agreement (LA) -0.09 (95% CI, -0.1 to -0.075) to 0.09 (95% CI, 0.075-0.1) and for the F-MPI the mean difference was -0.01 with 95% LA -0.26 (95% CI, -0.3 to -0.22) to 0.25 (95% CI, 0.21-0.29). CONCLUSION: Calculation of the Mod-MPI based on Doppler echoes of the MV and AV clicks is associated with a lower variation and better inter- and intraobserver agreement than the previously used method for fetal cardiac evaluation.	0
22836634	Non-invasive assessment of exhaled breath pattern in patients with multiple chemical sensibility disorder. Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a complex disorder initiated by chemical exposure, particularly through the airways. MCS patients report sensitivity or intolerance to low levels of a wide spectrum of chemicals. Symptoms could include asthma-like signs, rhinitis, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, psycho-physiological alteration, and other specific tissue reactions resembling hypoxic and oxidative stress effects. To recognize physiological signs that would allow the diagnosis of MCS in a non-invasive way we investigated the potential application of a new sensor system. In healthy volunteers, we measured exhaled breath content in the control condition and under exposure to olfactory stressors that mimic hypoxic or pollutant stressors playing a potential role in the generation of the MCS disorder. The recording system used is based on metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensor having a sensing range of 450-2,000 ppm CO(2) equivalents, which is able to detect a broad range of compounds playing a potential role in the generation of the MCS disorder, while correlating directly with the CO(2) levels. The results indicate that the recording system employed was suitable for the analysis of exhaled breath content in humans. Interestingly, the system was able to detect and discriminate between the exhaled breath content taken from the control condition and those from conditions under stress that mimicked exposures to pollutant or hypoxia. The results suggest that chronic hypoxia could be involved in the MCS disorder.	0
17213921	Randomized dose-ranging controlled trial of AQ-13, a candidate antimalarial, and chloroquine in healthy volunteers. OBJECTIVES: To determine: (1) the pharmacokinetics and safety of an investigational aminoquinoline active against multidrug-resistant malaria parasites (AQ-13), including its effects on the QT interval, and (2) whether it has pharmacokinetic and safety profiles similar to chloroquine (CQ) in humans. DESIGN: Phase I double-blind, randomized controlled trials to compare AQ-13 and CQ in healthy volunteers. Randomizations were performed at each step after completion of the previous dose. SETTING: Tulane-Louisiana State University-Charity Hospital General Clinical Research Center in New Orleans. PARTICIPANTS: 126 healthy adults 21-45 years of age. INTERVENTIONS: 10, 100, 300, 600, and 1,500 mg oral doses of CQ base in comparison with equivalent doses of AQ-13. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs), pharmacokinetic parameters, and QT prolongation. RESULTS: No hematologic, hepatic, renal, or other organ toxicity was observed with AQ-13 or CQ at any dose tested. Headache, lightheadedness/dizziness, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract-related symptoms were the most common AEs. Although symptoms were more frequent with AQ-13, the numbers of volunteers who experienced symptoms with AQ-13 and CQ were similar (for AQ-13 and CQ, respectively: headache, 17/63 and 10/63, p = 0.2; lightheadedness/dizziness, 11/63 and 8/63, p = 0.6; GI symptoms, 14/63 and 13/63; p = 0.9). Both AQ-13 and CQ exhibited linear pharmacokinetics. However, AQ-13 was cleared more rapidly than CQ (respectively, median oral clearance 14.0-14.7 l/h versus 9.5-11.3 l/h; p < or = 0.03). QTc prolongation was greater with CQ than AQ-13 (CQ: mean increase of 28 ms; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18 to 38 ms, versus AQ-13: mean increase of 10 ms; 95% CI, 2 to 17 ms; p = 0.01). There were no arrhythmias or other cardiac AEs with either AQ-13 or CQ. CONCLUSIONS: These studies revealed minimal differences in toxicity between AQ-13 and CQ, and similar linear pharmacokinetics.	0
20712421	The role of the occupational therapist in Jordan: a survey of the members of the healthcare team exploring their knowledge about occupational therapy in rehabilitation hospitals. PURPOSE: Occupational therapy (OT) is a developing profession that has only been introduced to Jordanian hospitals 18 years ago. The main objective of this study was to explore the level of knowledge the healthcare team members in Jordanian rehabilitation hospitals have about OT. METHOD: Two hundred and fifty questionnaires were distributed to different members in the healthcare team in three major hospitals in Jordan. One hundred fifty-three questionnaires were returned and used for analysis. RESULTS: Collectively, the results revealed a fair knowledge level about OT among the healthcare team members in rehabilitation, who stated that the main responsibilities of this profession were rehabilitation for activities of daily living, hand therapy and increasing the quality of life for disabled people. Furthermore, the majority of the respondents agreed that OT is a vital profession that plays an important role in rehabilitation teams, and expressed their expectations of developing standards and regulations for this profession. CONCLUSION: Actions should be channelled towards educating members of the team about OT through university curriculum. It is critical that the Jordanian Ministry of Health establishes specific statements and regulations which clarify the role of the OT within different settings of the healthcare system.	0

17296585	MUM1 expression dichotomises follicular lymphoma into predominantly, MUM1-negative low-grade and MUM1-positive high-grade subtypes. We investigated the expression of MUM1 (multiple myeloma oncogene 1)/IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) in 46 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL) and correlated this with grade and expression of CD10, Bcl-6 and Ki-67. The analysis suggests that MUM1 expression dichotomises FL into low-grade FL of CD10+/Bcl-6+/MUM1-/Ki-67low phenotype, and high-grade FL of CD10+/- /Bcl-6+/weak/MUM1+/ Ki-67high phenotype.	0
15274077	Synovial sarcoma: a retrospective analysis of 271 patients of all ages treated at a single institution. BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for synovial sarcoma (SS) is subject to debate, and different strategies have been used for pediatric and adult patients. The current retrospective analysis examined a large group of patients of all ages who were treated at a single institution over a 30-year period. METHODS: The study included 271 patients who ranged in age from 5 years to 87 years; 255 had localized disease, which was macroscopically resected in 215 cases and deemed unresectable at diagnosis in 40 cases. Chemotherapy was administered to 41% of patients, corresponding to 76% of patients age or 16 years and < 20% of older patients; 28% of patients with macroscopically resected disease received chemotherapy on an adjuvant basis. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival rate for the study cohort as a whole was 37%, although this rate varied with age (66%, 40%, and 31% for patients age < or = 16 years, 17-30 years, and > 30 years, respectively). Chemotherapy was used more commonly for children than for adults. Among patients with surgically resected disease, the 5-year metastasis-free survival (MFS) rate was 60% for those who were treated with chemotherapy and 48% for those who were not; the benefit associated with chemotherapy use appeared to be greatest for patients age > or = 17 years who had tumors measuring > 5 cm (MFS, 47% [chemotherapy] vs. 27% [no chemotherapy]). In the subgroup of patients with measurable disease, the rate of tumor response to chemotherapy was approximately 48%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the authors await more convincing proof of the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of adult soft tissue sarcoma, they recommend that patients with high-risk SS (tumor size > 5 cm) be the first to be considered for this type of treatment.	0
7967147	[Clinical significance of microalbuminuria in elderly diabetic patients]. To clarify the clinical significance of microalbuminuria in elderly diabetic patients, 167 diabetic patients were divided into two groups, 81 elderly patients aged 65 or more (mean age +/- SD: 72 +/- 9, 31 men and 50 women) and 86 middle-aged patients less than 65 years (mean age +/- SD: 56 +/- 8, 49 men and 37 women). We then examined the prevalence of microalbuminuria and other clinical parameters in both groups. The duration of diabetes (10 +/- 7 vs 9 +/- 7 years), body mass index (24.3 +/- 4.1 vs 23.9 +/- 3.5) and the levels of fasting plasma glucose (142 +/- 38 vs 144 +/- 40 mg/dl), HbA1c (7.4 +/- 1.6 vs 7.8 +/- 1.6%), plasma cholesterol (203 +/- 34 vs 212 +/- 46 mg/dl) and triglyceride (117 +/- 57 vs 121 +/- 67 mg/dl) showed no significant difference between elderly and middle-aged patients. However, the prevalence of microalbuminuria (30 < or = urinary albumin level < 300 mg/g.Cr), macroangiopathies involving cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease and atherosclerosis obliterans, and hypertension were higher in elderly patients than those in the middle-aged patients (43.2 vs 20.0%, chi 2 = 10.39, p < 0.01, 29.6 vs 10.5%, chi 2 = 9.66, p < 0.01, 42.0 vs 24.4, chi 2 = 5.82, p < 0.05, respectively). Microalbuminuria in elderly patients may be caused not only by diabetic glomerular changes but also by glomerular changes due to aging and hypertension. Microalbuminuria, macroangiopathies and hypertension in elderly diabetic patients may develop interrelatedly depending on common vascular damages due to diabetes and aging.	0
12199370	Sheep as a new experimental host for Babesia divergens. Babesia divergens was cultivated in sheep erythrocytes in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) or sheep serum. In vitro cultures in sheep red blood cells were initiated with human erythrocytes infected in vitro with B. divergens Rouen 1987 or with gerbil blood infected with several isolates from bovine origin. After the first subcultures on sheep erythrocytes, a ten-fold multiplication of the parasites was obtained within 48 h. Erythrocytes from three splenectomized sheep were infected in vitro with B. divergens; when parasitaemia reached 10%, the animals were inoculated with homologous parasitized erythrocytes. All sheep expressed hyperthermia with a peak between the 6th and the 9th day post-infection (p-i) and a transitory parasitaemia 10 days p-i. In vitro primary cultures were performed on two of these sheep, demonstrating the parasite persistence at very low parasitaemia in the infected animals. Splenectomized sheep can be used as a new model for B. divergens chronic infection.	0
8595410	Novel mutations in keratin 16 gene underly focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (NEPPK) in two families. Keratins K6 and K16 are expressed in suprabasal interfollicular epidermis in wound healing and other pathological conditions associated with hyperproliferation, such as psoriasis and are induced when keratinocytes are cultured in vitro. However, these keratins are also constitutively expressed in normal suprabasal mucosal and palmoplantar keratinocytes. Mutations in keratins have been reported in the basal keratin pair K5 and K14 in epidermolysis bullosa simplex and in suprabasal epidermal keratins K1, K2 and K10 in epidermolytic ichthyoses. Two families with autosomal dominant disorder of focal non epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma, have oral mucosal and follicular lesions in addition to the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Previous studies have shown linkage in these families to the type I keratin gene cluster at 17q12-q21 and this report shows that the cDNA of affected members of both families have novel heterozygous mutations in the expressed keratin 16 gene. These mutations (R10C and N8S) lie in the helix initiation motif of the 1A domain. These mutations do not appear to cause epidermolysis on light or electron microscopy, which may reflect differences in function, assembly or interaction of the 'hyperproliferative' or 'mucoregenerative' keratins from other major types of keratins. The mutations reported here are the first to describe the molecular pathology of focal non epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma.	0

16633213	Electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of refractory depression in a patient with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that is usually first diagnosed in early childhood. It is a chronic and progressive disease in which mucus builds up and clogs passages in many body organs, but primarily the lungs and pancreas. We present a case report of a 42-year-old man with CF who was treated with electroconvulsive therapy for treatment-refractory major depressive disorder. For patients with CF, the primary issue is anesthetic management in a patient with impaired pulmonary function. Our patient received prednisone and intravenous antibiotics to optimize pulmonary status. He responded positively to the electroconvulsive therapy and was able to tolerate it without significant problems.	0
10415392	Response of amygdalar norepinephrine to footshock and GABAergic drugs using in vivo microdialysis and HPLC. These studies used in vivo microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to examine levels of norepinephrine (NE) within the amygdala in response to both footshock and GABAergic compounds. In Experiment 1, microdialysis probes were inserted into a previously implanted guide cannula aimed at the amygdala and the level of NE was examined in response to footshock. A 0.55 mA (2 s) footshock induced a significant increase in NE levels when the microdialysis probe was located within the amygdala; levels of NE did not differ from baseline in rats with microdialysis probes located outside the amygdala. Experiment 2 examined the effects of the GABAergic antagonist, picrotoxin, the GABAergic agonist, muscimol, and saline on NE levels in the amygdala. Rats treated systemically with picrotoxin showed a dramatic increase in levels of NE within the amygdala. In contrast, systemic injection of muscimol resulted in decreased levels of NE. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that drugs that are capable of modulating memory do so by altering levels of NE within the amygdala.	0

11387489	Power transcranial Doppler ultrasound in the detection of intracranial aneurysms. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to perform a large, prospective, multicenter, blinded study comparing power transcranial color duplex sonography (power TCDS) with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) in the detection of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: Contemporaneous TCDS and IADSA examinations were performed in 171 subjects with suspected intracranial aneurysm. Via the temporal bone window, a 2-dimensional hand-held noncontrast transcranial duplex ultrasound imaging system was used operating in power and spectral modes. Sonographers were blinded to clinical history and results of brain CT and IADSA. RESULTS: We found that 157 subjects (92%) had an adequate bone window. Sensitivity per patient was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.87) and 0.46 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.56) for any anterior circulation aneurysms. Sensitivity was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.46) for aneurysms </=5 mm and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.94) for aneurysms >5 mm. Accuracy was lower for aneurysms on the cavernous and terminal internal carotid arteries, including posterior communicating artery origin (0.71; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.79), than for those on the anterior (0.82; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.89) or the middle cerebral arteries (0.79; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: Power TCDS is a promising, inexpensive, noninvasive test for anterior circulation intracranial aneurysms but is less sensitive per aneurysm than alternatives such as CT angiography or MR angiography. Sensitivity is poor for aneurysms </=5 mm in diameter. The internal carotid artery is the most difficult segment to interpret.	0
20831484	Adaptive radiotherapy based on contrast enhanced cone beam CT imaging. Cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging has become an integral part of radiation therapy, with images typically used for offline or online patient setup corrections based on bony anatomy co-registration. Ideally, the co-registration should be based on tumor localization. However, soft tissue contrast in CBCT images may be limited. In the present work, contrast enhanced CBCT (CECBCT) images were used for tumor visualization and treatment adaptation. Material and methods. A spontaneous canine maxillary tumor was subjected to repeated cone beam CT imaging during fractionated radiotherapy (10 fractions in total). At five of the treatment fractions, CECBCT images, employing an iodinated contrast agent, were acquired, as well as pre-contrast CBCT images. The tumor was clearly visible in post-contrast minus pre-contrast subtraction images, and these contrast images were used to delineate gross tumor volumes. IMRT dose plans were subsequently generated. Four different strategies were explored: 1) fully adapted planning based on each CECBCT image series, 2) planning based on images acquired at the first treatment fraction and patient repositioning following bony anatomy co-registration, 3) as for 2), but with patient repositioning based on co-registering contrast images, and 4) a strategy with no patient repositioning or treatment adaptation. The equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and tumor control probability (TCP) calculations to estimate treatment outcome for each strategy. Results. Similar translation vectors were found when bony anatomy and contrast enhancement co-registration were compared. Strategy 1 gave EUDs closest to the prescription dose and the highest TCP. Strategies 2 and 3 gave EUDs and TCPs close to that of strategy 1, with strategy 3 being slightly better than strategy 2. Even greater benefits from strategies 1 and 3 are expected with increasing tumor movement or deformation during treatment. The non-adaptive strategy 4 was clearly inferior to all three adaptive strategies. Conclusion. CECBCT may prove useful for adaptive radiotherapy.	0
16274977	[Modifier genes and cystic fibrosis]. Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease among the Caucasian population. It is caused by defects in the CFTR gene (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator). Although over 1600 disease-causing mutations in the CFTR gene have been described, the highly variable disease phenotype in cystic fibrosis cannot be explained on the basis of this gene alone. Both the environment and other non-CFTR genes are likely to be important. The increased understanding of pathophysiological processes in the cystic fibrosis lung has led to several studies on genes in these pathways. One of the major aims of such studies is to produce targets for novel drug developments.	0

10570207	Dynamin-dependent endocytosis of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the number of ionotropic glutamate receptors present at excitatory synapses. Herein, we show that GluR1-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) are removed from the postsynaptic plasma membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons by rapid, ligand-induced endocytosis. Although endocytosis of AMPARs can be induced by high concentrations of AMPA without concomitant activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs), NMDAR activation is required for detectable endocytosis induced by synaptically released glutamate. Activated AMPARs colocalize with AP2, a marker of endocytic coated pits, and endocytosis of AMPARs is blocked by biochemical inhibition of clathrin-coated pit function or overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of dynamin. These results establish that ionotropic receptors are regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis and suggest an important role of endocytic membrane trafficking in the postsynaptic modulation of neurotransmission.	0

9128263	The clinical application of a new specific functional assay to detect the factor V(Leiden) mutation associated with activated protein C resistance. Resistance to activated protein C (APC) is the most common defect found in patients who have venous thromboembolism. The molecular basis of APC resistance is a single-point mutation (arginine506-glutamine) in the gene that encodes for coagulation factor V. This mutation results in a factor V molecule (factor V(Leiden)) that is less effectively downregulated by APC than is normal factor V. The gold standard for the detection of this defect is DNA analysis. Several functional tests, which are based on activated partial thromboplastin time clotting assays, are also commercially available for the detection of APC resistance. These tests, however, have not been satisfactory. Compared with the results of DNA analysis, the results of these tests are frequently discordant. Further, in some patients (eg, those who have lupus anticoagulant or have been receiving heparin), these tests cannot be performed at all. DNA analysis is therefore required in most patients to distinguish congenital APC resistance (factor V(Leiden)) from other causes of abnormal response in functional APC-resistance tests. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical use of a new chromogenic APC-resistance assay that is based on direct measurement of the effect of APC on factor Va cofactor activity in highly diluted, thrombin-activated plasma specimens. All individuals who provided plasma samples for the study underwent DNA analysis to detect the presence of the factor V mutation. In all patient subgroups, including patients who had lupus anticoagulant and those who were receiving unfractionated heparin or coumarin derivatives, the chromogenic test showed excellent discrimination between normal individuals and those who were heterozygous or homozygous for the factor V(Leiden) mutation. No discordant results with DNA analysis were found in 150 cases. The new test easily can be incorporated in any laboratory that has an automated coagulation apparatus with an option for chromogenic measurements. All reagents are commercially available at low cost, and the test is easy to perform and is not time-consuming. This new, sensitive, and specific test allows large-scale screening for the factor V(Leiden) mutation without the need for DNA analysis.	0
14608011	Localised calcium release events in cells from the muscle of guinea-pig gastric fundus. After enzymatic dispersion of the muscle of the guinea-pig gastric fundus, single elongated cells were observed which differed from archetypal smooth muscle cells due to their knurled, tuberose or otherwise irregular surface morphology. These, but not archetypal smooth muscle cells, consistently displayed spontaneous localized (i.e. non-propagating) intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) release events. Such calcium events were novel in their magnitude and kinetic profiles. They included short transient events, plateau events and events which coalesced spatially or temporally (compound events). Quantitative analysis of the events with an automatic detection programme showed that their spatio-temporal characteristics (full width and full duration at half-maximum amplitude) were approximately exponentially distributed. Their amplitude distribution suggested the presence of two release modes. Carbachol application caused an initial cell-wide calcium transient followed by an increase in localized calcium release events. Pharmacological analysis suggested that localized calcium release was largely dependent on external calcium entry acting on both inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to release stored calcium. Nominally calcium-free external solution immediately and reversibly abolished all localized calcium release without blocking the initial transient calcium release response to carbachol. This was inhibited by 2-APB (100 microm), ryanodine (10 or 50 microm) or U-73122 (1 microm). 2-APB (100 microm), xestospongin C (XeC, 10 microm) or U-73122 (1 microm) blocked both spontaneous localized calcium release and localized release stimulated by 10 microm carbachol. Ryanodine (50 microm) also inhibited spontaneous release, but enhanced localized release in response to carbachol. This study represents the first characterization of localized calcium release events in cells from the gastric fundus.	0

10676418	Statistical methods for developmental toxicity. Analysis of clustered multivariate binary data. This paper discusses some of the statistical issues that arise from developmental toxicity studies, wherein pregnant mice are exposed to chemicals in order to assess possible adverse effects on developing fetuses. We begin with a review of some current approaches to risk assessment, based on NOAELs, and provide justification for the use of methods based on dose-response models. Due to the hierarchical nature of the data, such models are more complicated in the present context than, say, in cancer studies. For example, multivariate binary outcomes arise when each fetus in a litter is assessed for the presence of malformations and/or low birth weight. We describe a multivariate exponential family model that works well for these data and that is flexible in terms of allowing response rates to depend on cluster side. Maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and the construction of score tests for dose effect are briefly discussed. Results are illustrated with data from several NTP studies.	0
24001350	Default network connectivity as a vulnerability marker for obsessive compulsive disorder. BACKGROUND: Aberrant functional connectivity within the default network is generally assumed to be involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD); however, the genetic risk of default network connectivity in OCD remains largely unknown. METHOD: Here, we systematically investigated default network connectivity in 15 OCD patients, 15 paired unaffected siblings and 28 healthy controls. We sought to examine the profiles of default network connectivity in OCD patients and their siblings, exploring the correlation between abnormal default network connectivity and genetic risk for this population. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, OCD patients exhibited reduced strength of default network functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and increased functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal lobe, insula, superior parietal cortex and superior temporal cortex, while their unaffected first-degree siblings only showed reduced local connectivity in the PCC. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the disruptions of default network functional connectivity might be associated with family history of OCD. The decreased default network connectivity in both OCD patients and their unaffected siblings may serve as a potential marker of OCD.	0
9459496	Choline deficiency causes increased localization of transforming growth factor-beta1 signaling proteins and apoptosis in the rat liver. Dietary restriction is known to decrease cell proliferation and increase apoptosis in the liver; however, the role of withdrawal of single dietary factors on cells of the liver is less well understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of short-term choline deficiency (CD; also for choline deficient) on cell survival, proliferation and the expression of proteins related to the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) growth-inhibitory signaling pathway in the liver. In animals fed a CD diet for 6 weeks, classical apoptotic bodies were detected in 0.28 +/- 0.04% of hepatocytes in CD livers compared to 0.096 +/- 0.006% of hepatocytes in control rats fed a choline-sufficient (CS) diet. These classical apoptotic cells exhibited DNA fragmentation when probed with an in situ end-labeling immunohistochemical method; TUNEL-positive nuclei were also seen in hepatocytes in CD livers which had accumulated large amounts of lipid, consistent with the known DNA-damaging effects of CD. In CS control livers, TGF-beta1 protein was found only in bile duct epithelium and nonparenchymal-type cells, and not in hepatocytes. However, the majority of hepatocytes in the CD liver expressed high levels of TGF-beta1 protein, as well as TGF-beta1 receptor types I and II. Nuclear localization of p27Kip1 protein, which may link TGF-beta1 expression to apoptosis, showed a 10-fold increase in CD hepatocytes (4.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.04% of cells) compared to controls. In addition, there was a 5-fold increase (0.54 +/- 0.031 vs. 0.011 +/- 0.007% of cells) in the mitotic index in CD-compared control livers. We conclude that feeding a CD diet for 6 weeks induces apoptosis in hepatocytes in the whole rat liver and that this form of cell death appears to be mediated, in part, by TGF-beta1 and related proteins.	0

16490355	Changes in gait variability during different challenges to mobility in patients with traumatic brain injury. Postural stability may be compromised in patients who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of the present study was to examine dynamic stability during gait by measuring spatial and temporal variability of foot placement, and to determine the effect of increased difficulty of the walking task on gait variability in patients with TBI. It was hypothesized that patients with TBI will show increased variability in step time, step length, and step width in comparison to healthy controls and that such differences would be accentuated by increased task difficulty. Participants (patients: n=20, controls: n=20) were asked to walk across a pressure sensitive mat at their preferred pace (PW), as fast as possible (FW), and with their eyes closed (EC). In accordance with the hypotheses, patients had significantly greater variability in step time and step length in comparison to healthy controls, and when the complexity of the gait task increased (FW and EC tasks). Although step width variability showed no significant difference between the groups, both control and patient groups had increased step width variability in the EC task. It is proposed that such increases in variability reflect greater challenges to maintaining dynamic stability during gait among individuals with TBI and when performing more difficult tasks.	0
15252475	Supramolecular triangular and linear arrays of metal-radical solids using pyrazolato-silver(I) motifs. New chelating radical ligands pzNNH, pzINH, and pzbisINH (3-pyrazolyl nitronyl nitroxide, 3-pyrazolyl imino nitroxide, and pyrazole-3,5-diyl bis(imino nitroxide), respectively) were prepared. Complexation of these ligands with Ag+ gave [Ag(pzNN)]n, [Ag(pzIN)]6, and [Ag(pzbisIN)]n containing the corresponding anionic forms of the ligands. From the X-ray crystal structure analysis, [Ag(pzIN)]6 was characterized as a dimer of almost planar triangular moieties where the pyrazolate worked as a bridge, and metal-metal bonds brought about dimerization of triangles. [Ag(pzbisIN)]n was characterized as a uniform zigzag chain consisting of pyrazolate bridges and Ag ions with a cis-Npz-Ag-Npz coordination structure. Antiferromagnetic interactions observed could be analyzed based on the structures determined for both compounds. Ferromagnetic coupling was observed in [Ag(pzNN)]n, and a polymeric structure was assumed although the crystal structure could not be determined. Novel supramolecular architectures using pyrazolate-substituted imino nitroxides have been developed, using the unique coordinative versatility of the pyrazolate derivatives	0
12921242	Effects of amphotericin B and caspofungin on histamine expression. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of amphotericin B deoxycholate and caspofungin on the release of histamine from human peripheral blood cells, mononuclear cells, and mast cells. DESIGN: In vitro cell culture experiments. SETTING: University medical center. MATERIAL: Cultured human mononuclear (THP-1) and mast (HMC-1) cells from five healthy volunteers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cultured cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of amphotericin B deoxycholate, diphenhydramine, amphotericin B deoxycholate plus diphenhydramine, caspofungin, caspofungin plus diphenhydramine, and the calcium ionophore A23187 for up to 24 hours. Histamine concentrations and histamine N-methyltransferase activity were determined at various time points throughout exposure. Cell viability was assessed by exclusion of erythrocin B. The A23187 increased histamine concentrations from baseline in peripheral blood and HMC-1 cells. No change in histamine concentrations was observed in response to amphotericin B deoxycholate, whereas caspofungin induced a significant increase in histamine release in peripheral blood cells and HMC-1 cells. No change in histamine concentrations was observed in THP-1 cells in response to any pharmacologic agent tested. Similarly, histamine N-methyltransferase activity in peripheral blood was not affected by amphotericin B deoxycholate, but was significantly decreased by caspofungin. CONCLUSION: Amphotericin B deoxycholate does not affect histamine concentrations or histamine N-methyltransferase activity in whole blood or HMC-1 cells, suggesting that the amphotericin B-induced infusion-related reaction is not a histamine-mediated event. Conversely, caspofungin increased histamine concentrations in whole blood and HMC-1 cells and inhibited histamine N-methyltransferase activity. These data suggest that infusion-related reactions associated with caspofungin may be mediated by histamine release secondary to caspofungin.	0
16102514	Computer simulations of successful defibrillation in decoupled and non-uniform cardiac tissue. AIM: The aim of the present study is to investigate the origin and effect of virtual electrode polarization in uniform, decoupled and non-uniform cardiac tissue during field stimulation. METHODS: A discrete bidomain model with active membrane behaviour was used to simulate normal cardiac tissue as well as cardiac tissue that is decoupled due to fibrosis and gap junction remodelling. Various uniform and non-uniform electric fields were applied to the external domain of uniform, decoupled and non-uniform resting cardiac tissue as well as cardiac tissue in which spiral waves were induced. RESULTS: Field stimulation applied on non-uniform tissue results in more virtual electrodes compared with uniform tissue. The spiral waves were terminated in decoupled tissue, but not in uniform, homogeneous tissue. By gradually increasing local differences in intracellular conductivities, the amount and spread of virtual electrodes increased and the spiral waves were terminated. CONCLUSION: Fast depolarization of the tissue after field stimulation may be explained by intracellular decoupling and spatial heterogeneity present in normal and pathological cardiac tissue. We demonstrated that termination of spiral waves by means of field stimulation can be achieved when the tissue is modelled as a non-uniform, anisotropic bidomain with active membrane behaviour.	0

9337084	Expression and sulfogalactolipid binding specificity of the recombinant testis-specific cognate heat shock protein 70. Immunofluorescent studies with anti-2A antisera, raised specifically against a synthetic C-terminal peptide of native murine P70, the testes-specific cognate heat shock protein 70, demonstrated that the rat homologue of P70 is expressed on the surface of testicular cells. The murine hsp 70.2 gene, encoding P70, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant P70 (rP70) protein with a 6Xhistidine affinity tag at its amino terminus was purified from E. coli via nickel affinity column chromatography. Monoclonal anti-hsp70 antisera and anti-2A antisera cross-reacted with purified rP70. Binding of rP70 was specific for sulfogalactosylceramide (SGC) and sulfogalactosyglycerolipid (SGG). Binding was not inhibited by the sugar, galactose 3'sulfate, nor was binding observed to desulfated derivatives of SGC and SGG, to other negatively charged lipids or other sulfated lipids. Furthermore, rP70 bound to an SGC-column and was eluted only at high salt in combination with high pH. These results show rP70 to possess a specific sulfatide binding site. Since the biochemical properties and immunoreactivity of rP70 are indistinguishable from native P70 and SLIP1 (testicular sulfoglycolipid immobilized protein 1) rP70 can be employed to examine the role of hsp70-mediated sulfatide binding in fertilization.	0

16481017	Awareness of mother-to-child transmission of human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I through breastfeeding in a small group of HTLV-positive women in Maripasoula and Papa  chton, French Guiana. The aim of this study was to assess the awareness of human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) transmission, especially through breastfeeding, in a small group of 40 HTLV-seropositive women in French Guiana and to examine the public health policies in place to reduce transmission. The results show that the majority of HTLV-positive women were aware of having a blood virus, diagnosed antenatally, and were advised to avoid breastfeeding. This advice was followed in the majority of cases despite financial difficulty. Participants were largely unaware of other modes of transmission. Public awareness was low, leading to increased stigmatising of people with HTLV, more so than HIV. Health policies in place to reduce transmission of HTLV are focused on vertical transmission, with women being routinely tested antenatally and advised to avoid breastfeeding. There was no further advice routinely given on other modes of transmission. There was no routine follow-up of HTLV-positive women. Suggestions include public education programmes such as those that are in place for HIV, education of healthcare workers, and setting up a network for systematic follow-up and support of HTLV patients.	0
18469397	Analyzing wet weather flow management using state of the art tools. Optimal secondary clarifier performance is crucial to meet treatment requirements, especially when treating peak wet weather flows (PWWFs), to prevent high effluent suspended solids (ESS) concentrations and elevated sludge blankets. A state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model was successfully used as a design and diagnostic tool to optimize performance for municipal wastewater treatment plants subject to significant PWWFs. Two case studies are presented. For Case Study 1, the model was used to determine the number of secondary clarifiers that will be necessary to treat future PWWF conditions for a plant under design. For Case Study 2, the model was used to identify modifications that are currently being made to increase the clarifier capacity for handling PWWF.	0

11423492	The effect of flexible low glycemic index dietary advice versus measured carbohydrate exchange diets on glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term effect of low glycemic index dietary advice on metabolic control and quality of life in children with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Children with type 1 diabetes (n = 104) were recruited to a prospective, stratified, randomized, parallel study to examine the effects of a measured carbohydrate exchange (CHOx) diet versus a more flexible low-glycemic index (GI) dietary regimen on HbA(1c) levels, incidence of hypo- and hyperglycemia, insulin dose, dietary intake, and measures of quality of life over 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, children in the low-GI group had significantly better HbA(1c) levels than those in the CHOx group (8.05 +/- 0.95 vs. 8.61 +/- 1.37%, P = 0.05). Rates of excessive hyperglycemia (>15 episodes per month) were significantly lower in the low-GI group (35 vs. 66%, P = 0.006). There were no differences in insulin dose, hypoglycemic episodes, or dietary composition. The low-GI dietary regimen was associated with better quality of life for both children and parents. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible dietary instruction based on the food pyramid with an emphasis of low-GI foods improves HbA(1c) levels without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and enhances the quality of life in children with diabetes.	0

10579208	Neuronal activity of the septal pacemaker of theta rhythm under the influence of stimulation and blockade of the median raphe nucleus in the awake rabbit. The control of theta rhythm in neuronal activity of the medial septal area and hippocampal electroencephalogram by the brainstem structures was investigated in waking rabbits. In the first series of experiments stimulating electrodes were implanted into the midbrain reticular formation and median raphe nucleus. The standard frequency of theta-bursts in medial septal area neurons and in the electroencephalogram was uniformly and chronically decreased in all rabbits with electrodes implanted into the median raphe nucleus (4.7 +/- 0.5 Hz versus 5.2 +/- 0.19 Hz in animals without electrodes in median raphe nucleus). Weak electrical stimulation of the median raphe nucleus resulted in additional decrease of theta expression in the medial septal area neurons and its disappearance from the hippocampal electroencephalogram, where it was substituted by delta-waves and spindles. Stimulation of the reticular formation had the opposite effect, with an increase in theta frequency, regularity and expression in medial septal area neuronal activity and hippocampal electroencephalogram. In the second series of experiments reversible functional blockade of the median raphe nucleus by local microinjection of lidocaine was performed. This resulted in expression of theta-bursts in an additional group of medial septal area neurons, an increase in theta-burst frequency (by 0.5-2 Hz) and regularity with concomitant changes in the electroencephalogram. The effects of sensory stimuli on the background of increased theta activity were suppressed or significantly decreased. It is concluded that, in accordance with the data of other authors, the median raphe nucleus can be regarded as a functional antagonist of the reticular formation, powerfully suppressing theta-bursts of the medial septal area neurons and hippocampal theta rhythm. It is suggested that, in combination with the theta-enhancing influences of reticular formation, the median raphe nucleus may participate in termination of attention, its switching to other stimuli and stabilization of the effects of learning.	0

14563006	LISS PLT: design, mechanical and biomechanical characteristics. Following the development of the Less Invasive Sabilization System for Distal Femur a similar system for proximal tibia fractures (LISS PLT) was designed. Anatomical studies were carried out to define the shape of the plate and the position and orientation of the screws. Standard mechanical tests were performed to ensure that the LISS PLT fixation provides similar fatigue resistance to that of conventional plates. Finally, cadaver tibia pairs were used to compare the biomechanical performance of the new device to that of bilateral plating. An unstable intra-articular proximal tibia fracture model was used. The medial condyle of the tibias were submitted to loading cycles with increasing load levels and the vertical subsidence of the medial condyle during the loading cycles was monitored. Comparable stability against secondary loss of reduction was observed for the LISS PLT and the bilateral plating constructs.	0
17067393	Emergence of vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) from a tertiary care hospital from northern part of India. BACKGROUND: Glycopeptides such as vancomycin are frequently the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For the last 7 years incidence of vancomycin intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VISA and VRSA respectively) has been increasing in various parts of the world. The present study was carried out to find out the presence of VISA and VRSA in the northern part of India. METHODS: A total 1681 staphylococcal isolates consisting of 783 S. aureus and 898 coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) were isolated from different clinical specimens from various outpatient departments and wards. All S. aureus and 93 CoNS were subjected to MIC testing (against vancomycin, teicolplanin and oxacillin); Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) vancomycin screen agar test; disc diffusion testing, and PCR for mecA, vanA and vanB genes detection. RESULTS: Out of 783 S. aureus two S. aureus strains were found to be vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant (one strain with MIC 32 microg/ml and the other strain with MIC 64 microg/ml); six strains of S. aureus have shown to be vancomycin intermediate (two strains with MIC 16 microg/ml and four strains with MIC 8 microg/ml); and two strains with teicoplanin intermediate (MIC 16 microg/ml). One CoNS strain was resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin (MIC 32 microg/ml), and two CoNS strains were intermediate to vancomycin and teicoplanin (MIC 16 microg/ml). All VRSA, VISA and vancomycin resistant CoNS had shown growth on BHI vancomycin screen agar (vancomycin 6 microg/ml) and were mecA PCR positive. None of these isolates have demonstrated vanA/vanB gene by PCR. CONCLUSION: The present study reveals for the first time emergence of VISA/VRSA from this part of world and indicates the magnitude of antibiotic resistance in and around the study area. The major cause of this may be unawareness and indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.	0
20800630	Adenovirus serotype 35 vector-induced innate immune responses in dendritic cells derived from wild-type and human CD46-transgenic mice: Comparison with a fiber-substituted Ad vector containing fiber proteins of Ad serotype 35. Recently, much attention has focused on replication-incompetent adenovirus (Ad) vectors containing fiber proteins derived from species B Ad serotype 35 (Ad35) (Ad5F35) and Ad vectors fully constructed from Ad35 as vaccine vectors expressing antigens. However, differences in the transduction properties, including the induction of innate immunity, of Ad5F35 and Ad35 vectors have not been properly and fully examined, partly because the transduction properties of these Ad vectors should be evaluated using nonhuman primates or human CD46-transgenic (CD46TG) mice, which ubiquitously express the primary receptor of Ad35, human CD46, in a pattern similar to that of humans. In the present study, we evaluated innate immune responses of mouse dendritic cells (mDCs) derived from bone marrow cells of wild-type (WT) and CD46TG mice following transduction with Ad serotype 5 (Ad5), fiber-substituted Ad5F35, or Ad35 vectors. Ad5F35 and Ad35 vectors mediated more efficient transduction in mDCs derived from CD46TG mice (CD46TG-mDCs) than did Ad5 vectors. Upregulation of costimulatory molecules and inflammatory cytokine induction by Ad5F35 and Ad35 vectors were significantly higher than those by Ad5 vectors in CD46TG-mDCs. However, the induction properties of the innate immune responses were different between Ad5F35 and Ad35 vectors. Ad35 vectors induced higher levels of costimulatory molecule expression and inflammatory cytokine production than did Ad5F35 vectors in CD46TG-mDCs. Furthermore, intravenous administration of Ad35 vectors in WT and CD46TG mice resulted in higher levels of serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12 compared with administration of Ad5F35 vectors, which exhibited almost mock-transduced levels of these inflammatory cytokines. This study indicates that innate immune responses by Ad35 and Ad5F35 vectors are distinct even although both Ad vectors recognize human CD46 as a receptor.	0

11023531	Bcl-2 rearrangement in patients with chronic hepatitis C associated with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia type II. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is found in 80% to 90% of patients with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC) type II, which is associated with monoclonal IgMk produced by monoclonal B cells. It was investigated whether bcl-2 rearrangement is associated with the clonal B-cell proliferation of EMC induced by hepatitis C. The study groups were composed of 15 patients with HCV and EMC, 12 patients with HCV without EMC, and 7 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) unrelated to HCV. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes was applied to JH and to bcl-2 to study whether JH/bcl-2 translocation was present in these patients. Thirteen of 15 (86%) of patients with HCV-related EMC had the JH/bcl-2 translocation, a significantly higher rate than in HCV patients without EMC (16%; P < .001). Bcl-2 rearrangement was not detected in the patients with CLD not related to HCV. The JH/bcl-2 translocation may constitute a pathogenetic link for the development of NHL in patients with HCV infection. (Blood. 2000;96:2910-2912)	0
15584941	Pharmaceutical care and community pharmacists' understanding of bisphosphonate dosing information. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate pharmacists' knowledge of approved dosing information for cyclic etidronate, alendronate and risedronate in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis; and to assess its relationship to demographic and pharmaceutical care factors. DESIGN: Fax-back questionnaire to evaluate pharmacists' knowledge of approved bisphosphonate dosing information and their involvement in pharmaceutical/patient care activities through independent indices. SETTING: Community pharmacies in both urban and rural settings in British Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Pharmacies surveyed with 22% response rate (163 pharmacists), 47% male and 54% owners/managers. Most were independent (31%) or volunteer chain (28%) pharmacies. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean bisphosphonate dosing knowledge score was 76 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD). Mean scores (+/-SD) for questions pertaining to alendronate (92 +/- 13%) were higher than risedronate (81 +/- 26%) and etidronate (48 +/- 19). Pharmacists were least familiar with approved dosing instructions regarding the lack of need to remain upright after etidronate dosing, spacing out of etidronate from food/antacids/calcium/vitamins, and whether risedronate may be taken at bedtime. Factors found to affect pharmacists' bisphosphonate knowledge scores included employment in higher volume pharmacies and greater number of years in practice. Pharmacists in the upper tertile of pharmaceutical care index scores had similar bisphosphonate knowledge scores to those delivering less pharmaceutical care. Pharmacist gender, being owner/manager, and continuing education hours were not significantly associated with higher knowledge or pharmaceutical care scores. CONCLUSIONS: There is a wide range of knowledge of bisphosphonate dosing and delivery of pharmaceutical care amongst community pharmacists surveyed. Given the importance of proper bisphosphonate dosing to optimize drug absorption and to minimize toxicity, pharmacist education should be a priority.	0
8114761	Functional antagonism between the estrogen receptor and Fos in the regulation of c-fos protooncogene transcription. Estrogen hormones induce transient transcriptional activation of c-fos during the early phases of mitogenic stimulation of target cells. This is mediated by a functional estrogen response element (ERE) that in the human c-fos gene is localized 1kb up-stream of the transcription start site. This is the first known example of transient transcriptional activation induced by a steroid hormone acting via its nuclear receptor. Starting with the hypothesis that the product of c-fos (Fos) interferes with estrogen receptor (ER) activity on this gene promoter, generating in this way a feedback inhibition mechanism responsible for the rapid transcriptional down-regulation detected in vivo, we tested the effects of Fos overexpression on ER-mediated activation of the c-fos promoter in transfected HeLa cells. Transient transfection of an ER expression vector is followed by hormone-dependent trans-activation of reporter genes comprising the c-fos ERE linked to its own promoter. Coexpression of Fos in the cell induces a significant reduction in the activity of ER on the reporter genes. Fos antagonism is effective on both transcription activation functions of the receptor molecule and is independent of the nature of the target promoter. Furthermore, under the same experimental conditions, the estrogen-receptor complex antagonizes activation of an AP-1-responsive test gene by Fos. ER mutants deprived of the DNA-binding domain are efficient inhibitors of Fos activity, indicating that reciprocal antagonism is likely to be mediated by the formation of inactive complexes between the two factors. These results reveal the existence of a functional interference between the ER and Fos for regulation of c-fos protooncogene transcription. It is the first case in which the product of an estrogen-induced growth-related gene is shown to exert a negative feedback control on ER regulation of its own promoter.	1
23124662	Scanning probe electrospray ionization for ambient mass spectrometry. RATIONALE: Ambient sampling and ionization techniques have been attracting attention in imaging mass spectrometry because they offer the advantage of rapid testing. We have developed a method which exploits the fluid motion of charged solvents for both local sampling and ionization with a single vibrating capillary probe. METHODS: The capillary probe was used to supply solvents in order to form a liquid bridge between the probe and a sample surface. A bias voltage was applied to the solvents to generate electrospray ionization (ESI). The probe was also vibrated by either an ultrasonic transducer fixed at the back of the sample (contact-mode) or spontaneous vibration of probe itself (tapping-mode). The ions generated by ESI were detected by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. RESULTS: Sampling of the specimens at the liquid bridge and ESI of the dissolved solutions both occurred around the probe apex. The sampling and ionization co-existed in contact-mode, while they were explicitly separated in the tapping-mode. The one-dimensional mapping of solid samples such as protein films and tissue sections was demonstrated. The results indicated that there was little cross-contamination during the operation. CONCLUSIONS: The method, named scanning probe electrospray ionization (SPESI), promises to be a simple and unique approach toward direct sampling and ionization methodology.	0
21310081	Cumulative smoking exposure, duration of smoking cessation, and peripheral arterial disease in middle-aged and older Korean men. BACKGROUND: We investigated the association of cumulative smoking exposure and duration of smoking cessation with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). METHODS: The study population consisted of 2517 community-dwelling Korean men aged 50 years and older. Information on smoking characteristics such as smoking status, pack-years of smoking, and years since quitting smoking was collected using a standardized questionnaire. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90 in either leg. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence interval) of PAD was 2.31 (1.20-4.42) for former smokers and 4.30 (2.13-8.66) for current smokers, after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors. There was a significant dose-response relationship between pack-years of smoking and PAD. Compared with those who had never smoked, the multivariate-adjusted ORs of PAD for smokers of 0.1-20.0, 20.1-40.0, and >40.0 pack-years were 2.15 (1.06-4.38), 2.24 (1.08-4.65), and 2.93 (1.41-6.09), respectively. There was a significant decrease in PAD risk as the years since quitting smoking increased. The multivariate-adjusted ORs of PAD for 11-20 and >=  21 years smoking cessation were 0.41 (0.19-0.86) and 0.49 (0.24-0.98), compared with current smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative smoking exposure and duration of smoking cessation were significantly associated with PAD in middle aged and older Korean men.	0
18766427	Vertebral \"clover\" scintigraphic image in a vertebral metastasis misdiagnosed with Paget's disease. The diagnosis of Paget's bone disease (PD) is often reached fortuitously with X-ray or scintigraphy. The peculiar distribution of the bone tracer in some skeletal locations, such as vertebra, may be highly suggestive of this disorder. Indeed, there are two distinct vertebral images on the bone scan highly specific of PD: the \"clover\" and the \"heart\" images. It has been previously reported that the specificity of these images for PD diagnosis is very high, nearly 100%, then suggesting that these findings could be patognomonic of this process. We have recently observed a 55-year-old male patient with back pain secondary to a vertebral metastasis due to a hepatocellular carcinoma. Initially, the bone scan showed the characteristic \"clover\" image at T-12 level and he was misdiagnosed with PD. Afterwards, the MRI suggested the diagnosis of a vertebral metastasis, and a computed tomography-guided needle biopsy further confirmed the diagnosis. In view of the present data, this image cannot be considered as patognomonic of PD.	0

21878938	High levels of circulating CD34+ cells at autologous stem cell collection are associated with favourable prognosis in multiple myeloma. BACKGROUND: High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation is a cornerstone in the first-line treatment of multiple myeloma patients. However, only few factors have been identified affecting the outcome in such patients. We hypothesised that varying levels of mobilised CD34+ cells confer prognostic information in myeloma patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. METHODS: We determined circulating CD34+ cells at the day of peripheral stem cell collection in 158 consecutive myeloma patients between January 2001 and August 2010. Patients were stratified into two groups (super vs normal mobilisers) with a cutoff of 100,000 peripheral CD34+ cells per ml. RESULTS: We found that patients with more than 100,000 peripheral CD34+ cells per ml had a better overall survival (P=0.005) and a prolonged time to progression (P=0.0398) than patients with CD34+ cell counts below 100,000 CD34+ cells per ml. High levels of CD34+ cells were an independent marker for better overall survival and time to progression in a multivariate analysis that included disease stage, response at transplant, light-chain subtype, age, sex, and height. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high levels of mobilised peripheral CD34+ cells are associated with favourable outcome in myeloma patients undergoing autologous transplantation.	0
8591809	Do intersections of mortality-rate and survival functions have significance? Common points of intersections have frequently been reported among members of families of linearized mortality-rate and survival functions. A general condition for the existence of such intersections is derived. It is shown that a common point of intersection between straight-line functions exists if and only if the intercepts of the functions are linearly related to their slopes. This slope-intercept condition is applied to a didactic model to illustrate its generality and to three models, the Gompertz-Makeham, the Weibull, and the logistic, which are often used in the analysis of mortality data. The slope-intercept condition for the Gompertz-Makeham mortality-rate model proves to be the well-known Strehler-Mildvan correlation. Families of mortality-rate functions or of the corresponding survival functions but not both may display common points of intersection. Differences between the ages at which survival functions intersect and those at which the associated mortality-rate functions intersect are calculated to be of the order of magnitude of 10 to 20 years. Survival function intersections lie close to the limit of human life span but often arise in consequence of unsupported extrapolations of data obtained at younger ages. These and other results lead to the conclusion that, in themselves, the intersections of survival and mortality-rate functions are not of great importance. To the extent that significance can be attributed to the intersections, it lies in the existence of linear relationships between their slopes and intercepts.	0
21515302	Comparative gene expression profiles induced by PPARy and PPARa/y agonists in rat hepatocytes. Species-differential toxic effects have been described with PPARa and PPARy agonists between rodent and human liver. PPARa agonists (fibrates) are potent hypocholesterolemic agents in humans while they induce peroxisome proliferation and tumors in rodent liver. By contrast, PPARy agonists (glitazones) and even dual PPARa/y agonists (glitazars) have caused idiosyncratic hepatic and nonhepatic toxicities in human without evidence of any damage in rodent during preclinical studies. The mechanisms involved in such differences remain largely unknown. Several studies have identified the major target genes of PPARa agonists in rodent liver while no comprehensive analysis has been performed on gene expression changes induced by PPARy and dual PPARa/y agonists. Here, we investigated transcriptomes of rat hepatocytes after 24h treatment with two PPARy (troglitazone and rosiglitazone) and two PPARa/y (muraglitazar and tesaglitazar) agonists. Although, hierarchical clustering revealed a gene expression profile characteristic of each PPAR agonist class, only a limited number of genes was specifically deregulated by glitazars. Functional analyses showed that many genes known as PPARa targets were also modulated by both PPARy and PPARa/y agonists and quantitative differences in gene expression profiles were observed between these two classes. Moreover, most major genes modulated in rat hepatocytes were also found to be deregulated in rat liver after tesaglitazar treatment. Taken altogether, these results support the conclusion that differential toxic effects of PPARa and PPARy agonists in rodent liver do not result from transcriptional deregulation of major PPAR target genes but rather from qualitative and/or quantitative differential responses of a small subset of genes.	0
8003150	Accelerated rehabilitation for meniscus repairs. Although meniscus tears suitable for repair are infrequent, meniscal repair is preferable to meniscectomy. Unfortunately, the postoperative restrictions commonly recommended preclude the athlete's rapid return to sports and can lead to the selection of meniscectomy over meniscus repair. Wide variations presently exist in the published postmeniscus repair rehabilitation programs. No objective assessment of these variables has been made to date. To assess the value of postoperative limits to motion, weight bearing, and agility activities, a comparison was made of our previously published \"standard\" rehabilitation program with an \"accelerated\" program permitting unlimited weight bearing, full motion, and no restrictions on pivoting sports. Group 1 (58 repairs), treated conventionally, had 11 failures (19%) at an average of 38 months postsurgery. The average age in group 1 was 23 years (range 14-45). Group 2, which included 40 repairs treated with the \"accelerated\" program, had four failures (10%) at an average follow-up of 20 months. The average age in group 2 was 26 years (range 15-40). Arthroscopic second looks were performed in 35% of group 1 and 25% of group 2. These data fail to show any statistical difference and do not support the need for activity restrictions after a meniscus repair.	0

18827633	Radiation effects and radioprotection in MC3T3-E1 mouse calvarial osteoblastic cells. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the mechanisms and treatment of radiation-induced inhibition of craniofacial bone growth. In an earlier study, the radioprotector amifostine (WR-2721) administered to rabbits before irradiation radioprotected cultured orbitozygomatic complex periosteal osteoblast-like cells. This study assessed the effects of amifostine and its active metabolite on the radiation survival, function, and phenotype of mouse calvarial osteoblast-like cells in a cell culture model. METHODS: MC3T3-E1 newborn mouse calvarial osteoblast-like cells underwent gamma-radiation (0 to 10 Gy) in the presence or absence of either WR-2721 or WR-1065, its active metabolite (10 to 10 M). The effects of radiation with and without drugs were assessed using endpoints of colony-forming ability, cell viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, and expression of osteoblastic phenotype genes (alkaline phosphatase, collagen type I, osteocalcin, and osteopontin). All experiments were replicated at least in triplicate. RESULTS: Irradiation resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of clonogenic cell survival. Pretreatment with WR-1065, but not WR-2721, resulted in a significant improvement of osteoblast-like cell survival. Specifically, maximum radioprotection was observed with 10 M WR-1065 at a clinically relevant 2-Gy dose of irradiation. No significant radioprotection was observed at the lower (5 x 10 M) concentration of WR-1065. Furthermore, radiation seemed to suppress the expression of osteoblastic phenotype-related genes in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals improved survival after irradiation in osteoblast-like cells treated with WR-1065 in vitro and corroborates previous findings from animal models. Further studies using this agent and similar drugs are important for devising strategies to prevent radiation-induced inhibition of craniofacial bone growth.	0

20957246	Protein glycosylation--an evolutionary crossroad between genes and environment. The majority of molecular processes in higher organisms are performed by various proteins and are thus determined by genes that encode these proteins. However, a significant structural component of at least half of all cellular proteins is not a polypeptide encoded by a single gene, but an oligosaccharide (glycan) synthesized by a network of proteins, resulting from the expression of hundreds of different genes. Relationships between hundreds of individual proteins that participate in glycan biosynthesis are very complex which enables the influence of environmental factors on the final structure of glycans, either by direct effects on individual enzymatic processes, or by induction of epigenetic changes that modify gene expression patterns. Until recently, the complexity of glycan structures prevented large scale studies of protein glycosylation, but recent advances in both glycan analysis and genotyping technologies, enabled the first insights into the intricate field of complex genetics of protein glycosylation. Mutations which inactivate genes involved in the synthesis of common N-glycan precursors are embryonically lethal. However, mutations in genes involved in modifications of glycan antennas are common and apparently contribute largely to individual phenotypic variations that exist in humans and other higher organisms. Some of these variations can be recognized as specific glyco-phenotypes that might represent specific evolutionary advantages or disadvantages. They are however, amenable to environmental influences and are thus less pre-determined than classical Mendelian mutations.	0

8993332	Selective inhibition of the prothrombinase complex: factor Va alters macromolecular recognition of a tick anticoagulant peptide mutant by factor Xa. The prothrombinase complex assembles through reversible interactions between the protease, factor Xa, the cofactor, factor Va, and acidic phospholipid membranes in the presence of calcium ions. Changes in macromolecular recognition by factor Xa which may result from its interaction with factor Va in the prothrombinase complex have been probed using a recombinant derivative of tick anticoagulant peptide where Arg3 has been replaced with Ala (R3A-TAP). In contrast to the wild type inhibitor, R3A-TAP was a weak competitive inhibitor of factor Xa (Ki = 794 nM). The inhibition of the prothrombinase complex by R3A-TAP was characterized by slow, tight-binding kinetics with an increased affinity of approximately 4000-fold (Ki* = 0.195 nM) relative to that of solution-phase factor Xa. Stopped-flow measurements using p-aminobenzamidine (PAB) demonstrated that the reaction between solution-phase factor Xa and R3A-TAP could be adequately described by a single reversible step with rate constants that were consistent with equilibrium binding measurements. The rate-limiting bimolecular combination of R3A-TAP and factor Xa was competitive with PAB binding of the protease. In contrast, the reaction of R3A-TAP with prothrombinase measured using PAB yielded biphasic stopped-flow traces, indicating a multistep pathway for the reaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme complex. The kinetic measurements were consistent with the initial formation of a ternary complex between R3A-TAP, prothrombinase, and PAB followed by two unimolecular steps which lead to PAB dissociation from the enzyme. In this case, prior occupation of the active site by PAB had no effect on the bimolecular reaction between R3A-TAP and prothrombinase. Thus, the interaction of factor Xa with factor Va on the membrane surface alters recognition of R3A-TAP by the protease, leading to changes in the thermodynamics as well as in the observed kinetic mechanism for the reaction. Therefore, a single amino acid substitution in TAP reveals large changes in macromolecular recognition by factor Xa as a consequence of its interaction with the cofactor within the prothrombinase complex.	0
18091406	Emergency Department greeters reduce door-to-ECG time. INTRODUCTION: Screening for Acute Coronary Syndrome in chest pain patients can be initiated with a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommends getting an ECG performed and reviewed within 10 minutes of the time these patients present to the Emergency Department (ED). One innovative method to improve door-to-ECG time is by placing a trained greeter in the triage section of the ED. METHODS: This study was conducted over a 3-week period from September to October 2006, in a large urban academic medical center. The greeter was stationed in the triage area, and screened every patient entering the ED for the following symptoms/complaints: chest pain, shortness of breath, acute mental status changes in nursing home patients, dizziness, and nausea with or without vomiting in diabetic patients. The greeter obtained the ECG in the qualified patients, or alerted the triage. Data was collected on ECGs for all ED patients who presented with the above complaints in the absence of a greeter. RESULTS: In the 3 weeks of the study, data was collected on 126 cases. The greeter had obtained 40 ECGs, and 86 ECGs were done without the greeter. The average door-to-ECG times were significantly different between the groups. The study found 8.8 minutes in the greeter group versus 29.6 minutes in the nongreeter group (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: ED triage greeter can be effectively used to obtain timely ECGs in suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome patients.	0
19087824	[Prevalence of arterial hypertension and lipid profile in HIV patients]. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is not known whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients present, compared to non-HIV controls, higher vascular risk factors. Our objective was to analyze whether there are differences in blood pressure in HIV patients compared to non-HIV controls. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed all HIV patients controlled in our centre, who were compared with a control group of blood donors, matched for age and sex, blood pressure and lipid profile. We evaluated the following variables: demographic data, date of HIV diagnosis, presence of lipodystrophy, antiretroviral treatment, duration of this treatment, and vascular risk factors. RESULTS: We evaluated 740 patients (mean age: 41.8 years; 75% men). We detected a higher prevalence of hypertension in the HIV group (25% vs. 15%) with a significant difference in the mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure between both groups (p < 0.0001). In the HIV group, hypertensives were older than normotensives, and had higher prevalence of lipodystrophy and higher total cholesterol with a shorter disease duration (75 vs 85 months). In the total group of hypertensives, HIV patients were younger than non-HIV (44.2 vs 47.9 years; p < 0.009) and had higher total cholesterol values (5.44 vs 5.18 mmol/l; p < 0.052). CONCLUSIONS: We found a higher prevalence of hypertension in HIV patients compared with matched controls, as well as a higher prevalence of lipodystrophy and vascular risk factors in hypertensive HIV patients compared with non-hypertensive.	0
12148965	Study of an anaphylactoid reaction to acetaminophen. Generalized itching, urticaria and anaphylactic shock developed in a 9-year-old girl on two separate occasions after she ingested acetaminophen. She was admitted to our hospital for observation during oral challenge. Total eosinophil counts, total serum IgE, IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, and C4, specific IgE antibodies to six common allergens, and skin prick tests to purified acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) were unremarkable. No reaction occurred on open challenge with acetylsalicylic acid and mefenamic acid. However, urticaria and itching sensation occurred 45 min after ingesting 50 mg of purified acetaminophen. Dizziness, shivering, tachycardia and fainting also developed later. These symptoms resolved after treatment with a diphenhydramine injection and intravenous infusion of normal saline. There was a marked increase in the blood histamine level after challenge. In vitro histamine release before oral challenge was also abnormally as high as 50%. In summary, she had an immediate allergic reaction to acetaminophen but was tolerant to acetylsalicylic acid.	0
22202970	Plant exudates promote PCB degradation by a rhodococcal rhizobacteria. Rhodococcus erythropolis U23A is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-degrading bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of plants grown on a PCB-contaminated soil. Strain U23A bphA exhibited 99% identity with bphA1 of Rhodococcus globerulus P6. We grew Arabidopsis thaliana in a hydroponic axenic system, collected, and concentrated the plant secondary metabolite-containing root exudates. Strain U23A exhibited a chemotactic response toward these root exudates. In a root colonizing assay, the number of cells of strain U23A associated to the plant roots (5.7       10    CFU g     ) was greater than the number remaining in the surrounding sand (4.5       10    CFU g     ). Furthermore, the exudates could support the growth of strain U23A. In a resting cell suspension assay, cells grown in a minimal medium containing Arabidopsis root exudates as sole growth substrate were able to metabolize 2,3,4'- and 2,3',4-trichlorobiphenyl. However, no significant degradation of any of congeners was observed for control cells grown on Luria-Bertani medium. Although strain U23A was unable to grow on any of the flavonoids identified in root exudates, biphenyl-induced cells metabolized flavanone, one of the major root exudate components. In addition, when used as co-substrate with sodium acetate, flavanone was as efficient as biphenyl to induce the biphenyl catabolic pathway of strain U23A. Together, these data provide supporting evidence that some rhodococci can live in soil in close association with plant roots and that root exudates can support their growth and trigger their PCB-degrading ability. This suggests that, like the flagellated Gram-negative bacteria, non-flagellated rhodococci may also play a key role in the degradation of persistent pollutants.	0
16400990	[Spore germination and mycelial growth of streptomycetes at different humidity levels]. This study is the first to show the ability of streptomycetes to develop at a very low humidity level. All of the streptomycetes studied produced growth at low humidity (aw 0.86 and 0.67). This capacity was most markedly pronounced in Streptomyces odorifer, whose spores were capable of germinating, and mycelial germs increased in length, at the air humidity aw 0.50. The formation of lateral branches (mycelium branching) at this humidity was noted only in single S. odorifer germs and only after 72 h of incubation. Study of streptomycete growth on an agarized medium with different osmotic pressures, created by various glycerol concentrations in the medium, showed that, at aw 0.67, the spores of all the streptomycetes studied germinate, producing mycelial germs but not microcolonies. The ecological significance of mycelial prokaryotes in soil microbial communities that develop and function under conditions of extremely low humidity is discussed.	0
14578555	Structural changes in the glycosaminoglycan chain of rat skin decorin with growth. Decorin controls collagen fibrilogenesis in skin, and its molecular weight changes in wound healing and with age. In this report, the quantitative and structural changes of decorin were investigated with growth in rat skin from the fetus to the young adult. A northern blot analysis showed that the highest level of skin decorin mRNA was at post partus 0.5 days; this level was about 3.7 times the level at embryo 16.5 days. The mRNA level in the rat skin decreased by 1/5 from post partus 0.5 days until 90 days of age. Western blotting showed that the amount of decorin increased with age in protein level. The molecule size of decorin at embryo 18.5 days was about 110 kDa, and that at post partus 90 days was about 70 kDa. There were no changes in molecular size of its core protein, so the reduction in the size of decorin was dependent on the size of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) as shown by western blot analyses. Electron micrography of the rat skin with cupromeronic blue staining showed that the length of GAG at embryo 18.5 days was about 78.58 +/- 13.94 nm, and that at post partus 90 days was about 54.05 +/- 4.79 nm. The reduction in length of decorin GAG with age shrunk the distance between the collagen fibrils. We suggested that decorin changes the GAG length in order to control skin reconstruction in response to inflammation and injury.	0
12566607	An introductory course for training in endoscopy. Endoscopy practice must respect the ethical aspects of medicine, and the principles of humanism must be reinforced when teaching endoscopy. A well-organized, structured training is essential if we are to ensure that procedures are performed in a safe and effective manner. The most difficult period of training is with the novice endoscopist, so we recommend the introduction of a structured pre-endoscopy training curriculum. This should ideally include introductory lectures and courses, the use of didactic videotapes and training in endoscopy on a computer-based simulator. We also advocate 'train the trainers' international courses to encourage a uniform approach to the teaching of endoscopy. Their aim will be to educate skilled endoscopists in the principles of teaching, which should be thoroughly grounded in the ethics of our profession.	0
7857336	Effects of pidotimod on macrophage functions in methylprednisolone-treated mice. CD-1 mice were treated with methylprednisolone (mPDN) 2-5 mg/kg s.c., for 11 or 6 days, in order to achieve an immunosuppressed state. For the same length of time a group of mice also received pidotimod ((R)-3-[(S)-(5-oxo-2-pyrrolidinyl) carbonyl]-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid. PGT/1A, CAS 121808-62-6) i.p. at 100 or 10 mg/kg. At the end of treatment, peritoneal macrophages (MO) were recovered, purified by adherence to plastic and activated in vitro with different stimuli. After 24 h of incubation, the supernatants were collected and assayed for the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitrite (NO2-), which is the stable derivative of nitric oxide (NO) in acqueous solution. It is well known that TNF-alpha and NO represent two out of many molecules secreted by activated MO which are essential for killing microorganisms and for natural response to infections. It was observed that MO from mPDN-treated mice were unable to produce sufficient levels of both TNF-alpha and NO when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide, IFN-gamma or conidia from an opportunistic fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus, confirming that corticosteroids are able to inhibit the antimicrobial activity of MO. However, MO from mice received mPDN plus pidotimod fully recovered the capacity to produce TNF-alpha and NO in response to the same stimuli. Optimal dose of pidotimod was 100 mg/kg. In addition, pidotimod was also able to reconstitute the cellularity of the peritoneum and of the spleens of mice immunodepressed by mPDN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0

23950945	Extracting labeled topological patterns from samples of networks. An advanced graph theoretical approach is introduced that enables a higher level of functional interpretation of samples of directed networks with identical fixed pairwise different vertex labels that are drawn from a particular population. Compared to the analysis of single networks, their investigation promises to yield more detailed information about the represented system. Often patterns of directed edges in sample element networks are too intractable for a direct evaluation and interpretation. The new approach addresses the problem of simplifying topological information and characterizes such a sample of networks by finding its locatable characteristic topological patterns. These patterns, essentially sample-specific network motifs with vertex labeling, might represent the essence of the intricate topological information contained in all sample element networks and provides as well a means of differentiating network samples. Central to the accurateness of this approach is the null model and its properties, which is needed to assign significance to topological patterns. As a proof of principle the proposed approach has been applied to the analysis of networks that represent brain connectivity before and during painful stimulation in patients with major depression and in healthy subjects. The accomplished reduction of topological information enables a cautious functional interpretation of the altered neuronal processing of pain in both groups.	0
9040054	Ontogeny of sarcoplasmic reticulum protein phosphorylation by Ca2+--calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. In the adult myocardium the Ca2+ uptake and release functions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) are known to be regulated by a membrane-associated Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) which phosphorylates the Ca2+-pumping ATPase (Ca2+ pump), Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor) and the Ca2+ pump-regulatory protein, phospholamban. The role of CaM kinase during development, however, has not been examined previously. The present study investigated the ontogenetic expression of SR-associated CaM kinase in the rabbit myocardium as well as development-related changes in CaM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the SR proteins (Ca2+ pump, Ca2+ release channel and phospholamban) involved in transmembrane Ca2+ cycling. For these experiments, cardiac muscle homogenate and SR-enriched membrane fraction derived from fetal (21- and 28-days gestation), newborn (2 days postnatal) and adult New Zealand White rabbits were used. Western immunoblotting analysis detected the presence of phospholamban, Ca2+ pump and Ca2+ release channel in homogenate and SR at all ages tested. The amount of these proteins in the SR increased substantially during fetal and postnatal development. Phosphorylation studies revealed the presence of CaM kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the Ca2+ pump, Ca2+ release channel and phospholamban as early as 21-days gestation. This phosphorylation could be elicited with the addition of only Ca2+ and calmodulin indicating the presence of a SR-associated CaM kinase as early as 21-days gestation. This was confirmed using a delta-CaM kinase II-specific antibody. Phosphorylation per unit amount of each substrate was greater in the fetus and newborn compared to adult. Phosphorylation of phospholamban could be elicited by exogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at all developmental stages studied. Activation of SR CaM kinase with Ca2+ and calmodulin, or induction of phospholamban phosphorylation by exogenous PKA, resulted in stimulation of the Ca2+ uptake activity of SR in fetal, newborn and adult heart. These results demonstrate early ontogenetic expression of the Ca2+ cycling proteins and CaM kinase in the SR and the concurrent development of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of SR Ca2+ cycling.	0
20432773	What work do assistant practitioners do and where do they fit in the nursing workforce? AIM: To understand where assistant practitioners fit in the workforce and examine the roles they are asked to undertake, by comparing their job descriptions with the policy vision. METHOD: A total of 27 job descriptions from three acute trusts were analysed to highlight similarities and differences between the documents. The analysis focused on how clinical tasks related to the level of responsibility APs were expected to assume as part of their role. RESULTS: The analysis revealed the following categories for APs' job descriptions: fully assistive (one description); supportive/assistive (nine); supportive/substitutive (nine); substitutive/autonomous (seven); and fully autonomous (one). This revealed a number of inconsistencies in the form of different organisational expectations about the AP role. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that it is still not clear what managers and workforce planners want from the AP role as it does not have a clearly defined position in the clinical hierarchy, despite being located at level four on the Skills for Health (2006) framework.	0
19796208	Risk factors for allergic rhinitis in Costa Rican children with asthma. BACKGROUND: Risk factors for allergic rhinitis (AR) in asthmatics are likely distinct from those for AR or asthma alone. We sought to identify clinical and environmental risk factors for AR in children with asthma. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 616 Costa Rican children aged 6-14 years with asthma. Candidate risk factors were drawn from questionnaire data, spirometry, methacholine challenge testing, skin testing, and serology. Two outcome measures, skin test reaction (STR)-positive AR and physician-diagnosed AR, were examined by logistic regression. RESULTS: STR-positive AR had high prevalence (80%) in Costa Rican children with asthma, and its independent risk factors were nasal symptoms after exposure to dust or mold, parental history of AR, older age at asthma onset, oral steroid use in the past year, eosinophilia, and positive IgEs to dust mite and cockroach. Physician-diagnosed AR had lower prevalence (27%), and its independent risk factors were nasal symptoms after pollen exposure, STR to tree pollens, a parental history of AR, inhaled steroid and short-acting beta2 agonist use in the past year, household mold/mildew, and fewer older siblings. A physician's diagnosis was only 29.5% sensitive for STR-positive AR. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for AR in children with asthma depend on the definition of AR. Indoor allergens drive risk for STR-positive AR. Outdoor allergens and home environmental conditions are risk factors for physician-diagnosed AR. We propose that children with asthma in Costa Rica and other Latin American nations undergo limited skin testing or specific IgE measurements to reduce the current under-diagnosis of AR.	0

11142664	Microassay for the detection of elastase activity in the gingival crevice. BACKGROUND, AIMS: A new microassay for the detection of elastase activity (EA) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) has been established. GCF was collected with Periopaper strips and quantified in a Periotron. METHODS: Enzyme activity was measured in a microtiter plate reader, using a fluorometric assay. To ensure quality and precision of the assay, recovery rates were determined at different activities with a recovery of >90%. In a 2nd step, stability of the enzyme was investigated during storage at room temperature, +4 degrees C, -22 degrees C, -88 degrees C. GCF samples retained elastase activity of almost 100% after a storage of 3 days at -22 degrees C. In a group of 12 healthy volunteers, elastase activity was assayed throughout an 18 day experimental gingivitis protocol. RESULTS: Median activity increased from 481 microU/microl at baseline to 1444 microU/microl at day 18, which was accompanied by the development of the signs of gingivitis. The increase of EA during the experimental phase of the study was highly significant (p<0.001) and correlated well with the increasing severity of gingivitis. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that elastase activity in GCF is an excellent quantitative measure of gingival inflammation.	0
14978848	[Prevalence of pure and comorbid mental disorders in Belgium]. OBJECTIVE: To describe the 12-month and lifetime prevalence rates of pure and comorbid mental disorders in Belgium. METHOD: A representative random sample of non-institutionalized inhabitants from Belgium aged 18 or older (N = 2419) was interviewed between April 2001 and June 2002. DSM-IV disorders were assessed by lay interviewers using a revised version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-2000). RESULTS: More than 27% reported a lifetime history of at least one mental disorder; one in nine reported the presence of a mental disorder in the past 12 months. Major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol abuse were the most common lifetime disorders; MDD and specific phobia were most common in the past 12 months. Psychiatric comorbidity was also a common condition. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric disorders in Belgium are frequent. More than two million Belgians have had a mental disorders at a certain moment in their life; more than 800,000 have had a mental disorder in the past 12 months.	0
19452295	The protective role of telmisartan against nephrotoxicity induced by X-ray contrast media in rat model. BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy is a serious complication of diagnostic and interventional procedures. PURPOSE: To evaluate the nephrotoxicity of high- and low-osmolar contrast media (HOCM, LOCM) on kidneys in Sprague-Dawley rats. Telmisartan was administered to confirm its protective role against nephrotoxicity induced by contrast media. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty male rats were randomly divided into six groups (n=10/group). Glycerin was given to all rats except controls to induce renal injury. HOCM (diatrizoate) or LOCM (iohexol) (10 ml/kg b.w., 300 mg I/ml) was given through a caudal vein. Serum creatinine level was measured by an automatical biochemical analyzer. Caspase-3 activity and Angiotensin II (Ang II) level of renal tissue were detected by fluorometric method and radioimmunoassay, respectively. The renal injury was also assessed by hematoxylin and eosin and TdT-mediated deoxyuridine nick end-labeling staining. RESULTS: In diatrizoate-injected rats, serum creatinine level was increased (P<0.001). There was no significant difference between iohexol animals and glycerol controls in the level of serum creatinine. The renal caspase-3 activity and Ang II levels in HOCM and LOCM groups were higher than those in glycerol control group (P<0.001). The percentage of apoptotic tubular cells and pathological scores were lower in the iohexol animals than that in the diatrizoate animals (P<0.001). In the groups pretreated with telmisartan, no increase in the levels of serum creatinine, renal Ang II, and caspase-3 activity was observed (P>0.05). The renal injuries induced by contrast media were alleviated. CONCLUSION: Both HOCM (diatrizoate) and LOCM (iohexol) could cause renal tubular cell apoptosis in the kidneys damaged by glycerin. LOCM was less toxic to rat kidneys than HOCM. Caspase-3 and Ang II might play a role in renal tubular cell apoptosis induced by contrast media. Telmisartan protected the renal tissue from nephrotoxicity induced by contrast media.	0
11070657	FDA and tobacco regulation in the 21st century: where are we headed? In March 2000 the US Supreme Court ruled that the Food and Drug Administration does not have the authority to regulate conventional tobacco products under its existing authorities. While denying the agency authority, the Court also recognized that the case involved one of the most \"troubling health problems facing the nation.\" This commentary maintains that tobacco product regulation and FDA authority over all tobacco products must remain the cornerstone of any effective tobacco control agenda. It explores the ramifications of this decision on the public health, the role and responsibility that now rests with Congress, and the role that public health organizations, including the medical and scientific communities, must now play.	0
16538210	Evaluation of CBASS sequence in degenerative disease of the lumbar spine based on analysis of consecutive 78 cases. BACKGROUND: Despite high efficiency of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in degenerative disease of lumbar spine (DDLS), in many cases its appearance is ambiguous or not compatible with clinical findings. Therefore, different new techniques have been proposed to improve the quality of MR images. One of them is CBASS (Completely Balanced Steady State) sequence. The aim of our study was the evaluation of CBASS sequence in DDLS based on analysis of 78 consecutive cases. MATERIAL/METHODS: The material consists of 78 consecutive patients referred to MR study of the lumbar spine due to low back pain and radicular symptoms. MR examinations, including CBASS sequence, were performed with open low field (0.23 Tesla)MR unit. In all patients, degenerative findings in CBASS and FSE T2-weighted images were scored using 0-3 point scale, and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The superiority of CBASS to FSE T2-weighted images was found in evaluation of disc herniation and bulging disc outlines, the relationship of disc herniation to the dural sac and nerve roots, visualization of the osteophytes, facet joint degeneration and thick- ening of the ligamenta flava. CBASS was inferior in the assessment of the degenerated disc signal and type 1 degenerative changes of the vertebral bodies. CONCLUSIONS: CBASS is superior to T2-weighted images in the evaluation of many symptoms. Therefore, it should be included in routine diagnostic protocol in low-field MR units. In our opinion, CBASS supplements T1-and T2-weighted images in sagittal planes and can entirely replace T2-weighted transverse images.	0

19558506	Two independent gene signatures in pediatric t(4;11) acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. OBJECTIVE: Gene expression profiles become increasingly more important for diagnostic procedures, allowing clinical predictions including treatment response and outcome. However, the establishment of specific and robust gene signatures from microarray data sets requires the analysis of large numbers of patients and the application of complex biostatistical algorithms. Especially in case of rare diseases and due to these constrains, diagnostic centers with limited access to patients or bioinformatic resources are excluded from implementing these new technologies. METHOD: In our study we sought to overcome these limitations and for proof of principle, we analyzed the rare t(4;11) leukemia disease entity. First, gene expression data of each t(4;11) leukemia patient were normalized by pairwise subtraction against normal bone marrow (n = 3) to identify significantly deregulated gene sets for each patient. RESULT: A 'core signature' of 186 commonly deregulated genes present in each investigated t(4;11) leukemia patient was defined. Linking the obtained gene sets to four biological discriminators (HOXA gene expression, age at diagnosis, fusion gene transcripts and chromosomal breakpoints) divided patients into two distinct subgroups: the first one comprised infant patients with low HOXA genes expression and the MLL breakpoints within introns 11/12. The second one comprised non-infant patients with high HOXA expression and MLL breakpoints within introns 9/10. CONCLUSION: A yet homogeneous leukemia entity was further subdivided, based on distinct genetic properties. This approach provided a simplified way to obtain robust and disease-specific gene signatures even in smaller cohorts.	0

8584608	The effects of D1 (NNC 22-0215) and D2 (haloperidol) antagonists in a chronic double-blind placebo controlled trial in cebus monkeys. The effects of chronic treatment for 28 days with the oral D1 (NNC 22-0215) or D2 (haloperidol) antagonist were evaluated in nonhuman primates in a double blind, placebo controlled crossover trial. Cebus monkeys, 10-18 years old, which were previously sensitized to neuroleptics, were treated in three different groups with NNC 22-0215 2-3 mg/kg PO (n = 6), haloperidol 2-3 mg/kg PO (n = 5), or lactose placebo (n = 7) each day in a banana slice. At the end of 28 days the NNC 22-0215 group crossed over to haloperidol and the haloperidol group crossed over to NNC 22-0215 for 28 more days. The lactose group continued on lactose. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) of dystonia and sedation were scored daily. Initially both NNC 22-0215 and haloperidol produced equal rates of dystonia. However, the NNC 22-0215 group demonstrated nearly full desensitization by day 2 and showed no EPS by day 6, whereas the haloperidol group had increased EPS during the first week, followed by moderate desensitization to EPS, but continued to have symptoms on each of the 28 days of treatment. At crossover, the previously treated haloperidol group rapidly desensitized with NNC 22-0215 by day 4 to show no EPS, whereas the previously treated NNC 22-0215 group showed full EPS on the first day of haloperidol and had EPS continue over the next 28 days of treatment. Sedation from NNC 22-0215 also desensitized within the first week of treatment. Haloperidol produced minimal sedation that did not change. The profound difference in rates of desensitization between repeated D1 and D2 antagonist treatment suggests that D1 antagonists in the clinic may produce EPS side effects for only the first few days, in contrast to the continuous acute EPS associated with chronic neuroleptic treatment.	0
15139064	Yttrium-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy in Richter syndrome. BACKGROUND: (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan is a radioimmunotherapeutic construct that is reported to be an effective treatment for patients with lymphoma. The aim of the current analysis was to evaluate retrospectively the efficacy and safety of (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with Richter syndrome (RS). METHODS: Patients with histologically proven CD20-positive RS and < 25% lymphoma and/or chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the bone marrow were treated. Patients received an imaging dose of (111)In-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan of 1.6 mg (5.0 mCi of (111)In) intravenously. One week later, they received 0.3 or 0.4 mCi/kg of (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan. Rituximab, at a dose of 250 mg/m(2) intravenously, was given immediately before ibritumomab tiuxetan on Days 1 and 8. RESULTS: Seven patients were treated. Their median age was 56 years (range, 44-70 years). The median time to transformation was 7.9 years (range, 0.7-28.4 years). The median number of previous therapies received was five (range, one to seven previous therapies). The median number of previous therapies received for RS was one (range, none to three previous therapies). Six patients were treated previously with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside. No patient responded to (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan therapy. All patients developed disease progression. The median time to disease progression was 41 days (range, 39-89 days). Side effects included hematologic toxicity. Grade 3-4 (according to the second version of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria) thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 5 patients (71%) and 2 patients (29%), respectively. There was one episode of septic shock in a patient with Grade 4 neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan had no significant antitumor activity and hematologic toxicity was severe in these heavily pretreated patients with RS.	0

12702312	Aspergillus oryzae in solid-state and submerged fermentations. Progress report on a multi-disciplinary project. We report the progress of a multi-disciplinary research project on solid-state fermentation (SSF) of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae. The molecular and physiological aspects of the fungus in submerged fermentation (SmF) and SSF are compared and we observe a number of differences correlated with the different growth conditions. First, the aerial hyphae which occur only in SSFs are mainly responsible for oxygen uptake. Second, SSF is characterised by gradients in temperature, water activity and nutrient concentration, and inside the hyphae different polyols are accumulating. Third, pelleted growth in SmF and mycelial growth in SSF show different gene expression and protein secretion patterns. With this approach we aim to expand our knowledge of mechanisms of fungal growth on solid substrates and to exploit the biotechnological applications.	0

6546805	Anthelmintic effect of levamisole, ivermectin, albendazole and fenbendazole on larval Toxocara canis infection in mice. The anthelmintic effects of levamisole (100-50 mg kg-1 live bodyweight), ivermectin (2 mg kg-1 bodyweight), albendazole and fenbendazole (both 100 mg kg-1 bodyweight), were tested against second stage Toxocara canis larvae in mice. Anthelmintic treatment on days 2 to 7 after infection inclusive resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) retention of larvae in the liver, and fewer larvae migrated subsequently to the brain and the musculature of treated mice compared to untreated controls. Most of the larvae retained in the liver subsequently died there and were not recoverable by day 35 after infection, causing significant (P less than 0.05) reduction in the total larval recoveries compared to the controls. The oral route of drug administration caused higher larval retention in the liver than the subcutaneous route. All infected levamisole treated mice survived for four months, whereas half the similarly infected but untreated mice died within the same period. Treatment on days 8 to 13 inclusive after infection had no effect on second stage T canis larvae suggesting that once the larvae have reached the brain and musculature they are not susceptible to anthelmintic agents.	0
22753280	Extended release quetiapine fumarate in major depressive disorder: analysis in patients with anxious depression. BACKGROUND: A pooled analysis was performed on data from two studies evaluating the efficacy of once-daily extended-release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) monotherapy for patients with major depressive disorder. Through these analyses (based on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) measures), we aim to further evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine XR in depressed patients with high levels of anxiety symptoms. METHODS: Secondary analyses were conducted of pooled individual patient data from two 8-week (6-week randomized phase, 2-week drug discontinuation phase), double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of quetiapine XR (50-300 mg/day). Outcomes included change from randomization at Week 6 in Montgomery   sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score for patients with anxious and nonanxious depression. RESULTS: Of 968 patients included in the analysis, 788 (81.4%) were classified as anxious depressed (defined as HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor score >=  7) and 180 (18.6%) were nonanxious. For patients with anxious depression and nonanxious depression, statistically significant differences versus placebo in MADRS total score were recorded for quetiapine XR 150 mg/day (-3.24, P < .001 and -4.82, P < .01, respectively) and 300 mg/day (-3.57, P < .001 and -3.39, P < .05, respectively) at Week 6. In the second analysis using an alternate definition of anxious depression (baseline HAM-A total score >=  20), quetiapine XR 150 and 300 mg/day resulted in significant differences versus placebo in MADRS total score reduction in patients with high and lower levels of anxiety. The adverse event (AE) profile was similar irrespective of baseline anxiety levels, although patients with anxious depression reported a somewhat greater incidence of AEs. CONCLUSION: Quetiapine XR monotherapy improved symptoms of depression in patients with higher and lower levels of anxiety.	0
8914041	Evidence of taurine depletion and accumulation of cysteinesulfinic acid in chronic dialysis patients. Methionine, taurine and cysteinesulfinic acid (CSA) were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in plasma from ten patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) and eight patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The patients' data were compared with data obtained from ten healthy controls. Significant reductions in plasma taurine levels were observed in the HD patients (34 +/- 13 mumol/liter, mean +/- SD) and the CAPD patients (47 +/- 12 mumol/liter) compared to the controls (66 +/- 5 mumol/liter), while the CSA levels were markedly higher in the HD patients (9.1 +/- 2.8 mumol/liter) and the CAPD patients (9.1 +/- 2.4 mumol/liter) than in the controls (0.79 +/- 0.15 mumol/liter). A single HD treatment significantly reduced the plasma taurine and CSA concentrations (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001), respectively. The plasma methionine levels were normal in both patient groups. The finding of a low plasma taurine level and a large accumulation of CSA suggests that the metabolic conversion of CSA to taurine is impaired in uremic patients and this metabolic abnormality may cause taurine depletion.	0
18178130	The manifold phospholipases A of Legionella pneumophila - identification, export, regulation, and their link to bacterial virulence. The intracellular lung pathogen Legionella pneumophila expresses secreted and cell-associated phospholipase A (PLA) and lysophospholipase A (LPLA) activities belonging to at least three enzyme families. The first family consists of three secreted PLA and LPLA activities displaying the amino acid signature motif 'GDSL'; PlaA, PlaC and PlaD. The second group contains the cell-associated and very potent PLA/LPLA, PlaB. The third group, the patatin-like proteins, comprises 11 members. One patatin-like protein, PatA/VipD, shows LPLA and PLA activities and interferes with vesicular trafficking when expressed in yeast and therefore is possibly involved in the intracellular infection process. Likewise, members of the first two phospholipase families have roles in bacterial virulence because phospholipases are important virulence factors that have been shown to promote bacterial survival, spread and host cell modification/damage. The GDSL enzyme PlaA detoxifies cytolytic lysophospholipids, and PlaB shows contact-dependent haemolytic activity. PlaC acylates cholesterol, a lipid present in eukaryotic hosts but not in the bacterium. Many of the L. pneumophila PLAs are exported by the type II Lsp or the type IVB Dot/Icm secretion systems involved in virulence factor export. Moreover, the regulation of lipolytic activities depends on the transcriptional regulators LetA/S and RpoS, inducing the expression of virulence traits, and on posttranscriptional activators like the zinc metalloprotease ProA.	0
9783528	Barriers to tuberculosis control in urban Zambia: the economic impact and burden on patients prior to diagnosis. SETTING: Chest Clinic, University Teaching Hospital, Zambia. OBJECTIVE: To study the pre-diagnosis economic impact, burden, and barriers to care-seeking for tuberculosis patients in urban Zambia. DESIGN: In-depth interviews conducted over a 9-week period with adult in-patients and out-patients registering with new pulmonary tuberculosis; data analysis using Epi Info. RESULTS: Interviews were completed by 202 patients: 64% normally worked, but 31% stopped due to their tuberculosis, with an average of 48 days off. The mean duration of illness prior to their tuberculosis registration was 63 days, with 64% of patients delaying in presenting to the Chest Clinic. Of these, 38% blamed money shortages for their delay. In seeking diagnosis, patients incurred a mean total cost equivalent to 127% of their mean monthly income (pounds sterling UK 40 [ US 59]); direct expenditures represented 60% of this cost. In addition, patients lost, on average, 18 work days prior to diagnosis. Care-givers incurred costs equivalent to 31% of the mean monthly income (pounds sterling UK 10 [ US 15]). CONCLUSION: The economic burden of tuberculosis on patients creates barriers to prompt diagnosis which may lead to continuing transmission of the infection. Important economic barriers include transportation expenditure, cost of 'special food', and lost income. These barriers may be reduced through interventions that reduce the number of health encounters, travel distances and duration of illness before diagnosis.	0
17968947	Association between friction and wear in diarthrodial joints lacking lubricin. OBJECTIVE: The glycoprotein lubricin (encoded by the gene Prg4) is secreted by surface chondrocytes and synovial cells, and has been shown to reduce friction in vitro. In contrast to man-made bearings, mammalian diarthrodial joints must endogenously produce friction-reducing agents. This study was undertaken to investigate whether friction is associated with wear. METHODS: The lubricating ability of synovial fluid (SF) samples from humans with genetic lubricin deficiency was tested in vitro. The coefficient of friction in the knee joints of normal and lubricin-null mice was measured ex vivo; these joints were also studied by light and electron microscopy. Atomic force microscopy was used to image and measure how lubricin reduces friction in vitro. RESULTS: SF lacking lubricin failed to reduce friction in the boundary mode. Joints of lubricin-null mice showed early wear and higher friction than joints from their wild-type counterparts. Lubricin self-organized and reduced the work of adhesion between apposing asperities. CONCLUSION: These data show that friction is coupled with wear at the cartilage surface in vivo. They imply that acquired lubricin degradation occurring in inflammatory joint diseases predisposes the cartilage to damage. Lastly, they suggest that lubricin, or similar biomolecules, will have applications in man-made devices in which reducing friction is essential.	0
17353285	Complement receptor 3 and Toll-like receptor 4 act sequentially in uptake and intracellular killing of unopsonized Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by human neutrophils. The uptake and subsequent killing of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by human neutrophils was studied. In particular, two pattern recognition receptors, complement receptor 3 (CR3) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), were found to be essential for the efficient uptake and activation, respectively, of the NADPH oxidase. The uptake of Salmonella was almost completely inhibited by various monoclonal antibodies against CR3, and neutrophils from a patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1, which lack CR3, showed almost no uptake of Salmonella. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutant strain of Salmonella was used to show that the expression of full-length, wild-type, or so-called smooth LPS is important for the efficient killing of intracellular Salmonella. Infection with wild-type-LPS-expressing Salmonella resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TLR4-decorated, Salmonella-containing vacuoles, whereas ROS were not induced by an LPS mutant strain. In addition, the recognition of Salmonella by neutrophils, leading to ROS production, was shown to be intracellular, as determined by priming experiments with intact bacteria under conditions where the bacterium is not taken up. Finally, the generation of ROS in the wild-type-Salmonella-infected neutrophils was largely inhibited by the action of a TLR4-blocking, cell-permeable peptide, showing that signaling by this receptor from the Salmonella-containing vacuole is essential for the activation of the NADPH oxidase. In sum, our data identify the sequential recognition of unopsonized Salmonella strains by CR3 and TLR4 as essential events in the efficient uptake and killing of this intracellular pathogen.	0

15117684	What's new about the \"new public health\"? From its origins, when public health was integral to societies' social structures, through the sanitary movement and contagion eras, when it evolved as a separate discipline, to the \"new public health\" era, when health promotion projects like Healthy Cities appear to be steering the discipline back to society's social structure, public health seems to have come full circle. It is this observation that has led some to ask, \"What's new about the 'new public health'?\" This article addresses the question by highlighting what is new about the health promotion era-including adapted components of previous eras that have been incorporated into its core activities-and its suitability in addressing established and emerging public health threats.	0
8001883	Relationship of corticoclaustral axon terminals to neurons of the claustrum in the cat. A dark type degeneration of axon terminals was observed in the dorsocaudal part of the claustrum following lesions of the visual cortex. Most of the degenerating axon terminals had synapses mainly with dendritic spines (64.1%) and small dendrites (25.1%). Only 5.8% of degenerating axon terminals formed synaptic contacts with medium-sized dendrites, 1.0% with large dendrites and 0.5%--with other parts of the claustral neurons. 3.5% of degenerating axon terminals were observed to form a contact with more than one postsynaptic structure. Degenerating axon terminals displayed synaptic contacts exclusively of asymmetrical type with clearly identifiable postsynaptic densities which suggest corticoclaustral afferents to be excitatory. Our data strongly support the notion that there are direct synaptic contacts between the ascending arm of the corticoclaustral neuronal loop.	0
18375788	Normalization of microRNA expression levels in quantitative RT-PCR assays: identification of suitable reference RNA targets in normal and cancerous human solid tissues. Proper normalization is a critical but often an underappreciated aspect of quantitative gene expression analysis. This study describes the identification and characterization of appropriate reference RNA targets for the normalization of microRNA (miRNA) quantitative RT-PCR data. miRNA microarray data from dozens of normal and disease human tissues revealed ubiquitous and stably expressed normalization candidates for evaluation by qRT-PCR. miR-191 and miR-103, among others, were found to be highly consistent in their expression across 13 normal tissues and five pair of distinct tumor/normal adjacent tissues. These miRNAs were statistically superior to the most commonly used reference RNAs used in miRNA qRT-PCR experiments, such as 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA, or total RNA. The most stable normalizers were also highly conserved across flash-frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung cancer tumor/NAT sample sets, resulting in the confirmation of one well-documented oncomir (let-7a), as well as the identification of novel oncomirs. These findings constitute the first report describing the rigorous normalization of miRNA qRT-PCR data and have important implications for proper experimental design and accurate data interpretation.	0

10426193	Differential regulation of transforming growth factor receptors by angiotensin II and transforming growth factor-beta1 in vascular smooth muscle. Angiotensin II (Ang II) and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1 play a role in vascular remodeling in hypertension. In this process they may interact on various levels, including that of receptor regulation. This consideration prompted the present study on transcriptional regulation of TGF-beta receptors by Ang II and TGF-beta in vascular smooth muscle cells. Transcriptional expression of the components of the TGF-beta system was demonstrated for TGF-beta and for TGF-beta receptors I, II, and III. As measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, TGF-beta mRNA increased about 2.4-fold in the presence of 40 pM exogenous TGF-beta. Ang II at 10(-6) M increased TGF-beta mRNA 2.5-fold compared to control cells (P<0.05). Ang II also significantly increased TGF-beta protein concentration in the supernatant of confluent vascular smooth muscle cells. Ang II caused the induction of TGF-beta, but short-term experiments showed TGF-beta receptor II mRNA to be differentially regulated by Ang II and TGF-beta; while TGF-beta caused a 40% decrease in TGF-beta receptor II mRNA after 4 h (P<0.05), Ang II caused an increase by about 70%. In contrast, both TGF-beta and Ang II increased TGF-beta receptor I mRNA to about 260% or 180% of controls (P<0.05). TGF-beta effects were abrogated by coincubation with a TGF-beta neutralizing antibody, and Ang II effects were abrogated by losartan, an AT-1 receptor antagonist. Coincubation of Ang II with the TGF-beta neutralizing antibody did not inhibit the effect of Ang II, indicating that the short-term effects of Ang II on the expression of the TGF-beta receptors are not mediated via TGF-beta. Furthermore, Ang II stimulated DNA synthesis even in the presence of the TGF-beta neutralizing antibody. In conclusion, this study indicates (a) that in vascular smooth muscle TGF-beta receptors are regulated on the RNA level by TGF-beta and Ang II, and (b) that Ang II dependent regulation of TGF-beta receptors is at least partially independent of endogenous TGF-beta. Stimulation of the transcriptional expression of TGF-beta receptors by Ang II may increase sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle cells to TGF-beta.	0
9484698	Perceptions of parental bonding in patients with various personality disorders, lifetime depressive disorders, and healthy controls. The aims of the present study was (a) to examine the relationship between parental bonding and various personality disorders, when the effect of a lifetime depressive disorder was statistically controlled for, and (b) to examine the relationship between parental bonding and a lifetime depressive disorder when the effects of various personality disorders were accounted for. The study included 135 psychiatric outpatients and 41 healthy controls. The patients were diagnosed according to DSM-III-R axis I and axis II. Results indicated that obsessive-compulsive personality disorder was associated with reports of lower levels of paternal care and higher levels of paternal overprotection, while cluster B personality disorder was associated with reports of high parental overprotection. Avoidant, dependent, and cluster A personality disorders were not associated with abnormal parental bonding. Lifetime depressive disorders were associated with reports of low maternal care and high maternal overprotection when the effect of a personality disorder was accounted for.	0

11392579	Analysis of montelukast in mild persistent asthmatic patients with near-normal lung function. Few studies have specifically evaluated controller therapy in patients with mild persistent asthma. We used a subgroup analysis to investigate the effects of montelukast, a potent cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, on adult patients on the milder end of the asthma severity spectrum. We have identified seven double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of adult patients with mild-to-moderate chronic asthma in which montelukast was investigated. Subsets of patients with baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) > 80% and > 75% predicted or further restricted by less than daily rescue beta-agonist use were included as four cohorts (A, B, C, D), and efficacy measures, including change in FEV1 rescue-free days, beta-agonist use, nocturnal awakenings and blood eosinophil counts were evaluated. Cohorts A to D comprised 21%, 8%, 11%, and 4%, respectively, of patients from these studies. Mean pretreatment FEV1 ranged from 81% to 84% predicted and daily beta-agonist use from 2.4 to 4.5 puffs day(-1) in the four cohorts. Pooled results demonstrated a treatment effect for montelukast over placebo in all cohorts, for all endpoints. There was a significant improvement in FEV1 in montelukast-treated patients (7-8% over baseline) compared with placebo (1-4% over baseline, between-group difference P < or = 0.02) for all cohorts. Similarly, the percentage of rescue-free days increased substantially more with montelukast (22-30%) than with placebo (8-13%). This subgroup analysis indicates that montelukast produced improvements in parameters of asthma control in patients with milder persistent asthma that should be confirmed in additional prospective trials.	0

8552205	In vitro antileukemic activity and chemical transformation of the 5'-chloro-5'-deoxy derivative of cyclocytidine. Hydrochloride of 5'-chloro-5'-deoxy-cyclocytidine (Cl-cC) is an analogue of cyclocytine hydrochloride (cC), a prodrug of the compound with the strong antileukemic activity arabinosylcytosine (araC). This paper is devoted to the study of its cytotoxic activity in vitro and to the effect of acid and alkaline conditions and temperature on its stability. Cl-cC inhibits not only the growth of L1210 leukemia cells in vitro and the DNA synthesis (IC50 = 0.09 mumol/l) but, at the same time, it has a weak effect on RNA synthesis (IC50 > 250 mumol/l) and no effect on proteosynthesis. In alkaline conditions Cl-cC is transformed to 5'-chloro-araC and 2',5'-anhydro-araC but is more stable in acid solutions.	0
16937444	Growth hormone regulates intestinal ion transport through a modulation of the constitutive nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide-cAMP pathway. AIM: Growth hormone (GH) directly interacts with the enterocyte stimulating ion absorption and reducing ion secretion induced by agonists of cAMP. Since nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the regulation of transepithelial ion transport and acts as a second messenger for GH hemodynamic effects, we tested the hypothesis that NO may be involved in the resulting effects of GH on intestinal ion transport. METHODS: Electrical parameters reflecting trans-epithelial ion transport were measured in Caco-2 cell monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers and exposed to GH and cholera toxin (CT) alone or in combination, in the presence or absence of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Similar experiments were conducted to determine cAMP and nitrite/nitrate concentrations. NOS expression was assayed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: L-NAME causes total abrogation of absorptive and anti-secretory effects by GH on intestinal ion transport. In addition, L-NAME was able to inhibit the GH-effects on intracellular cAMP concentration under basal conditions and in response to CT. GH induced a Ca(2+)-dependent increase of nitrites/nitrates production, indicating the involvement of the constitutive rather than the inducible NOS isoform, which was directly confirmed by Western blot analysis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the GH effects on intestinal ion transport, either under basal conditions or in the presence of cAMP-stimulated ion secretion, are mediated at an intracellular level by the activity of cNOS.	0
20073357	Leadership wisdom. Becoming a good leader starts with effectively leading yourself. Good leadership flows from good followership. While leaders need to be adaptive, they need to make sure that change is actually necessary and not merely the illusion of progress. Effective juggling of leadership responsibilities requires identifying the glass balls and making sure that they do not drop. Leaders need to be visible and be out front, especially when things get rough or when they are the most perilous. Anger should never be allowed to reign and cloud a leader's judgment. Leadership is not \"one size fits all,\" those being led are unique and, consequently, different approaches will be necessary to properly motivate followers. When considering important leadership decisions, it is advisable to seek out your own Napoleon's Corporal to be sure that your plan is sound and those who will implement it do in fact fully understand it. Genuine belief in your Soldiers is the most powerful and lasting thing that you can express as a leader. Lastly, mentoring is a solemn responsibility of leaders that must never be eclipsed by the many literal and figurative battles of the day.	0
17461296	[Cardiometabolic effects of rimonabant in obese/overweight subjects with dyslipidaemia or type 2 diabetes]. Rimonabant (Acomplia) is the first selective CB1 receptor blocker of the endocannabinoid system. It has been evaluated in the RIO (\"Rimonabant In Obesity and related disorders\") programme including above 6.600 overweight/obese patients with or without comorbidities followed for 1 to 2 years. Compared to placebo, rimonabant 20 mg/day consistently increases weight loss, reduces waist circumference, increases HDL cholesterol, lowers triglyceride levels, diminishes insulin resistance, and reduces the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. In patients with type 2 diabetes, rimonabant also diminishes HbA1c levels, an effect confirmed in the recent SERENADE trial. Almost half of the metabolic effects occurs beyond weight loss, suggesting direct peripheral effects of rimonabant. Rimonabant is indicated in Europe as an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of obese patients, or overweight patients with associated risk factor(s), such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia.	0

15792529	Bilateral reversible deafness after surgery for unilateral epidermoid tumor: an unusual complication: case report. OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We present an unusual complication of bilateral hearing loss after surgery for unilateral epidermoid tumor situated at the right pontocerebellar junction. The neurosurgeon must know the possible causes of this catastrophic complication and should take every possible measure to avoid it. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old male patient presented with progressive hearing loss in the right ear. A radiological examination demonstrated a mass lesion at the right pontocerebellar junction. A pure tone audiogram revealed sensorineural hearing impairment of the right ear. A brainstem auditory evoked potential test confirmed this with reduced amplitudes and a prolonged I-V interval. INTERVENTION: The patient was operated on via a right paramedian suboccipital craniectomy. The tumor was completely excised, and all of the cranial nerves were preserved during the operation. Postoperatively, the patient developed total bilateral hearing loss, which improved significantly over time. CONCLUSION: Controlled cerebrospinal fluid drainage during exposure and tumor excision may reduce the possibility of shift and traction on the neural structures and help to prevent ischemic injury. Frequent irrigation of the surgical field and minimizing the spilling of the tumor contents may reduce the risk of chemical irritation. The use of corticosteroids may also help during the postoperative period.	0
9455610	Biochemical markers of bone metabolism: an overview. OBJECTIVES: An overview of biochemical markers of bone metabolism is presented along with indications for their clinical utilization. DESIGN AND METHODS: The structure, cyclical metabolism, and hormone regulation of bone is reflected by markers of resorption, formation and/or turnover. Markers of resorption representing degradation of type 1 collagen, include N-telopeptides, C-telopeptides, hydroxyproline, and the collagen crosslinks pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline; acid phosphatase, a marker of osteoclast activity, and urinary calcium are also indicators of bone resorption. Bone formation markers indicate osteoblast activity; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and the N-terminal and C-terminal extension peptides of procollagen reflect formation of organic matrix in bone. Osteocalcin, produced by osteoblasts but also released during osteoclastic degradation, may indicate either formation when resorption and formation are coupled or turnover when they are uncoupled. RESULTS: Bone markers respond to intervention more rapidly than techniques such bone mineral density. Resorption markers respond approximately 1 to 3 months after intervention; markers of formation respond later, after 6 to 9 months. Bone markers may add useful information for assessing fracture risk and for monitoring osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, cancer metastasis, and metabolic disease. Various therapeutic interventions may affect release of some bone markers. CONCLUSION: Bone disease has high prevalence in adults so bone markers will become even more important for assessing fracture risk and monitoring therapy as populations age. Characteristics of bone markers are dependent on biology and the assay used. Substantial work remains in characterizing existing assays, identifying better markers and performing the clinical studies to define which bone markers should be measured and when.	0
17315482	[Redescription of the female of Lutzomyia vattierae (Diptera: Psychodidae, Phlebotominae) from the serran  a de La Macarena, Central Colombia]. INTRODUCTION: Lutzomyia species of the subgenus Sciopemyia show restricted distribution and are rarely represented in sand fly captures, with the exception of L. sordellii, which is found from Costa Rica to Argentina. To date, only two of these species. L. sordellii and L. preclara have been reported in Colombia. OBJECTIVE: The female of L. vattierae was redescribed and the record of this Sciopemyia species established for in the Colombian national park, serran  a de La Macarena. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in the Serrania de La Macarena, in western province of Meta. The serrania is a small mountain range situated between the Orinoco and Amazon River basins and geographically separated from the Andes. Sand flies were collected during two consecutive nights with a CDC light trap placed from 18:00 to 06:00 hours in a primary forest. RESULTS: Four females belonging to the subgenus Sciopemyia were identified as L. vattierae, which differs from L. preclara by the presence of papillae on the third flagellomere and from L. sordellii by the form and length of the spermathecae and individual sperm ducts. CONCLUSION: The number of known species of Sciopemyia in Colombia is now three and include L. sordellii, L. preclara, and L. vattierae.	0

12126242	A multinational comparison of racecadotril and loperamide in the treatment of acute watery diarrhoea in adults. BACKGROUND: Racecadotril (acetorphan) is an orally active, potent inhibitor of enkephalinase, which exerts an antihypersecretory effect without increasing intestinal transit time. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability of racecadotril with those of loperamide by assessing their effects on the resolution of the signs and symptoms of diarrhoea in patients in developing countries who had acute watery diarrhoea of less than 5 days' duration. METHODS: 945 outpatients from 21 centres in 14 countries received racecadotril (100 mg) or loperamide (2 mg) three times daily in a single-blind study. Duration of diarrhoea was the primary measure of efficacy; secondary criteria were overall clinical response, occurrence and duration of abdominal pain and distension, and occurrence of other associated signs and symptoms. Occurrence of constipation and adverse events were the main safety assessments. RESULTS: Diarrhoea resolved rapidly with both racecadotril and loperamide (55.0 h in both groups), 92% of patients on racecadotril and 93% on loperamide being treatment successes. Racecadotril produced a significantly greater reduction in abdominal pain and distension than loperamide (P = 0.024 and 0.03, respectively). The duration of abdominal distension was significantly shorter with racecadotril (5.4 versus 24.4 h; P = 0.0001), and constipation was also significantly less frequent (16% versus 25%; P = 0.001). One-hundred-and-eighty patients (19%) experienced one or more adverse event during the study: 67 (14.2%) in the racecadotril group and 113 (23.9%) in the loperamide group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Racecadotril resolved the symptoms of acute diarrhoea rapidly and effectively, and produced more rapid resolution of abdominal symptoms and less constipation than loperamide.	0

8184479	Cyclosporine enhances the synthesis of selected extracellular matrix proteins by renal cells \"in culture\". Different cell responses and phenotype characterization. Glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis are 2 major side effects of protracted therapy with CsA in heart transplant patients and in nonrenal immunologic diseases. To investigate whether there is any cause-effect correlation between CsA and the synthesis of extracellular matrix in the kidney, we determined the amount and composition of collagens produced by various renal cells \"in culture\" upon exposure to increasing levels of CsA. The cellular models we used included primary cultures of both human and rat mesangial cells (hMC, rMC), human and rat renal fibroblasts (hFib, rFib), and human tubular epithelia as well as cell lines of rat renal fibroblasts (NRK49F) and of tubular epithelia (NRK52E). In the case of primary cell cultures, CsA induced a marked increment of total collagen synthesis. This was highest for renal fibroblasts (+330% hFib, +110% rFib), followed by rMC (+170%), hMC (+100%), and human tubular epithelia (+130%). At the highest dosage of CsA (5 ng/ml), this corresponded to a net increment in collagen III synthesis by both hMC and hFib (+150% and +300%), while collagen I and collagen IV were unaffected. On hMC, CsA also induced a maximal increase in a component with 70 kDa molecular mass, which was produced only in a negligible amount by these cells in standard conditions. This low molecular mass collagen was tentatively characterized by cyanogen-bromide digestion and fingerprint analysis as a novel molecule showing a peptide composition without comparable features for any reported collagen map. NRK49F and NRK52E cell lines were not affected by CsA. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that CsA is able to induce the synthesis of specific collagens, mainly of collagen III and of a 70-kDa component, by various renal cells in cultures. Since the same cells are the renal site of production of extracellular matrix in pathological conditions, we hypothesize that this effect is a relevant one in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis/interstitial fibrosis during protracted therapies with CsA.	0

17064867	Modulation of overload-induced inflammation by aging and anabolic steroid administration. Aging can alter the skeletal muscle growth response induced by overload. The initiation of overload induces muscle extracellular matrix expansion, increased cellularity, and inflammatory gene expression, which are all related to processes important for myofiber growth. These remodeling processes are also biological targets of testosterone. It is not certain how aging affects the inflammatory response to functional overload and whether anabolic steroid administration can alter this response. The effect of anabolic steroid administration on inflammatory processes during functional overload is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine if age altered the skeletal muscle inflammatory response at the onset of functional overload and whether anabolic steroid administration would modulate this response in young or older animals. Five-month and 25 month F344 x BRN rats were given nandrolone decanoate (ND) (6 mg/kg bw/wk) or sham injections for 3 weeks, and then the soleus muscle was overloaded (OV) for 3 days by synergist ablation. ND alone induced a 230% increase in ED1(+) cells in 5 month muscle. Three days of OV had no effect on ED1(+) cell number at either age. OV combined with ND induced a 90% increase in ED2(+) cells in 5 month muscle, while there was no effect of either treatment alone at this age. In 25 month muscle, OV induced a 40% increase in ED2(+) cells. Regardless of age, OV induced muscle TNF-alpha mRNA expression (300%) and IL-6 mRNA expression (900%). ND attenuated OV-induced IL-6 mRNA but not TNF-alpha expression in both age groups. The overload induction of IL-1beta mRNA was 3-fold greater in 25 month muscle (1400%), compared to 5 month muscle (400%). ND administration ablated the overload IL-1beta mRNA induction in 25 month muscle. Anabolic steroid administration can suppress inflammatory cytokine gene expression at the onset of overload and this effect is age dependent.	0
21558656	Ion-exclusion/cation-exchange chromatography with dual detection of the conductivity and spectrophotometry for the simultaneous determination of common inorganic anionic species and cations in river and wastewater. Simultaneous determinations of common inorganic anionic species (SO(4)(2-), Cl(-), NO(3)(-), phosphate and silicate) and cations (Na(+), NH(4)(+), K(+), Mg(2+) and Ca(2+)) were conducted using an ion-chromatography system with dual detection of conductivity and spectrophotometry in tandem. The separation of ionic species on a weakly acidic cation-exchange resin was accomplished using a mixture of 100 mM ascorbic acid and 4 mM 18-crown-6 as an acidic eluent (pH 2.6), after which the ions were detected using a conductivity detector. Subsequently, phosphate and silicate were analyzed based on derivatization with molybdate and spectrophotometry at 700 nm. The detection limits at S/N = 3 ranged from 0.11 to 2.9   M for analyte ionic species. This method was applied to practical river water and wastewater with acceptable criteria for the anion-cation balance and comparisons of the measured and calculated electrical conductivity, demonstrating the usefulness of the present method for water quality monitoring.	0
17684064	The BRIGHT study: bifocal right ventricular resynchronization therapy: a randomized study. AIMS: The BRIGHT study evaluated bifocal right ventricular (RV) (apex and outflow tract) pacing in a single, blind, randomized crossover study in patients eligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Forty-two patients were enrolled with the following characteristics: chronic drug refractory heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV; ejection fraction (EF)<35%; QRS width >or= 120 ms; and a left bundle branch block. The aim of the study was to assess an improvement in left ventricular (LV) EF, 6 min walk test, Minnesota quality-of-life score, and NYHA classification. Methods and result Patients were randomized to receive either bifocal pacing or the control mode, each for a period of 3 months. Parameters were measured prior to randomization and after 3 months of control or bifocal pacing. Eight patients failed to make the 7 month follow-up, three patients died (one prior to randomization at the first month), five patients dropped out, and three patients refused further participation. One patient had a persistent lead problem, which was subsequently replaced with an LV lead, and one patient suffered with persistent atrial fibrillation. Compared with baseline, bifocal pacing improved EF from 26 +/- 12% to 36 +/- 11% (P < 0.0008), NYHA classification decreased from 2.8 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.7 (P < 0.007). Furthermore, the 6 min walk test improved from 372 +/- 129 m to 453 +/- 122 m (P < 0.05), and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure scores decreased from 33 +/- 20 to 24 +/- 21 (P < 0.006). In the control group, no significant changes in any parameters were observed. Eight patients did not tolerate reprogramming from DDD BRIGHT to control pacing, with symptoms disappearing in all patients after reprogramming to bifocal pacing. CONCLUSION: Bifocal RV pacing in patients with a classic indication for CRT shows improvement in all parameters.	0
23998140	Psychologic outcomes in implant prosthodontics. Consensus regarding outcomes of the treatment of tooth loss, especially the psychologic outcomes, is needed to guide discovery of best practices and enable a better understanding of patient management for this chronic condition. This paper presents the findings of the ORONet Psychological Working Group for prosthodontics and aims to identify psychologic outcomes with properties deemed critical to meet clinical trial and clinical practice needs for the future. References obtained using a PubMed/Medline search were reviewed for clinical outcomes measures of interest. Clinical outcomes measures were judged relative to the criteria of truth, discrimination, and feasibility. Of the psychologic outcome measures identified in this systematic review, only the OHIP-14 was thought to be suitable for use in general practice and multi-institutional outcome registries and clinical trials. Development of clinically useful psychologic outcomes for future use could benefit from developmental methods and tools outlined in the patient-related outcomes field of clinical care.	0
8554005	Role of echocardiography in perioperative management of patients undergoing open heart surgery. TEE has assumed a pivotal role in the perioperative management of patients undergoing open-heart surgery. The information obtained influences important therapeutic decisions in thoracic aortic surgery, valvular surgery, and coronary artery bypass surgery. TEE also assists in determining the reason for failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass and allows rapid detection of the etiology of hypotension in the patient after surgery. Advances in technology have resulted in three-dimensional images of cardiac structures, and this will further enhance the usefulness of echocardiography for the surgeon. TEE should no longer be regarded as an imaging tool available only in academic centers, but should be routinely used by qualified operators in centers performing open-heart surgery.	0
20010351	Patients with low rectal cancer treated by abdominoperineal excision have worse tumors and higher involved margin rates compared with patients treated by anterior resection. PURPOSE: Patients with low rectal cancer have worse outcomes compared to those with upper rectal cancer. Reports suggest that low anterior resection may be oncologically superior to abdominoperineal excision, although no good evidence exists to support this. We looked at a recent series of patients with low rectal cancer to explore some of the issues. METHODS: We analyzed 153 patients from the MERCURY study with low rectal cancer (<or=6 cm from the anal verge). The median tumor height, percentage undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, involved margin rates, and degree of local invasion were compared for abdominoperineal excision vs low anterior resection. RESULTS: The mean tumor height from the anal verge was 2.9 cm for the patients with abdominoperineal excision vs 4.6 cm in the patients with low anterior resection. The involved margin rate was 20% overall, but was 31.9% for abdominoperineal excision vs 12% for low anterior resection. More patients who had abdominoperineal excision had neoadjuvant therapy (64% vs 41%) and a higher proportion had more locally advanced (T4) tumors. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing abdominoperineal excision have higher involved margin rates; however, they had lower and more locally extensive tumors despite a greater proportion undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Patients with low rectal cancer pose difficulties with regard to optimal management. Targeted strategies are needed to improve outcome in this complex and common cancer.	0
9356886	Beyond body image: the integration of feminist and transcultural theories in the understanding of self starvation. OBJECTIVE: The present study represents an intersection between cross-cultural theorizing and teminist scholarship. It is an attempt to provoke as well as augment prevailing biomedical models that esteem fear of fatness as the primary motivation for voluntary starvation in anorexic women. METHOD: Recent studies of eating disturbance in both Eastern and Western societies are invoked to demonstrate the ways in which women straddling two worlds, be it generational, work-family, cultural or traditional and modern, may employ food denial as an instrumental means of negotiating the transition, disconnection, and oppression that they uniformly endure. RESULTS: A feminist/transcultural interpretation of the literature suggests that by construing anorexia nervosa as a body image disorder or Western culture-bound syndrome, extant models miss the broader contexts and varied meanings of food refusal. DISCUSSION: The implications of cross-disciplinary perspectives for theory building and treatment are discussed, acknowledging not only the gendered nature of eating disorders but their embodiment of power differentials as well.	0
9701137	Primary care providers' responsiveness to health-risk behaviors reported by adolescent patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess clinicians' responsiveness to health-risk behaviors reported by adolescent patients during a comprehensive clinical preventive services visit. DESIGN: Nonprobability sample of adolescent patients scheduled for a routine physical examination. SETTING: Seven clinical sites in the Chicago, Ill, area. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen primary care providers and 95 adolescent patients between 11 and 18 years of age. INTERVENTION: Providers delivered comprehensive clinical preventive services to adolescent patients using the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services model. This model includes screening, guidance, a physical examination, and immunizations. Prior to the visit, adolescent patients completed a screening questionnaire that included a 52-item health-risk behavior profile. Responses on the screening questionnaire were discussed during the visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Each provider's responsiveness to reported health-risk behaviors was determined by comparing the adolescent patient's responses on the screening questionnaire with those reported during a debriefing interview with the adolescent about whether specific subjects were discussed. Responsiveness to highly sensitive behaviors was determined by comparing the screening questionnaire and the medical record. RESULTS: On average, each adolescent patient reported 10 risk behaviors, of which 7 were discussed. The severity of the reported risk behavior, the number of reported biological health concerns, and the adolescent patient's sex were significant predictors of the provider's responsiveness. The number of reported health-risk behaviors, visit duration, provider's professional role and sex, whether the adolescent was a new patient, and the adolescent patient's age were unrelated to responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Providers addressed most health-risk behaviors reported during a single visit, but responsiveness declined when 3 or more biological health concerns or relatively severe problems were reported. Steps can be taken to increase providers' responsiveness.	0

15601870	NF-Y is essential for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and inducible transcription of several CCAAT box-containing genes. Osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF)/receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand is essential for inducing the differentiation of mature osteoclasts. We find that nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) binds to the CCAAT box on the ODF promoter and regulates its basal transcriptional activity. The CCAAT box on the ODF gene is required for its transcriptional induction by vitamin D3, suggesting that NF-Y coregulates this promoter along with VDR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that NF-Y is required for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and TATA box binding protein on the ODF promoter. Stimulation with vitamin D3 facilitates the recruitment of VDR and p300 onto the ODF promoter, resulting in acetylation of histone H4 in an NF-Y-independent manner. ODF gene induction by parathyroid hormone or prostaglandin E is also dependent on NF-Y. Furthermore, NF-Y is essential for the recruitment of RNAPII onto other CCAAT box-containing promoters, such as those of osteopontin, CYP24, and E2F1. These results suggest that NF-Y recruits RNAPII and general transcription factors onto various CCAAT box-containing promoters in response to various inductions to permit strong transcriptional activation independently of histone modifications.	1
17236274	Modes of information delivery in radiologic anatomy education: Impact on student performance. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study provides a systematic assessment of different methods of delivering radiologic teaching content (lecture, printed text, and digital content delivery) under standard conditions, enabling comparison of the effectiveness of these methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A printed atlas of sectional anatomy was used as a standard. Digital content was developed on the basis of the printed atlas. Lecturers used both the printed and the digital content to prepare lectures. Standardized teaching material thus created was presented to second-term undergraduate students who had attended the school's anatomy course, but had not received any radiology teaching. Multiple choice examinations were used to assess the students' ability to recognize anatomical structures in known as well as unknown images. In a survey, the students' subjective experience of the learning process was assessed. RESULTS: No difference was seen between the groups regarding examination results. Students preferred a combination of digital media and lectures by enthusiastic teachers. CONCLUSIONS: The shortage of teachers requires a compromise concerning the delivery of radiologic anatomy content in a medical school setting. Based on our results, we recommend a combined approach of lecture and digital content delivery.	0

16919442	Histone demethylation and androgen-dependent transcription. Covalent modifications of histones play important roles in the regulation of chromatin dynamics and gene activity. Until recently, it was believed that methyl groups could not be removed from histones; as such, the discovery of the first demethylases opens a novel era in understanding how chromatin dynamic is regulated and shows that active demethylation is linked to both transcriptional repression and activation. During androgen-dependent gene activation, specific demethylases are involved in the control of gene expression. These new findings represent a milestone in elucidating the function of demethylases in gene expression. Furthermore, they show that active demethylation of repressive histone marks is a hallmark in the control of specific gene expression.	0

This report describes our operative experience with 68 patients from 1974 to 1982. According to a prospective interdisciplinary program, lesions in 351 patients were staged by emergency esophagoscopic findings: Stage I, ulceration; Stage II, hemorrhage and ulceration; Stage III, mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage, and ulceration. Total parenteral nutrition or jejunal feeding was given to patients with Stage II lesions for 3 weeks and to those with Stage III lesions for 3 months before repeat esophagoscopy. Operations were required by 68 patients who had Stage III lesions and severe stenosis. Procedures done included 39 retrosternal colon interpositions, 11 partial or total gastrectomies, nine esophagogastrectomies, four esophagoenteral colonic bypasses, six esophagogastric colonic interpositions following partial gastric resection, and one gastrojejunostomy. Eleven of the cervical anastomoses were to the pharynx. There were no operative deaths and no anastomotic leaks. All patients have satisfactory nutrition and rehabilitation. Our operative experience in the preceding 5 years included an 11% mortality; improved results in the past 8 years are attributed to early and accurate staging, planned multidisciplinary management, good nutritional support, and better timing of operations. Stage III esophagogastric corrosive lesions may be treated within 4 to 5 months of injury with low mortality and good functional outcome.	0
18773627	An evaluation of FIGO 2000: the first 5 years. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2000 Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) staging and classification system and to identify any factors predictive of failure of first-line chemotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: Patients registered at 1 center between January 2000 and December 2004 (n = 2,209) were identified from a dedicated database. Data were collected on all patients who received treatment for GTN at the center (n = 132). Survival analysis (Kaplan Meier method) and chi2 tests were performed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two eligible patients were identified. Of those, 38 of 107 (35.5%) of patients who scored as low risk and 2 of 15 (13.3%) of patients who scored as high risk required salvage chemotherapy. Three of 107 (2.8%) of low-risk patients and 3 of 15 (20%) of high-risk patients had salvage surgery. No statistically significant predictive factors for treatment failure were identified. There was a trend toward association with increased age at diagnosis: 48.8% of patients aged > or = 30 required second-line therapy compared to 33.3% aged < 30 (p = 0.098). CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of women treated on the low-risk regimen will require salvage chemotherapy, but this does not affect their survival. Women aged > or = 30 may be at particular risk of treatment failure so could be offered high-risk chemotherapy from the outset.	0
22451395	The use of mammalian cultured cells loaded with a fluorescent dye shows specific membrane penetration of undissociated acetic acid. Acetic acid induces unique physiological responses in mammalian cells. Our previous study found that fura-2-loaded human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells showed a robust intracellular fluorescence response immediately after stimulation with acetic acid, and no such response in the case of citric acid. In the present study, we aimed to identify the unique characteristics of acetic acid responsible for this phenomenon. We found that one such feature is its hydrophobicity. We also discovered that acetic acid induces cell responses by intracellular acidification. Of the components of acetic acid in solution (protons, acetate ions, and undissociated acetic acid), undissociated acetic acid might be the functional unit that penetrates the lipid bilayer of cell membranes to acidify the intracellular environment, thereby inducing cell responses. The method used in this study might be convenient in evaluating the intracellular acidification of cultured cells by acids in the external environment.	0

8512601	Lipid and lipoprotein distributions in children by ethnic group, gender, and geographic location--preliminary findings of the Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH). BACKGROUND: The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health is a school-based study designed to test the effectiveness of dietary, physical activity, and educational interventions for reducing cardiovascular disease risk and teaching healthful behaviors to children. METHODS: As part of a pilot phase in 1989, lipid, lipoprotein, and anthropometric measures were taken in black (n = 90), Hispanic (n = 68), and white (n = 265) 8- to 10-year-old schoolchildren in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in mean lipoprotein cholesterol values between fasting and nonfasting children. Therefore data from fasting and nonfasting children were pooled. Males and females within the same ethnic groups had similar mean levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were higher among white and black males than among females from the same ethnic groups. Black males had higher total cholesterol than white males and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than white males and Hispanic males. Similarly, black females had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than white and Hispanic females. In all children combined high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely correlated and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was positively correlated with subscapular and tricep skinfold thickness, weight, and body mass index. There were significant differences in mean lipoprotein cholesterol levels between geographic sites. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were highest in children from California followed by children from Texas, Minnesota, and Louisiana. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that body fatness total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol differ in children by gender, ethnicity, and geographic location.	0

23322682	Framing patient consent for student involvement in pelvic examination: a dual model of autonomy. Patient consent has been formulated in terms of radical individualism rather than shared benefits. Medical education relies on the provision of patient consent to provide medical students with the training and experience to become competent doctors. Pelvic examination represents an extreme case in which patients may legitimately seek to avoid contact with inexperienced medical students particularly where these are male. However, using this extreme case, this paper will examine practices of framing and obtaining consent as perceived by medical students. This paper reports findings of an exploratory qualitative study of medical students and junior doctors. Participants described a number of barriers to obtaining informed consent. These related to misunderstandings concerning student roles and experiences and insufficient information on the nature of the examination. Participants reported perceptions of the negative framing of decisions on consent by nursing staff where the student was male. Potentially coercive practices of framing of the decision by senior doctors were also reported. Participants outlined strategies they adopted to circumvent patients' reasons for refusal. Practices of framing the information used by students, nurses and senior doctors to enable patients to decide about consent are discussed in the context of good ethical practice. In the absence of a clear ethical model, coercion appears likely. We argue for an expanded model of autonomy in which the potential tension between respecting patients' autonomy and ensuring the societal benefit of well-trained doctors is recognised. Practical recommendations are made concerning information provision and clear delineations of student and patient roles and expectations.	0
17895140	Moyamoya syndrome associated with Sneddon's syndrome and antiphospholipid-protein antibodies. BACKGROUND: There are anecdotal reports of the rare combination of Sneddon's syndrome, lupus anticoagulant, and Moyamoya. To our knowledge, we now report the first case of anticardiolipin antibodies, Sneddon's syndrome, and Moyamoya. METHODS: Case-report and systematic literature review. RESULTS: A 37-year-old woman had 31/2 years of recurrent left-sided sensory-motor symptoms. More recently, she had experienced vertigo, diplopia, and imbalance. Medical history included headaches, labile hypertension, left arm venous thrombosis requiring anticoagulation, and cigarette smoking. On examination she had livedo reticularis, limited left eye abduction, and left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed right frontal, left parieto-occipital and pontine high intensity lesions on T(2)-weighted images consistent with ischemia and abnormally increased flow-void in the basal ganglionic regions. Conventional cerebral angiography showed a Moyamoya pattern. Transesophageal echocardiography and electroencephalogram were normal. Serologic studies were remarkable for anticardiolipin antibodies immunoglobulin G isotype only. She responded favorably to carbamazepine as treatment of presumptive focal seizures, and long-term anticoagulation. Seven other cases reported in the literature were found and reviewed, with different combinations of Moyamoya, Sneddon's syndrome, and antiphospholipid-protein antibodies. The mean age was 37 (range 18-59, SD+/-16) years, male/female ratio 3/5; clinical features included cognitive changes (4 pts), ischemic stroke (6pts), seizures (1pt), and intracranial hemorrhage (2pts). Anticoagulation/steroids/anti-platelet agents were empirically associated with a favorable survival and functional outcome in 6 cases. CONCLUSION: This case expands the spectrum of associations with Moyamoya, and in conjunction with a review of the literature, suggests that evaluation for antiphospholipid-protein antibodies is recommended in cases of Moyamoya syndrome.	0

17689919	Bisphenol-A and chlorinated derivatives in adipose tissue of women. Bisphenol-A (BPA) and chlorinated derivatives (Cl(x)BPA) were investigated in adipose tissue of women in Southeast Spain. BPA was above limit of detection (LOD) in 11 out of 20 samples (55%). Among Cl(x)BPA, Cl(2)BPA was the most frequent (80%) and abundant, constituting 94.6% of total chlorinated BPA in adipose tissue. Mean +/- S.D. of BPA, monochloro-BPA (ClBPA), dichloro-BPA (Cl(2)BPA), and trichloro-BPA (Cl(3)BPA) were 5.83 +/- 3.48, 3.05 +/- 0.28, 9.21 +/- 9.26, and 0.74 +/- 0.15 ng/g of adipose tissue, respectively. No tetrachloro-BPA (Cl(4)BPA) was found above LOD. There are no published data on BPA in human adipose tissue or on Cl(x)BPA in adipose tissue or blood, limiting comparisons. BPA levels were similar (w/w) to findings in blood (w/v) in other populations and below levels reported in placenta tissue (w/w). Because of the estrogen mimicking effects of BPA and its Cl(x)BPA, further research is needed to explore their combined effects on human health and trends in human exposure.	0
22883438	The role of the Janus kinase family/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway in fibrotic renal disease. Over the past several years, a number of cytokines and growth factors including transforming growth factor b1, tumor necrosis factor a, and angiotensin II have been shown to play a crucial role in renal fibrosis. The Janus kinase family (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) constitute one of the primary signaling pathways that regulate cytokine expression, and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway has increasingly been implicated in the pathophysiology of renal disease. This review examines the role of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in fibrotic renal disease. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is activated in a variety of renal diseases and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of renal fibrosis. Experimental evidence suggests that inhibition of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, in particular JAK2 and STAT3, may suppress renal fibrosis and protect renal function. However, it is incompletely understood which cells activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and which JAK/STAT signaling pathway is activated in each renal disease. Research regarding JAK/STAT signaling and its contribution to renal disease is still ongoing in humans. Future studies are required to elucidate the potential role of JAK/STAT signaling inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in the attenuation of renal fibrosis.	0

20714221	Parole terms for a killer: directing caspase3/CAD induced DNA strand breaks to coordinate changes in gene expression. In a series of discoveries over the preceding decade, a number of laboratories have unequivocally established that apoptotic proteins and pathways are well conserved cell fate determinants, which act independent of a cell death response. Within this context, the role for apoptotic proteins in the induction of cell differentiation has been widely documented. Despite these discoveries, little information has been forthcoming regarding a conserved mechanism by which apoptotic proteins achieve this non-death outcome. In the following discussion, we will explore the premise that the penultimate step in apoptosis, genome wide DNA damage/strand breaks act as a conserved genomic reprogramming event necessary for cell differentiation (Larsen et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2010; 107:4230-5). Moreover, we hypothesis that directed DNA damage, as mediated by known apoptotic proteins, may participate in numerous forms of regulated gene expression.	0
14289379	THE EFFECT OF ADAPTATION OF THE TASTE THRESHOLD OBSERVED WITH A SEMIAUTOMATIC GUSTOMETER. A special \"gustometer\" has been built, which permits continuous measurement of the threshold of taste sensations. Taste sensations show strong adaptation even at the threshold level. The adaptation was much the same for the four primary tastes, but there were large individual differences. Of theoretical interest is the finding that adaptation to a taste can occur even with subliminal stimuli.	0
9380288	[Analysis of quality of life. Development of an evaluation instrument]. OBJECTIVE: To develop a questionnaire about quality of life (QV) suitable for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. DESIGN: Two prospective studies by direct interviews; in the first one the questionnaire was answered before and after surgical intervention and in the second during ICU stay and six months after hospital discharge. SETTING: Surgical ward and surgical-medical ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult, co-operative patients, resident near the hospital, who gave informed consent have been interviewed. The following items of QOL were investigated: residence, physical activity, social life, perceived QV, oral communication and functional limitation, considering age. The last two items were assessed by the interviewer. RESULTS: Inter-observer reliability on oral communication and functional limitation, assessed by two interviewers in 87 surgical patients, was good (p = 0.68 and p = 0.72 respectively). Validation of the questionnaire in 37 surgical cases showed worsening in all the items, consistent with theoretical prediction. In the 152 ICU consecutively admitted eligible patients, physical activity, social life, functional limitation and global QV (sum of all the investigated items) significantly changed. Residence, perceived QV and oral communication did not change. Internal consistency of the instrument was good (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The evaluative instrument studied shows good reliability and validity. The authors suggest a shorter questionnaire could be tested in future investigations.	0
23301080	Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway impairs G2/M transition of cell cycle in late developing progenitors of the avian embryo retina. PI3K/Akt is an important pathway implicated in the proliferation and survival of cells in the CNS. Here we investigated the participation of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway in cell cycle of developing retinal progenitors. Immunofluorescence assays performed in cultures of chick embryo retinal cells and intact tissues revealed the presence of phosphorylated Akt and 4E-BP1 in cells with typical mitotic profiles. Blockade of PI3K activity with the chemical inhibitor LY 294002 (LY) in retinal explants blocked the progression of proliferating cells through G2/M transition, indicated by an expressive increase in the number of cells labeled for phosphorylated histone H3 in the ventricular margin of the retina. No significant level of cell death could be detected at this region. Retinal explants treated with LY for 24 h also showed a significant decrease in the expression of phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK-3 and the hyperphosphorylated form of 4E-BP1. Although no change in the expression of cyclin B1 was detected, a significant decrease in CDK1 expression was noticed after 24 h of LY treatment both in retinal explants and monolayer cultures. Our results suggest that PI3K/Akt is an active pathway during proliferation of retinal progenitors and its activity appears to be required for proper CDK1 expression levels and mitosis progression of these cells.	0
23331683	Epidermal structure created by canine hair follicle keratinocytes enriched with bulge cells in a three-dimensional skin equivalent model in vitro: implications for regenerative therapy of canine epidermis. BACKGROUND: Keratinocytes in the hair follicle bulge region have a high proliferative capacity, with characteristics of epithelial stem cells. This cell population might thus be an ideal source for generating the interfollicular epidermis in a canine skin equivalent. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine the ability of canine hair follicle bulge cell-enriched keratinocytes to construct canine living skin equivalents with interfollicular epidermis in vitro. ANIMALS: Four healthy beagle dogs from a research colony. METHODS: Bulge cell-enriched keratinocytes showing keratin 15 immunoreactivity were isolated from canine hair follicles and cultured on dermal equivalent containing canine fibroblasts. Skin equivalents were subjected to histological, immunohistochemical, western blot and RT-PCR analyses after 10-14 days of culture at the air-liquid interface. RESULTS: The keratinocyte sheets showed an interfollicular epidermal structure comprising four to five living cell layers covered with a horny layer. Immunoreactivities for keratin 14 and desmoglein 3 were detected in the basal and immediate suprabasilar layers of the epidermis, while keratin 10 and desmoglein 1 occurred in more superficial layers. Claudin 1 immunoreactivity was seen in the suprabasalar layer of the constructed epidermis, and filaggrin monomers and loricrin were detected in the uppermost layer. Basal keratinocytes in the skin equivalent demonstrated immunoreactivity to antibodies against basement membrane zone molecules. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A bulge stem cell-enriched population from canine hair follicles formed interfollicular epidermis within 2 weeks in vitro, and thus represents a promising model for regenerative therapy of canine skin.	0

20123762	Quantifying variation of paediatric length of stay among intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand. OBJECTIVE: To quantify variation of mean paediatric length of stay (LoS) among intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand. METHOD: Retrospective data from Australian and New Zealand institutions that admitted children to ICU were analysed. The data were collected between 1997 and 2006, providing a total of 123 institution years of data (an average of 6.15 years per site). Using 47,068 admissions, LoS was modelled as the outcome variable of a    regression with a child's risk factors entered as fixed effects (allowing adjustment for case mix) and variation among ICUs modelled using a random effect. RESULTS: Six Australasian ICUs had an average risk-adjusted LoS for children, which was significantly shorter than average, whereas five had an average LoS that was significantly longer than average. The remaining nine sites had average LoS that were not significantly different from the average (at the 95% level). Among other risk factors, previous admission to an ICU and respiratory support within the first hour of admission were both associated with prolonged LoS. CONCLUSION: There was significant variation in paediatric LoS at the ICU level not accounted for by patient case-mix. This has important implications for efficiency of ICU processes and, possibly, other components of quality of patient care in those institutions with longer LoS.	0

17688119	Motivational analysis of academic help-seeking: self-determination in adolescents' friendship. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role that friendship motivation plays in academic help-seeking based on self-determination theory. The relations among self-determined friendship motivation, academic help-seeking, and feeling of satisfaction were examined among high school students (N= 670) in Japan. Analyses showed that self-determined friendship motivation was associated with the academic help-seeking, which in turn was related to the feeling of satisfaction with academic learning and friendship. The role of friendship motivation in the academic setting is discussed.	0

18341584	Widespread distribution of a unique marine protistan lineage. Unicellular eukaryotes (protists) are key components of marine food webs, yet knowledge of their diversity, distributions and respective ecologies is limited. We investigated uncultured protists using 18S rRNA gene sequencing, phylogenetic analyses, specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes and other methods. Because few studies have been conducted in warm water systems, we focused on two Atlantic subtropical regions, the Sargasso Sea and the Florida Current. Cold temperate waters were also sampled. Gene sequences comprising a unique eukaryotic lineage, herein termed 'biliphytes', were identified in most samples, whether from high- (30 degrees C) or from low- (5 degrees C) temperature waters. Sequences within this uncultured group have previously been retrieved from high latitudes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest biliphytes are a sister group to the cryptophytes and katablepharids, although the relationship is not statistically supported. Bootstrap-supported subclades were delineated but coherence was not obvious with respect to geography or physicochemical parameters. Unlike results from the initial publication on these organisms (therein 'picobiliphytes'), we could not detect a nucleomorph, either visually, or by targeted primers. Phycobilin-like fluorescence associated with biliphyte-specific FISH-probed cells supports the hypothesis that they are photosynthetic. Our data indicate the biliphytes are nanoplanktonic in size, averaging 4.1 +/- 1.0 x 3.5 +/- 0.8 microm (+/-SD) for one probed group, and 3.5 +/- 0.9 x 3.0 +/- 0.9 microm (+/-SD) for another. We estimate biliphytes contributed 28 (+/-6)% of the phytoplanktonic biomass in tropical eddy-influenced surface waters. Given their broad thermal and geographic distribution, understanding the role these protists play in biogeochemical cycling within different habitats is essential.	0
16978848	In vitro study of lysozyme in poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres with sucrose acetate isobutyrate. This study investigated the suitability of microsphere formulations for extended protein delivery and complete protein release. These microspheres were prepared by a multi-emulsion method and prepared using a mixture of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), RG 502H (lactide:glycolide=50:50, M(W) 9300) and sucrose acetate isobutyrate (SAIB). SAIB embedded into the microspheres and mixed with PLGA, improved the efficiency of enzyme encapsulation. The in vitro release rate of lysozyme (Lys) from the microspheres was reduced due to the high viscosity of the added SAIB and less degradation of PLGA by SAIB. These properties enabled prolonged release of Lys for up to 2 months, characterized by a minimal initial burst of Lys and nearly zero-order protein release kinetics result from co-administration of sorbitan monooleate 80. When it is considered that degradation products of SAIB are inactive for labile proteins, SAIB may be regarded as a promising candidate for long-acting protein delivery.	0
15071991	[Dynamics in the local and systemic immune factors in patients with cystic transformation of the bile duct]. Cystic transformation of biliary ducts (CTBD) is a rare inborn anomaly of the biliary system development. For the patients with CTBD quite high metabolic activity of neutrophils according to data of spontaneous test with nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT-test), reduction of IgA content in the initial period, significant raising of interleukin-6 (IL-6) level on the first postoperative day are characteristic. Quantity of active neutrophils of type II in the blood of patients with CTBD depends on antigenic load. Neutrophils in the bile restore the NBT according to type I. Local concentration of IL-6 and IL-8, and also the functional activity of neutrophils in ductal bile in patients with CTBD are the sensitive indexes of clinical state and immunological reactivity.	0

11248875	Urinary 5-L-oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid) excretion is greater in infants in Jamaica than in infants in England. OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of excretion in urine of 5-L-oxoproline, as a measure of glycine status, during the first six weeks of life in Jamaican infants. DESIGN: Spot samples of urine were collected from term and preterm infants at birth and longitudinally to four weeks of age, or at six weeks of age. 5-L-oxoproline was isolated by column chromatography and hydrolysed to L-glutamic acid, which was measured enzymatically and the results expressed relative to creatinine excretion. SETTING: Maternity wards and postnatal clinic of the University Hospital of the West Indies. SUBJECTS: African-Caribbean infants, 19 term and 21 preterm, from birth to four weeks of age, and 79 term infants at six weeks of age. RESULTS: There were no differences between term and preterm infants. Excretion of 5-L-oxoproline increased progressively from birth, 141 mumol/mmol creatinine, to 270 mumol/mmol creatinine at four weeks of age. At six weeks of age, excretion was significantly greater than at birth or four weeks of age, 525 mumol/mmol creatinine. Compared with infants born in England, the excretion of 5-L-oxoproline was not different at birth, but was significantly greater in Jamaican infants at six weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: Glycine status, indicated by increased excretion of 5-L-oxoproline, is marginal in Jamaican infants at six weeks of age, and this possibly reflects a limitation in the endogenous biosynthesis of glycine due to a dietary limitation of folate or vitamin B-12.	0

21180468	Assessment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder in relation to reversibility, IgE, eosinophil, and neutrophil count in a University Teaching Hospital in South Delhi, India. OBJECTIVES: The physiological and clinical similarities between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) make their differentiation difficult. In the present study, we compared reversibility to bronchodilator, immunoglobulin E (IgE), blood eosinophil and neutrophil levels among asthma and COPD patients to differentiate these diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried on 20 asthmatics and 29 patients of COPD that reported to the outpatient and inpatient department in University Teaching Hospital, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India. The parameters evaluated included pulmonary function (FEV(1), FVC, and FEV(1)/FVC), IgE levels, and eosinophil and neutrophil count. RESULTS: It was observed that reversibility was significantly higher in asthmatic patients, while irreversibility predominates in COPD patients. There was no significant difference in pre- and post-FEV(1) and pre- and post-FVC and in their percentage predicted. However the percentage change in FEV(1) significantly varies in asthma and COPD patients. No significant changes in neutrophil and eosinophil levels were observed in these patients. The serum IgE levels were found significantly higher in asthmatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that reversibility in FEV(1) levels or percentage change in FEV(1) and serum IgE levels are promising lab parameter to distinguish these two conditions. However, further research is required to fully understand the role of neutrophil and eosinophil in the onset and development of asthma and COPD.	0

12028353	Partial regeneration and long-term survival of rat retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve crush is accompanied by altered expression, phosphorylation and distribution of cytoskeletal proteins. In a screen to identify genes that are expressed differentially in the retina after partial optic nerve crush, we identified MAP1B as an up-regulated transcript. Western blot analysis of inner retina protein preparations confirmed changes in the protein composition of the microtubule-associated cytoskeleton of crushed vs. uncrushed nerve. MAP1B immunoreactivity and transcript levels were elevated for two weeks after crush. Immunostaining and Western blots with monoclonal antibodies directed against developmentally regulated phosphorylation sites on MAP1B revealed a gradient of MAP1B phosphorylation from the proximal optic nerve stump to the soma of retinal ganglion cells. Most interestingly, using antibodies directed against developmentally regulated phosphorylation sites on MAP1B, we observed that a significant number of crushed optic nerve axons develop MAP1B-immunopositive growth cones, which cross the crush site and migrate along the distal nerve fragment. In parallel, an abnormal distribution of highly phosphorylated neurofilament protein (pNF-H) in the cell soma and dendrites of presumably axotomized retinal ganglion cells was observed following partial nerve crush. This redistribution is present for the period between day 7 and 28 postcrush and is not seen in cells that stay connected to the superior colliculus. Axotomized ganglion cells, which contain pNF-H in soma and dendrites appear to have been disconnected from the colliculus at an early stage but survive axonal trauma for long periods.	0
20572475	The role of emotional numbing in sexual functioning among veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) negatively impacts sexuality, yet few studies have evaluated which component of PTSD contributes to this known association. The present study examined which of four PTSD clusters (numbing, avoidance, intrusiveness, and hyperarousal) was most closely linked to sexual problems in a sample of 197 veterans from the Iraq or Afghanistan wars. Newly registered veterans completed a packet of questionnaires including standardized measures of PTSD and questions regarding sexual functioning. A stepwise logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between symptom cluster and sexual functioning. As predicted, only the numbing cluster was retained in the regression model. The numbing cluster appears to be intimately tied to sexual functioning, assessment of which should be part of a comprehensive evaluation during the postdeployment readjustment phase. Those exhibiting numbing symptoms should be thoroughly assessed for sexual functioning problems and referred for treatment as necessary.	0

In addition to the typical clinical features of the disorder, she had bilateral hip involvement, which was improved by cementless total hip prosthesis.	0
8073357	Bleeding from gastric ulcer halted by laparoscopic suture ligation. In a 48-year-old Japanese man there was an uncontrollable and recurrent bleeding from a gastric ulcer and laparoscopic surgery was done. Two cannulae were placed in the gastric cavity through the abdominal wall and suture ligation of the bleeding vessel at the posterior wall of the stomach was done under video-visual control with endoscopic guidance. The bleeding ceased, complications were nil, and he remains well. This article reports on surgery done to repair uncontrollable, recurrent bleeding from a gastric ulcer. Two cannulae were placed in the gastric cavity through the abdominal wall and suture of the vessel at the posterior wall of the stomach was done with videovisual control and endoscopic guidance. This approach is concluded to have supplied minimal-access surgery, cost effectiveness, early discharge, less pain, and doctor-patient satisfaction.	0
23968401	Functional Val66Met polymorphism of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor in type 2 diabetes with depression in Han Chinese subjects. BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of major depression. Individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have a high prevalence of major depression and low levels of BDNF. We therefore explored whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with co-morbid depression and whether depression affects the serum levels of BDNF in a Han Chinese subjects with T2DM. METHODS: A Total of 296 T2DM patients and 70 healthy volunteers (Health control, HC group) were recruited in this study. T2DM patients were divided into two subgroups: depressive diabetes group (DDM group, n   =   64) and non-depressive diabetes group (NDDM group, n   =   232), according to the presence or the absence of depression assessed by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Val66Met polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (PCR-RFLP). Serum BDNF levels were measured by ELISA kit. RESULTS: In this study, 21.6% (64/296) patients with T2DM had depression. The BDNF Val66Met genotype distributions were statistically different among the three groups (  2   =   7.39, p   <   0.05). DDM group carried the highest frequencies of Met allele (53.9%) compared to HC group (39.3%) and NDDM group (38.8%). Subjects with Met/Met had lowest serum BDNF levels (76.59        5.12  pg/ml, F   =   7.39, p   <   0.05) compared to subjects with Val/Met (79.04        5.19  pg/ml) and Val/Val (83.83        3.97  pg/ml). Within T2DM group, it was also observed that the serum BDNF levels in DDM group were significantly lower than those in NDDM group (76.67        5.35 vs. 79.84        3.97  pg/ml, p   <   0.05). In type 2 diabetes subjects, BDNF serum levels were significant correlations with genotypes (r   =   -0.346, p   <   0.01), depression scores (r   =   -0.486, p   <   0.01) and HbA1c (r   =   -0.168, p   <   0.05). After adjustment for gender, HbA1c, BMI and numbers of complications, BDNF Val/Met genotype distributions (OR   =   2.105, p   <   0.05) and decreased serum BDNF levels (OR   =   0.835, p   <   0.01) were independently associated with depression in T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism might be implicated in the pathogenesis of depression in T2DM by decreasing serum BDNF levels in Han Chinese Subjects.	0
21626913	Demons deformable registration of CT and cone-beam CT using an iterative intensity matching approach. PURPOSE: A method of intensity-based deformable registration of CT and cone-beam CT (CBCT) images is described, in which intensity correction occurs simultaneously within the iterative registration process. The method preserves the speed and simplicity of the popular Demons algorithm while providing robustness and accuracy in the presence of large mismatch between CT and CBCT voxel values (\"intensity\"). METHODS: A variant of the Demons algorithm was developed in which an estimate of the relationship between CT and CBCT intensity values for specific materials in the image is computed at each iteration based on the set of currently overlapping voxels. This tissue-specific intensity correction is then used to estimate the registration output for that iteration and the process is repeated. The robustness of the method was tested in CBCT images of a cadaveric head exhibiting a broad range of simulated intensity variations associated with x-ray scatter, object truncation, and/or errors in the reconstruction algorithm. The accuracy of CT-CBCT registration was also measured in six real cases, exhibiting deformations ranging from simple to complex during surgery or radiotherapy guided by a CBCT-capable C-arm or linear accelerator, respectively. RESULTS: The iterative intensity matching approach was robust against all levels of intensity variation examined, including spatially varying errors in voxel value of a factor of 2 or more, as can be encountered in cases of high x-ray scatter. Registration accuracy without intensity matching degraded severely with increasing magnitude of intensity error and introduced image distortion. A single histogram match performed prior to registration alleviated some of these effects but was also prone to image distortion and was quantifiably less robust and accurate than the iterative approach. Within the six case registration accuracy study, iterative intensity matching Demons reduced mean TRE to (2.5 +/- 2.8) mm compared to (3.5 +/- 3.0) mm with rigid registration. CONCLUSIONS: A method was developed to iteratively correct CT-CBCT intensity disparity during Demons registration, enabling fast, intensity-based registration in CBCT-guided procedures such as surgery and radiotherapy, in which CBCT voxel values may be inaccurate. Accurate CT-CBCT registration in turn facilitates registration of multimodality preoperative image and planning data to intraoperative CBCT by way of the preoperative CT, thereby linking the intraoperative frame of reference to a wealth of preoperative information that could improve interventional guidance.	0

16175968	A review of the parasitic dinoflagellates Hematodinium species and Hematodinium-like infections in marine crustaceans. Parasitic dinoflagellates in the genus Hematodinium are important parasites of marine Crustacea. Outbreaks of these parasites have damaged commercial stocks of Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, snow crab Chionoecetes opilio, Tanner crab C. bairdi, American blue crab Callinectes sapidus, and velvet swimming crab Necora puber. Species of Hematodinium can reach high enough levels to regulate their host populations, but mortalities are also centred on the unfished juveniles and females, hosts not normally sampled by fisheries; hence impacts are often underreported. Seasonal prevalences of up to 85 % occur annually in many host populations; in effect, these parasites form cryptic blooms in the water column with crabs and other crustaceans at risk of disease. We review the biology and ecology of Hematodinium spp. infections in crustaceans. Included is a comparison of the different infections, a synthesis of what is known, and an attempt to highlight fruitful areas for continued research.	0

23968947	Spontaneous blink rates in children during different types of eye movements. INTRODUCTION: The spontaneous blink rate (SBR) is variable in humans. It increases rapidly during childhood before reaching a plateau in adulthood at 10-20 blinks/minute. Our aim was to compare the SBR during different visual tasks in children. METHODS: Thirty-nine healthy participants (mean age(SD):13.6(3.5)years, M=21), made horizontal and vertical visually-guided saccades, tracked a horizontal and vertical target, performed horizontal and vertical active sinusoidal head rotations in light and darkness while looking straight ahead (VOR task) or fixated straight ahead and in four directions of gaze. The eyes of each participant were videotaped and reviewed twice to determine the SBR. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The median SBR during fixation straight ahead was seven blinks/minute, which was similar to the SBR during horizontal saccades and horizontal smooth pursuit tasks. The median SBR during vertical smooth pursuit and vertical saccades were significantly lower than during fixation (p <=0.042). The median SBR during the VOR task in light and horizontal VOR in darkness were significantly higher than during fixation (p=0.019-0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The median SBR during visual fixation was lower than that reported previously in 5-14 years-old children during rest or 11-20 years-old subjects during quiet conversation. The median SBR was even lower during vertical smooth pursuit and saccades tasks. This may be due to differences in concentration required for visual fixation in general and vertical visual tasks more specifically. The higher SBR during the VOR may be due to drying of the eyes during head shaking.	0
24363186	Magnetic resonance imaging of the hip: poor cost utility for treatment of adult patients with hip pain. BACKGROUND: Although MRI is frequently used to diagnose conditions affecting the hip, its cost-effectiveness has not been defined. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We performed this retrospective study to determine for patients 40 to 80 years old: (1) the differences in hip MRI indications between orthopaedic and nonorthopaedic practitioners; (2) the clinical indications that most commonly influence treatment decisions; (3) the likelihood that hip MRI influences treatment decisions separate from plain radiographs; and (4) the cost of obtaining hip MRI studies that influence treatment decisions (impact studies). METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 218 consecutive hip MRI studies (213 patients) at one institution over a 5-year interval. Medical records, plain radiographs, and MRI studies were reviewed to determine how frequently individual MRI findings determined treatment recommendations (impact study). The cost estimate of an impact study was calculated from the product of institutional MRI unit cost (USD 436) and the proportion of impact studies relative to all studies obtained either for a specific indication or by an orthopaedic/nonorthopaedic clinician. RESULTS: Nonorthopaedic clinicians more frequently ordered hip MRI without a clinical diagnosis (72% versus 30%, p < 0.01), before plain radiographs (29% versus 3%, p < 0.001), and with less frequent impact on treatment (6% versus 15%, p < 0.05). Hip MRI most frequently influenced treatment when assessing for a tumor (58%, p < 0.001) or infection (40%, p < 0.001) and least frequently when assessing for pain (1%, p < 0.002). Hip MRI impacted a treatment decision independent of plain radiographic findings in only 7% of studies (3% surgical, 4% nonsurgical). Hip MRI cost was least when assessing for a neoplasm (USD 750) and greatest when assessing undefined hip pain (USD 59,000). The cost of obtaining an impact study was also less when the ordering clinician was an orthopaedic clinician (USD 2800) than a nonorthopaedic clinician (USD 7800). CONCLUSIONS: Although MRI can be valuable for diagnosing or staging specific conditions, it is not cost-effective as a screening tool for hip pain that is not supported by history, clinical examination, and plain radiographic findings in patients between 40 and 80 years of age.

23211071	The effect of the application of gaseous ozone and ND:YAG laser on glass-fibre post bond strength. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the application of gaseous ozone and Nd:YAG laser on glass-fibre post bond strength. Forty-two madibular premolar roots were cut, endodontically instrumented and irrigated with 2.5% NaOCl. Post spaces were prepared and roots were divided into three groups (n = 14). The antimicrobial pretreatment was conducted as follows: gaseous ozone, Nd:YAG laser and control (no additional disinfection methods). Scanning electron microscope analysis was made for each group (n = 2). A resin cement was used for luting the posts. For push-out test, each root was cut horizontally (two cervical, two middle and two apical). Statistical analyses were performed with one-way anova (a = 0.05). Fracture types were observed. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05). There were statistically significant differences in cervical and apical segments of laser and control groups (P < 0.05). The disinfection of the post spaces with Nd:YAG laser and ozone had no adverse effects on bond strength of glass-fibre post.	0

23812331	A comparison of strategies for multiple-gene co-transformation via hairy root induction. Hairy root is a transformed root tissue in which transfer DNA (T-DNA) is inserted in the genome by Agrobacterium rhizogenes. To establish a system for multiple-gene co-transformation in hairy roots, we evaluated four different strategies using A. rhizogenes. The genes gusA and mgfp5 were located in separate plasmids, which were transformed into two different batches of A. rhizogenes (strategy 2AR) or a single batch (strategy 2BV). The two reporter genes were also inserted in one T-DNA (strategy 1TD) or two different T-DNAs (strategy 2TD) in a binary vector. Over 90  % of infected Nicotiana tabacum leaf discs formed hairy roots in all four groups, which was not significantly different from the infection efficiency of wild-type A. rhizogenes. Proportions of co-transformed hairy roots with strategies 2AR, 2BV, 1TD, and 2TD were 65.4, 40.0, 78.6, and 82.1  %, respectively, which indicated that all of the strategies were suitable for co-transformation of multiple genes. High variation in growth rate and heterologous protein expression indicated that further screening is required to identify the clone with the highest productivity. Our results indicated that strategies 1TD and 2TD achieved the highest co-transformation efficiency. Combination with strategy 2AR or 2BV provides additional options for co-transformation of multiple transgenes.	0
21544104	Increase in Alphaproteobacteria in association with a polychaete, Capitella sp. I, in the organically enriched sediment. We conducted bioremediation experiments on the organically enriched sediment on the sea floor just below a fish farm, introducing artificially mass-cultured colonies of deposit-feeding polychaete, Capitella sp. I. To clarify the association between the Capitella and bacteria on the efficient decomposition of the organic matter in the sediment in the experiments, we tried to identify the bacteria that increased in the microbial community in the sediment with dense patches of the Capitella. The relationship between TOC and quinone content of the sediment as an indicator of the bacterial abundance was not clear, while a significant positive correlation was found between Capitella biomass and quinone content of the sediment. In particular, ubiquinone-10, which is present in members of the class Alphaproteobacteria, increased in the sediment with dense patches of the Capitella. We performed denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses to identify the alphaproteobacterial species in the sediment with dense patches of the worm, using two DGGE fragments obtained from the sediment samples and one fragment from the worm body. The sequences of these DGGE fragments were closely related to the specific members of the Roseobacter clade. In the associated system with the Capitella and the bacteria in the organically enriched sediment, the decomposition of the organic matter may proceed rapidly. It is very likely that the Capitella works as a promoter of bacteria in the organically enriched sediment, and feeds the increased bacteria as one of the main foods, while the bacteria decompose the organic matter in the sediment with the assistance of the Capitella.	0

21117462	Self-leadership and physical vitality. The current study examined the extension of an approach to self-leadership using strategies which focus on (1) constructive thoughts, (2) natural rewards, and (3) effective behavior. The suggested extension refers to strategies which improve physical vitality, fitness, and well-being. A sample of 163 students answered scale items selected and composed to measure the four categories of self-leadership strategies. Confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modelling indicated that strategies focusing on physical vitality, fitness, and well-being represent an independent category of self-leadership strategies. Implications for research and application were discussed.	0
12654815	Mutation of luxS affects biofilm formation in Streptococcus mutans. Quorum sensing is a bacterial mechanism for regulating gene expression in response to changes in population density. Many bacteria are capable of acyl-homoserine lactone-based or peptide-based intraspecies quorum sensing and luxS-dependent interspecies quorum sensing. While there is good evidence about the involvement of intraspecies quorum sensing in bacterial biofilm, little is known about the role of luxS in biofilm formation. In this study, we report for the first time that luxS-dependent quorum sensing is involved in biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans. S. mutans is a major cariogenic bacterium in the multispecies bacterial biofilm commonly known as dental plaque. An ortholog of luxS for S. mutans was identified using the data available in the S. mutans genome project (http://www.genome.ou.edu/smutans.html). Using an assay developed for the detection of the LuxS-associated quorum sensing signal autoinducer 2 (AI-2), it was demonstrated that this ortholog was able to complement the luxS negative phenotype of Escherichia coli DH5alpha. It was also shown that AI-2 is indeed produced by S. mutans. AI-2 production is maximal during mid- to late-log growth in batch culture. Mutant strains devoid of the luxS gene were constructed and found to be defective in producing the AI-2 signal. There are also marked phenotypic differences between the wild type and the luxS mutants. Microscopic analysis of in vitro-grown biofilm structure revealed that the luxS mutant biofilms adopted a much more granular appearance, rather than the relatively smooth, confluent layer normally seen in the wild type. These results suggest that LuxS-dependent signal may play an important role in biofilm formation of S. mutans.	0

16357786	New insight into the pathophysiology of lipid abnormalities in type 2 diabetes. Lipid abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes are likely to play an important role in the development of atherogenesis. These lipid disorders include not only quantitative but also qualitative abnormalities of lipoproteins which are potentially atherogenic. The main quantitative abnormalities are increased triglyceride levels, related to an augmented hepatic production of VLDL and a reduction of both VLDL and IDL catabolism, and decreased HDL-Cholesterol levels due to an accelerated HDL catabolism. The main qualitative abnormalities include large VLDL particles (VLDL1), relatively rich in triglycerides, small dense LDL particles, increase in triglyceride content of LDL and HDL, glycation of apolipoproteins and increased susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. Moreover, although plasma LDL-cholesterol level is usually normal in type 2 diabetic patients, LDL particles show significant kinetic abnormalities, such as reduced turn-over, which is potentially harmful. The pathophysiology of lipid abnormalities in type 2 diabetes is not yet totally explained. However, insulin resistance and the \"relative\" insulin deficiency, observed in patients with type 2 diabetes, are likely to play a crucial role since insulin has an important function in the regulation of lipid metabolism. In addition, it is not excluded that adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, could play a role in the pathophysiology of lipid abnormalities in type 2 diabetes.	0
15649621	Multi-walled carbon nanotube interactions with human epidermal keratinocytes. Carbon nanotubes have widespread applications in multiple engineering disciplines. However, little is known about the toxicity or interaction of these particles with cells. Carbon nanotube films were grown using a microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system. Human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/ml of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h. HEK were examined by transmission electron microscopy for the presence of MWCNT. Here we report that chemically unmodified MWCNT were present within cytoplasmic vacuoles of the HEK at all time points. The MWCNT also induced the release of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 8 from HEKs in a time dependent manner. These data clearly show that MWCNT, not derivatized nor optimized for biological applications, are capable of both localizing within and initiating an irritation response in a target epithelial cell that composes a primary route of occupational exposure for manufactured nanotubes.	0
20948245	[Introduction to palliative care for the oncologist-history and basic principles of palliative care]. The basic principle of palliative care has evolved over time and is the historical origin of the modern hospice. WHO proposed the first definition of palliative care in 1989, and the definition was revised in 2002. These definitions have something in common. Both relieve the pain and suffering to improve QOL. Palliative care is also good for any kind of life-threatening disease, regardless of whether it requires short or long term recuperation. That also need to be able to accept equally all the people of the community. The provision of general palliative care is the responsibility of all medical, nursing, and health professionals for the welfare of all patients with life-threatening disease. Specialist palliative care is based on the basic principles of palliative care, intensive clinical training, and systematic acquisition of knowledge and skills training to support palliative care education, clinical research and training provided by the profession. It has been established by nursing and medical experts in palliative care that palliative care can provide expertise in interdisciplinary teams in different settings. It is necessary that the medical system.	0

16217372	Urothelial neoplasms in patients 20 years or younger: a clinicopathological analysis using the world health organization 2004 bladder consensus classification. PURPOSE: Urothelial neoplasms in patients younger than 20 years are rare, with conflicting data regarding clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 23 patients 4 to 20 years old with urothelial neoplasms, reclassified the microscopic diagnoses using the 2004 WHO/International Society of Urologic Pathology grading classification and collected data on presentation, risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Pathological grading revealed 2 urothelial papillomas, 10 papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential (PUNLMPs), and 8 low grade and 3 high grade papillary urothelial cancers, all without invasion. Mean patient age was 13.2 years (range 4 to 20), 19 patients were male and 19 presented with gross hematuria. All lesions were solitary and measured 0.1 to 6 cm. One patient had a history of smoking and 1 had parents who smoked. Three patients (13%) had recurrences classified as either urothelial papilloma (1) or PUNLMP (2). All patients were alive with no evidence of disease after a mean followup of 4.5 years (range 6 months to 13 years). CONCLUSIONS: Urothelial neoplasms in individuals younger than 20 years more commonly occur in males and are predominantly low grade with a favorable clinical outcome. Before the current classification system the 10 patients with a diagnosis of PUNLMP would have been classified as having papillary carcinoma. Thus, the diagnostic category of PUNLMP allowed 43.5% of patients in this series to avoid being labeled with \"cancer\" at a young age.	0
23131863	Development and validation of a new statistical model for prognosis of long-term graft function after pediatric kidney transplantation. BACKGROUND: No adequate statistical model has been established to estimate future glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in children after kidney transplantation (KTX). Equations based on simple linear regression analysis as used in adults are not established in children. METHODS: An optimal prognostic model of GFR was generated for 63 children at 3-7 years after KTX. The main regression model for prediction of the log-transformed GFR (logGFR) included the mean monthly change of GFR in the period 3-24 months after KTX (   GFR), the baseline GFR at 3 months (bGFR), and an intercept. Additionally, we investigated if the inclusion of cofactors leads to more precise predictions. The model was validated by leave-one-out cross-validation for years 3-7 after KTX. Prognostic quality was determined with the mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Results were compared with the simple linear regression model used in adults. RESULTS: The following statistical model was calculated for every prognosis year (i   =   3,    , 7):[Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] Comparison of the new statistical model and the simple linear model for adults led to relevantly lower MSEs and MAEs for the new model (year 7: New model: MSE 0.1, MAE 0.3/adult model: MSE 1069, MAE 18). The benefit of inclusion of cofactors was not relevant. CONCLUSIONS: This statistical model is able to predict long-term graft function in children with very high precision.	0

24362379	Educating the patient for health care communication in the age of the world wide web: a qualitative study. PURPOSE: Communication skills teaching in medical education has yet to acknowledge the impact of the Internet on physician-patient communication. The authors present a conceptual model showing the variables influencing how and to what extent physicians and patients discuss Internet-sourced health information as part of the consultation with the purpose of educating the patient. METHOD: A study exploring the role physicians play in patient education mediated through health information available on the Internet provided the foundation for the conceptual model. Twenty-one physicians participated in semistructured interviews between 2011 and 2013. Participants were from Australia and Switzerland, whose citizens demonstrate different degrees of Internet usage and who differ culturally and ethnically. The authors analyzed the interviews thematically and iteratively. The themes as well as their interrelationships informed the components of the conceptual model. RESULTS: The intrinsic elements of the conceptual model are the physician, the patient, and Internet based health information. The extrinsic variables of setting, time, and communication activities as well as the quality, availability, and usability of the Internet-based health information influenced the degree to which physicians engaged with, and were engaged by, their patients about Internet-based health information. CONCLUSIONS: The empirically informed model provides a means of understanding the environment, enablers, and constraints of discussing Internet-based health information, as well as the benefits for patients' understanding of their health. It also provides medical educators with a conceptual tool to engage and support physicians in their activities of communicating health information to patients.	0

19927543	Cross-reactivity between cockroach and ladybug using the radioallergosorbent test. BACKGROUND: Home infestations from Harmonia axyridis (ladybug) occur throughout the United States. IgE-mediated sensitization with allergic disease has been reported. The prevalence of ladybug sensitization has been studied by questionnaire and allergy testing in patients diagnosed as having allergic disease. Cross-reactivity with cockroach exists. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of ladybug specific IgE in the general population by specific IgE immunoassay and to examine cross-reactivity to cockroach. METHODS: An experimental solid phase for use in immunoassay was prepared using a ladybug extract, and performance characteristics were determined. Serum samples from 100 adult blood bank donors were tested using the ladybug specific IgE immunoassay. Known ladybug IgE-positive serum samples obtained from symptomatic patients were used to study crossreactivity with German cockroach by specific IgE immunoassay inhibition. RESULTS: The mean background response of the assay solid phase was 51 fluorescent units with an analytical cutoff of 59 fluorescent units. It was estimated that a response of 88 fluorescent units corresponds to a specific IgE concentration of 0.1 kUa/L. The extinction dilution curve was linear to 0.1 kUa/L. The assay cutoff was set at 0.1 kUa/L. Of the 100 blood donor serum samples, 10 were positive for ladybug specific IgE. Inhibition assays revealed partial cross-reactivity with German cockroach. CONCLUSION: Although an immunoassay solid phase prepared with ladybug whole body extract will identify persons in a general population sensitized to epitopes found in the extract, clinicians performing allergy testing using whole body ladybug extract should be aware that a positive result may or may not indicate that exposure to actual ladybug allergens is causing sensitization.	0

21641314	An electrostatic model with weak actin-myosin attachment resolves problems with the lattice stability of skeletal muscle. The stability of the filament lattice in relaxed striated muscle can be viewed as a balance of electrostatic and van der Waals forces. The simplest electrostatic model, where actin and myosin filaments are treated as charged cylinders, generates reasonable lattice spacings for skinned fibers. However, this model predicts excessive radial stiffness under osmotic pressure and cannot account for the initial pressure (   1 kPa) required for significant compression. Good agreement with frog compression data is obtained with an extended model, in which S1 heads are weakly attached to actin when the lattice spacing is reduced below a critical value; further compression moves fixed negative charges on the heads closer to the myofilament backbone as they attach at a more acute angle to actin. The model predicts pH data in which the lattice shrinks as pH is lowered and protons bind to filaments. Electrostatic screening implies that the lattice shrinks with increasing ionic strength, but the observed expansion of the frog lattice at ionic strengths above 0.1 M with KCl might be explained if Cl(-) binds to sites on the motor domain of S1. With myosin-myosin and actin-actin interactions, the predicted lattice spacing decreases slightly with sarcomere length, with a more rapid decrease when actin-myosin filament overlap is very small.	0
8384278	[A clinical study on lomefloxacin to find appropriate dose levels in the treatment of respiratory tract infections]. A comparative clinical study of lomefloxacin hydrochloride (LFLX) was performed to confirm the optimal dose of LFLX for treatment of respiratory tract infections. Daily dosages of LFLX, 400 mg (200 mg b.i.d.) and 600 mg (200 mg t.i.d.) were allocated by the randomization method. Treatment period was 7-14 days. Of a total of 136 cases, 14 cases were excluded from evaluation of clinical efficacy and 4 cases from evaluation of safety. There were no differences in the background factors of the patients between the 2 dosage groups. The clinical efficacy rates, judged by a committee, were 76.4% (42/55) for the 400 mg group and 74.6% (50/67) for the 600 mg group. No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups (P = 1.000). Incidences of adverse effects were 1.6% (1/64) for the 400 mg group and 2.9% (2/68) for the 600 mg group. Incidences of abnormal laboratory test values were 3.4% (2/58) for the 400 mg group and 1.6% (1/63) for the 600 mg group. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups. These adverse effects and abnormal laboratory test values improved with the cessation of the administration of the drug. From these results, a dose of 400 mg (200 mg b.i.d.) LFLX seems to be better than that of 600 mg (200 mg t.i.d.) LFLX in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.	0

We measured the levels of serum carotenoids (beta-carotene), total tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbic acid and malondialdehyde (MDA) in newly diagnosed cancer cases. Levels of the antioxidants and MDA in serum samples from 208 subjects with cancer affecting different sites (59 breast, 38 head and neck, 46 genitourinary, 12 lung, 20 gastrointestinal and 33 other sites) were compared with levels in 156 controls. Cases and controls were compared with respect to a number of potentially confounding factors: age, sex, smoking status, Quetelet index (kg/m2), diet and alcohol intake. Mean (+/- SD) levels of beta-carotene, vitamin E and vitamin C were significantly lower among the cases than the controls (49.35 +/- 36.55 micrograms/l, 0.60 +/- 0.14 mg/dl, 0.40 +/- 0.27 mg/dl and 75.31 +/- 28.59 mg/dl, 0.98 +/- 0.13 mg/dl, 0.88 +/- 0.47 mg/dl, respectively) (P < 0.05). On the other hand, mean levels of MDA were significantly higher among the cases than the controls (6.79 +/- 1.22 nmol/ml and 3.52 +/- 0.97 nmol/ml, respectively) (P < 0.05). The results obtained suggest that measurement of serum antioxidants and MDA levels may provide further useful information when evaluating cancer patients.	0
18698020	Overexpression of stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor CXCR4 induces autocrine/paracrine cell proliferation in human pituitary adenomas. PURPOSE: Hypothalamic or locally produced growth factors and cytokines control pituitary development, functioning, and cell division. We evaluated the expression of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and its receptor CXCR4 in human pituitary adenomas and normal pituitary tissues and their role in cell proliferation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of SDF1 and CXCR4 in 65 human pituitary adenomas and 4 human normal pituitaries was determined by reverse transcription-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and confocal immunofluorescence. The proliferative effect of SDF1 was evaluated in eight fibroblast-free human pituitary adenoma cell cultures. RESULTS: CXCR4 mRNA was expressed in 92% of growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenomas (GHoma) and 81% of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA), whereas SDF1 was identified in 63% and 78% of GHomas and NFPAs, respectively. Immunostaining for CXCR4 and SDF1 showed a strong homogenous labeling in all tumoral cells in both GHomas and NFPAs. In normal tissues, CXCR4 and SDF1 were expressed only in a subset of anterior pituitary cells, with a lower expression of SDF1 compared with its cognate receptor. CXCR4 and SDF1 were not confined to a specific cell population in the anterior pituitary but colocalized with discrete subpopulations of GH-, prolactin-, and adrenocorticorticotropic hormone-secreting cells. Conversely, most of the SDF1-containing cells expressed CXCR4. In six of eight pituitary adenoma primary cultures, SDF1 induced a statistically significant increase in DNA synthesis that was prevented by the treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 or somatostatin. CONCLUSIONS: CXCR4 and SDF1 are overexpressed in human pituitary adenomas and CXCR4 activation may contribute to pituitary cell proliferation and, possibly, to adenoma development in humans.	0
11340684	Use of computerized tomography and chest x-rays in evaluating efficacy of aerosolized recombinant human DNase in cystic fibrosis patients younger than age 5 years: a preliminary study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) of the chest and chest x-rays (CXR) to determine efficacy of inhaled recombinant human DNase (rhDNase) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients younger than 5 years of age. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of 12 patients with CF younger than 5 years of age, attending the University of Michigan Cystic Fibrosis Center (Ann Arbor, MI) was conducted. The changes in the HRCT and CXR score from baseline to day 100 of therapy were assessed using a previously validated scoring system. The mean changes of HRCT scores between the rhDNase and placebo groups were found to be significant at the 95% level, with mean change +/- SE mean of - 1.00 +/- 0.53 and 0.58 +/- 0.24 for rhDNase and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.02). The difference in CXR score was not significant between the two groups. An analysis was performed to relate HRCT subscores to CXR score; only thickening of the intra-interlobular septae was significantly correlated with the total CXR score (r = - 0.7, P < 0.01). There was improvement in the parents' assessments of the patients' well-being, with improvement in physical activity, decreased cough, sleep quality, and appetite in those subjects receiving rhDNase. We conclude that the administration of rhDNase was associated with improvement in the HRCT scan in CF patients younger than 5 years of age. Findings indicate that HRCT of the chest is useful and sensitive in studying responses to therapy in patients with CF lung disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of HRCT to assess the effectiveness of a therapeutic modality in so young a CF patient population.	0
23110261	Mogamulizumab for the treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. T-cell neoplasms, such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, are particularly aggressive and, despite novel combination chemotherapy regimens, still have extremely poor prognoses. As such, there is an unmet medical need for novel therapies and the anti-chemokine CCR4 receptor antibody mogamulizumab (KW-0761) may offer such an option for the treatment of ATL. Mogamulizumab is a humanized antibody, with a defucosylated Fc region, which enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. As a result, mogamulizumab demonstrates potent antitumor activity at much lower doses than other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Clinical testing indicates that mogamulizumab is effective and well tolerated, with a predictable pharmacokinetic profile in patients with relapsed/refractory ATL. This drug was recently granted regulatory approval in Japan for this indication and continues to be evaluated in clinical trials in both the U.S. and Europe.	0

19501118	Alzheimer's disease genetic mutation evokes ultrastructural alterations: correlation to an intracellular Abeta deposition and the level of GSK-3beta-P(Y216) phosphorylated form. Herein we demonstrate that PC12 cells, which overexpress human wild-type amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPPwt) or AbetaPP bearing double Swedish mutation (AbetaPPsw), reveal phenotype characteristic for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The examination of cell ultrastructure showed the presence of peptide aggregates within the cells, activation of endosomal-lysosomal system and extensive exocytosis. Furthermore, the autophagy induction was also characteristic hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced cytotoxicity. Morphological changes were positively correlated with the extent of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (phospho-Tyr(216)-GSK-3beta, GSK-3beta-P(Y216)). The activity of GSK-3beta is believed to cause tau protein hyper-phosphorylation, increased amyloid-beta production and local plaque-associated microglial-mediated inflammatory responses. All of them are symptomatic for AD. In our studies, the highly significant Y216 phosphorylation and over-expression of total GSK-3beta were observed in AbetaPPsw-transfected PC12 cells. In addition, the immuocytochemical analysis showed co-localization of GSK-3beta-P(Y216) and amyloid-beta deposits. Thus, our data support a functional role of GSK-3beta in AbetaPP processing, further implicating this kinase in the amyloid-beta-dependent pathogenesis.	0
8509834	Wipe and flexion reflexes of the frog. II. Response to perturbations. 1. To evaluate the hypothesis that the neural control of sensorimotor transformations may be simplified by using a single control variable, we compared the movement kinematics and muscle activity patterns [electromyograms (EMGs)] of the frog during flexion withdrawal and the hind limb-hind limb wipe reflex before and after adding an external load. In addition, the flexibility of spinal cord circuitry underlying the hind limb-hind limb wipe reflex was evaluated by comparing wipes before and after removal of one of the contributing muscles by cutting a muscle nerve. 2. The kinematics of the movements were recorded using a WATSMART infrared emitter-detector system and quantified using principal-components analysis to provide a measure of the shape (eigenvalues) and orientation (eigenvector coefficients) of the movement trajectories. The neural pattern coordinating the movements was characterized by the latencies and magnitudes of EMGs of seven muscles acting at the hip, knee, and ankle. These variables were compared 1) during flexion withdrawal and the initial movement segment of the limb during the hind limb-hind limb wipe reflex in both unrestrained movements and in movements executed when a load equal to approximately 10% of the animal's body weight was attached to a distal limb segment and 2) during the initial movement segment of the wipe reflex before and after cutting the nerve to the knee flexor-hip extensor, iliofibularis. 3. Addition of the load had no discernible effect on the end-point position of the foot during either reflex. However, during the loaded flexion reflex, the ankle joint did not move until after the hip and knee joints had moved to their normal positions. This delayed flexion of the ankle was accompanied by large increases in the magnitude of EMG activity in two ankle muscles that exceeded the levels found during unrestrained movements. Significant changes in the temporal organization of the EMG pattern accompanied the change in joint angle relations during flexion withdrawal. 4. Despite the addition of an external load, all animals successfully and reliably removed the stimulus during the wipe reflex, and the relative timing of both the EMG pattern and joint angle motion was preserved. 5. Immediately after section of the nerve to a single muscle (iliofibularis), all animals successfully and reliably removed the stimulus during the wipe reflex. The relative timing of muscle activation was preserved, accompanied by a reduction in the activity level of gluteus magnus, a muscle with action reciprocal to iliofibularis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	0
12336723	Migration, remittances and rural development: findings of a case study in the Indian Punjab. Rural household survey data in the Ludhiana district of the Indian Punjab was used to study the nature and role of remittances in rural development. Of the 1646 outmigrants from the area since 1961, the 949 women who migrated for marriage and children under 12 years old were excluded from the study. Nearly all husbands who outmigrated had sent remittances. Parents and grandparents were 2nd and 3rd most likely to remit, but their numbers were small. Education did not correlate with remittance. Distance and time since emigration did not affect remittance. The frequency and the size of remittances are discussed. Remittances to outmigrants were insignificant. The remittances from outmigrants seem to raise the incomes and the levels of living of rural households. The remittances serve the purpose of redistributing income from urban to rural areas. Remittances also widened the gap between rich and poor in the rural areas because the better-off groups were more likely to receive remittances than the poorer groups. Most of the money sent from outmigrants was spent on consumable goods, food and clothing. Only a small proportion was spent on productive investment. This was usually done by farming families who invested in land or farm necessities. It is concluded that remittances from outmigrants can have a positive effect on the rural economies. Investment opportunities for nonagricultural families must be provided.	0
15143081	Combined use of erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor does not decrease blood transfusion requirements during induction therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma: a randomized controlled trial. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in reducing blood transfusion requirements and stimulating hematopoiesis in children with high-risk neuroblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients given six cycles of intensive induction chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma were randomized to receive G-CSF (n = 20) or G-CSF + EPO (n = 18). Cytokines were given subcutaneously each day, starting 24 hours after each chemotherapy cycle and continuing until 48 hours before the start of the next cycle. The primary end point was the effect of EPO on total red cell transfusion requirements during induction therapy. RESULTS: Patients who received G-CSF + EPO had a higher red cell transfusion requirement (median, 161.0 mL/kg) than did those who received G-CSF alone (median, 106.6 mL/kg; P =.005). In addition, among patients given transfusions for hemoglobin < or = 8 g/dL, those in the G-CSF + EPO group received more red cell transfusions than did those given G-CSF alone (median per patient, 10 v 8, respectively; P =.044). The two treatment groups had similar cumulative durations of neutropenia, incidences of febrile neutropenia, platelet transfusion requirements, and numbers of platelet transfusions; they also received induction chemotherapy for similar durations and had similar probabilities of progression-free survival and overall survival. CONCLUSION: The addition of EPO to the G-CSF regimen provides no benefit for patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma.	0
17049055	The role of hyaluronan degradation products as innate alloimmune agonists. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in initiating alloimmunity yet the substances that activate them during the host response to transplantation remain elusive. In this study we examined the potential roles of endogenous innate immune agonists in activating dendritic cell-dependent alloimmunity. Using a murine in vitro culture system, we show that 135 KDa fragments of the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan induce dendritic cell maturation and initiate alloimmunity. Priming of alloimmunity by hyaluronan-activated DCs was dependent on signaling via TIR-associated protein, a Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor downstream of TLRs 2 and 4. However, this effect was independent of alternate TLR adaptors, MyD88 or Trif. Using an in vivo murine transplant model, we show that hyaluronan accumulated during skin transplant rejection. Examination of human lung transplant recipients demonstrated that increased levels of intragraft hyaluronan were associated with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. In conclusion, our study suggests that fragments of hyaluronan can act as innate immune agonists that activate alloimmunity.	0
10446138	The adenovirus oncoprotein E1a stimulates binding of transcription factor ETF to transcriptionally activate the p53 gene. Expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an important role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage. During adenovirus infection, levels of p53 protein also increase. It has been shown that this increase is due not only to increased stability of the p53 protein but to the transcriptional activation of the p53 gene during infection. We demonstrate here that the E1a proteins of adenovirus are responsible for activating the mouse p53 gene and that both major E1a proteins, 243R and 289R, are required for complete activation. E1a brings about the binding of two cellular transcription factors to the mouse p53 promoter. One of these, ETF, binds to three upstream sites in the p53 promoter and one downstream site, whereas E2F binds to one upstream site in the presence of E1a. Our studies indicate that E2F binding is not essential for activation of the p53 promoter but that ETF is. Our data indicate the ETF site located downstream of the start site of transcription is the key site in conferring E1a responsiveness on the p53 promoter.	1

10563006	Canine zinc-responsive dermatosis. Zinc is important in a multitude of biological functions, including regulation of the immune response, modulation of keratogenesis and wound healing, maintenance of normal reproductive function, and acuity of taste and smell. Zinc-responsive dermatosis is an uncommon disease of dogs resulting from either an absolute or relative deficiency in zinc. Dermatological lesions are characterized by erythema, alopecia, scales, and crusts that primarily affect the head. Two forms of the disease exist: a familial form affecting Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies and a form that affects growing puppies fed zinc-deficient or oversupplemented diets. The history, clinical signs, and skin biopsy results are typically diagnostic. Life-long zinc supplementation is usually necessary in the familial form of the disease, although dietary correction alone may be curative in the second form. Lethal acrodermatitis is a rare inherited disorder of Bull Terriers that does not respond to zinc supplementation and is invariably fatal.	0

17032853	Treatment of cerebral aneurysms with hydrogel-coated platinum coils (HydroCoil): early single-center experience. PURPOSE: The authors report their experience using HydroCoils in the treatment of cerebral aneurysms. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the first 100 nonrandomized patients (104 coiled saccular cerebral aneurysms) treated with HydroCoils during a 27-month period. RESULTS: The average percentage of HydroCoil by length detached in treated aneurysms was 45.5% (range, 9.9-100%). Immediate postprocedure angiography demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion in 34%, neck remnant in 35%, and incomplete occlusion in 32%. Immediate procedure-related morbidity and mortality rates were 5.8% and 0%, respectively. Angiographic follow-up was obtained in 51% (51/100 patients; 53/104 aneurysms; average, 10.3 months; range, 0-31 months). In these 53 angiographically followed aneurysms, the overall recanalization rate was 21%: no recanalization occurred in 23 aneurysms with small size (<10 mm)/small neck (<4 mm) (S/S); 4 recanalizations occurred in 7 aneurysms with small size/wide neck (>4 mm) (S/W); 6 recanalizations (27%) occurred in 22 large (L) aneurysms (>10-25 mm, 70% angiographic follow-up); and 1 giant (G) (>25 mm) aneurysm recanalized. A large proportion of aneurysms that were not initially completely occluded were completely occluded on follow-up (15/43 [35%]). Clinical follow-up was obtained in 73 patients (73%; average, 5.3 months; range, 0-24 months): 93% of these patients were neurologically improved or unchanged. Three patients rehemorrhaged and 3 patients with unruptured aneurysms developed delayed hydrocephalus. CONCLUSIONS: The overall safety profile of HydroCoils appears acceptable. Preliminary midterm observations suggest less coil compaction/aneurysm recanalization in large aneurysms. However, HydroCoil-related delayed hydrocephalus is a concern.	0

8926643	The effects of ETB receptor-selective agonist on IOP and blood-aqueous barrier in rabbit eyes: role of cyclooxygenase products. The authors have reported that ET-1 and ETB receptor agonist, sarafotoxin S6c (STX-S6c), caused prolonged intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in rabbit eyes in a dose-dependent fashion when injected intravitreally. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of STX-S6c on the blood-aqueous barrier and also the possible role of cyclooxygenase products in modulating IOP. Indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (50 mg/kg), or its placebo was administered intraperitoneally 1 hour before or 1 hour before and 4 hours after the intravitreal injection of 0.5 micrograms of STX-S6c into one eye in a group of albino rabbits. The fellow eye received the vehicle only. IOP was measured prior to and periodically up to 120 hours after the injection using a calibrated pneumatonometer. One hour and 24 hours following the injection of STX-S6c (0.5 micrograms) with or without indomethacin, approximately 100 microL of aqueous humor was withdrawn by paracentesis. Protein concentration was measured by Lowry's method and PGE2 concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay. Both single and double dosings of indomethacin failed to prevent the IOP reduction caused by STX-S6c. The eyes injected with STX-S6c exhibited a significant elevation of both PGE2 and protein concentration at both 1 and 24 hours after injection. Pretreatment with indomethacin could significantly suppress the PGE2 and protein content of aqueous humor at both 1 and 24 hours after injection. ETB receptor agonist, STX-S6c, appears to induce the IOP reduction without affecting the cyclooxygenase pathway or disrupting the blood-aqueous barrier.	0

9495500	Elevated plasma corticosterone concentrations influence the onset of rigor mortis and meat color in broilers. This experiment was conducted to determine the effect of elevated plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels on meat quality characteristics. Male broilers (Arbor Acres) were either 1) fed a diet containing corticosterone (CORT) prior to processing, 2) transported by truck for 3 h before processing, or 3) processed without either of the above treatments. Six crates of birds (10 birds per crate; two crates per treatment) were stunned or killed using CO2 gas. Six birds per crate were processed and blood samples were collected during exsanguination for plasma CORT analysis. Meat samples were collected from carcasses either at 20 min or at 4 h post-mortem. At each sampling time (ST), Pectoralis superficialis samples were collected and either individually quick frozen (IQF) in liquid nitrogen or aged on ice (AOI) for 24 h prior to pH, ratio of inosine to adenosine nucleotides (R-value), cooking loss, shear value, and color analyses. The IQF Biceps femoris samples were used for pH, R-value, color, and heme pigment analysis. Mean (+/- SEM) CORT concentrations were 12.9+/-2.57, 11.7+/-1.38 and 7.9+/-0.79 ng/mL, respectively, in the CORT, transported, and control groups. There were significant treatment by ST (P < 0.05) and ST (P < 0.001) effects on the R-value of IQF P. superficialis samples. The CORT group had the highest L* value (P < 0.01) and the lowest a* value (P < 0.06). There was also a significant main effect of ST on shear values (P < 0.05) of AOI P. superficialis samples, with the means higher at 4 h than at 20 min post-mortem. The R-value of IQF B. femoris samples was markedly influenced by treatment (P < 0.001) and ST (P < 0.001). The results indicate that artificially elevating circulating CORT concentrations results in lighter meat color in broilers.	0
7142664	[Psychological repercussions of strabismus in children]. Psychomotor and behavioural disorders in 55 strabismic children are analyzed. Examinations were conducted either before or after surgery, or both before and after the operation (9 cases). Lateralization, quality of motricity, and school adaptation differed only slightly from those of pupils of the same age, in contrast to findings in previous studies. Behaviour, marked by inhibition, anxiety, and emotional disorders, improved after surgery, as shown by modifications in drawings which reflect disturbances due to strabismus and the wearing of spectacles. No correlation was found between affective disorders and ophthalmological features, the essential cause of these disorders being the manner in which others look at the child. The fact that strabismus reduces esthetic appearances is not the only reason, the symbolic nature of the eye and gaze being associated factors. Social adaptation improves after surgery, but drawings are still not completely normal. Preventive measures are proposed.	0
15677318	Cross-modal integration in a dart-poison frog. The mechanisms by which the brain binds together inputs from separate sensory modalities to effect a unified percept of events are poorly understood. This phenomenon was studied in males of the dart-poison frog Epipedobates femoralis. These animals physically and vigorously defend their territories against conspecific calling intruders. In prior field studies with an electromechanical model frog, we were able to experimentally evoke this aggressive behavior only when an auditory cue (advertisement call) was presented simultaneously with a visual cue (vocal-sac pulsations). In the present field experiments, we used a modified version of the electromechanical model frog to present territorial males with visual and auditory cues separated by experimentally introduced temporal delays or spatial disparities to probe temporal and spatial integration in this animal. In temporal integration experiments, bimodal stimuli with temporal overlap during calling bouts consistently evoked aggressive behavior; stimuli lacking bimodal temporal overlap were relatively ineffective at the same task. In spatial integration studies, despite presenting the components of the bimodal stimulus with an initial spatial disparity of up to 12 cm, fighting behavior persisted. These results demonstrate that temporal and spatial integration may be reliably estimated in a freely behaving animal in its natural habitat and that we can use aggressive behavior in this species as an index of cross-modal integration in the field.	0

Total arch replacement and reconstruction of three arch vessels were performed with hypothermic selective cerebral perfusion (SCP). To avoid atheroembolism and malperfusion to the brain, the rt. common carotid artery was perfused via the rt. subclavian artery through the dacron vascular graft and the lt. subclavian artery was cannulated and perfused distally to stenosis. <Cases 2> A 65-year-old man who had an atherosclerotic aortic arch aneurysm with severe stenosis of the brachiocephalic artery underwent operation. In the operation, extracorporeal circulation was instituted with the arterial return through the lt. subclavian artery. Same as case 1, total arch replacement and reconstruction of three arch vessels were performed under hypthermic SCP. In this case, the left common carotid artery was transected and cannulated directly into the vessel, instead of cannulation through the aortic lumen because of atheromatous plaques in the orifice of the left common carotid artery. The patients recovered uneventfully and doing well now.	0

10750225	Lessons from the London Initiative Zone Educational Incentives funding: associations between practice characteristics, funding, and courses undertaken. BACKGROUND: Following the Tomlinson report of 1992, London Initiative Zone Educational Incentives (LIZEI) funding was introduced for a three-year period to improve recruitment, retention, and educational opportunities for general practitioners working within inner London. AIM: To test the hypothesis that general practices that show evidence of good organisation achieved better access to LIZEI funding than less organised practices. METHOD: Observational practice-based study involving all 164 general practices in EAst London and the City Health Authority during the first two years of the scheme, April 1995 to March 1997. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that higher levels of LIZEI funding were associated with practices where there was evidence of good organisation, including higher targets for cervical cytology screening and immunisation rates for under two-year-olds, better asthma prescribing, and training status. Using ten practice and population explanatory variables, multiple regression models were developed for fundholding and non-fundholding practices. Among non-fundholding practices, the asthma prescribing ratio was the variable with the greatest predictive value, explaining 14.7% of the variation in LIZEI funding between practices. Strong positive associations existed between taking further degrees and diplomas, practice size, training, and non-fundholding status. CONCLUSION: Larger practices, training practices, and those that demonstrated aspects of good practice organisation gained more LIZEI funding: an example of the 'inverse funding law'. Practices within a multifund, based in the Newham locality, gained LIZEI funding regardless of practice organisation. Networks of practices, and, potentially, primary care groups, have a role in equalising the opportunities for education and development between practices in east London.	0
23347885	Assessment of skeletal stability of intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy with one-day maxillary-mandibular fixation followed by early jaw exercise. PURPOSE: Intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO) is an effective surgical technique for cases of mandibular setback, is simpler and has a lower incidence of mental paraesthesia when compared to sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO). However, IVRO has a disadvantage in the prolonged duration of postoperative maxillary-mandibular fixation (MMF) required due to the absence of rigid bone fixation. To avoid an extended MMF period, we developed a postoperative management protocol for our IVRO patients, using jaw exercises with elastic bands starting on the second day after surgery. METHODS: We evaluated the cephalometric skeletal and dental stabilities of 16 IVRO patients as they followed our protocol. RESULTS: The stabilities were confirmed and were similar to those of previous reports. CONCLUSION: One-day MMF and early initiation of jaw exercise after IVRO did not affect the jaw position stability. Moreover, our findings suggest that starting jaw exercise earlier after IVRO surgery is beneficial, as it allows patients to avoid a long period of rigid MMF so that they can resume their normal daily activities sooner.	0

9648261	Chemoenzymatic synthesis of a sialylated diantennary N-glycan linked to asparagine. A partial structure of many glycoproteins, a glycosylated asparagine carrying a complex type undecasaccharide N-glycan (Neu5Ac(alpha 2-6)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-2)Man alpha 1-3) [Neu5Ac(alpha 2-6)Gal(beta 1-4)GlcNAc(beta 1-2)Man(alpha 1-6)]Man(beta 1-4) GlcNAc(beta 1-4)GlcNAc-Asn) was obtained by total synthesis. As a starting material served a chemically synthesized diantennary heptasaccharide azide which was deprotected in a three-step sequence in high yield. The reduction of the anomeric azide was accomplished with propanedithiol in methanol-ethyldiisopropylamine. Coupling of the glycosyl amine to an activated aspartic acid gave the benzyl protected asparagine conjugate. After removal of the six benzyl functions the resulting free heptasaccharide asparagine was elongated enzymatically in the oligosaccharide part. The use of beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase and alpha-2,6-sialytransferase in the presence of alkaline phosphatase allowed the efficient transfer of four sugar units to the acceptor resulting in a full length N-glycan, a sialyated diantennary undecasaccharide-asparagine of the complex type.	0

23072457	The nervous system of Isodiametra pulchra (Acoela) with a discussion on the neuroanatomy of the Xenacoelomorpha and its evolutionary implications. INTRODUCTION: Acoels are microscopic marine worms that have become the focus of renewed debate and research due to their placement at the base of the Bilateria by molecular phylogenies. To date, Isodiametra pulchra is the most promising \"model acoel\" as it can be cultured and gene knockdown can be performed with double-stranded RNA. Despite its well-known morphology data on the nervous system are scarce. Therefore we examined this organ using various microscopic techniques, including histology, conventional histochemistry, electron microscopy, and immunocytochemistry in combination with CLSM and discuss our results in light of recently established phylogenies. RESULTS: The nervous system of Isodiametra pulchra consists of a bilobed brain with a dorsal posterior commissure, a frontal ring and tracts, four pairs of longitudinal neurite bundles, as well as a supramuscular and submuscular plexus. Serotonin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) is displayed in parts of the brain, the longitudinal neurite bundles and a large part of the supramuscular plexus, while FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity (RFLI) is displayed in parts of the brain and a distinct set of neurons, the longitudinal neurite bundles and the submuscular plexus. Despite this overlap SLI and RFLI are never colocalized. Most remarkable though is the presence of a distinct functional neuro-muscular system consisting of the statocyst, tracts, motor neurons and inner muscles, as well as the presence of various muscles that differ with regard to their ultrastructure and innervation. CONCLUSIONS: The nervous system of Isodiametra pulchra consists of an insunk, bilobed brain, a peripheral part for perception and innervation of the smooth body-wall musculature as well as tracts and motor neurons that together with pseudostriated inner muscles are responsible for steering and quick movements. The insunk, bilobed brains with two to three commissures found in numerous acoels are homologous and evolved from a ring-commissural brain that was present in the stem species of acoelomorphs. The acoelomorph brain is bipartite, consisting of a Six3/6-dependend animal pole nervous system that persists throughout adulthood and an axial nervous system that does not develop by exhibiting a staggered pattern of conserved regulatory genes as in other bilaterians but by a nested pattern of these genes. This indicates that acoelomorphs stem from an ancestor with a simple brain or with a biphasic life cycle.	0

17693306	Determination of gadolinium(III) ions in soil and sediment samples by a novel gadolinium membrane sensor based on 6-methyl-4-{[1-(2-thienyl)methylidene]amino}3-thioxo-3,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-5-(2H)-one. Highly selective and sensitive poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane electrodes based on 6-methyl-4-{[1-(2-thienyl)methylidene]amino}3-thioxo-3,4-dihydro-1,2,4-triazin-5-(2H)-one (MATDTO) as new carriers for gadolinium ion-selective electrode was reported. The membrane solutions containing PVC, o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) as plasticizer, sodium tetraphenyl borate (NaTPB) as lipophilic ionic additive, and MATDTO, displays a calibration response for Gd3+ ions over a wide concentration range of 1.0x10(-6)-1.0x10(-1) M with Nernstian slopes of 19.8+/-0.2 mV per decade and a detection limit as 5.8x10(-7) M. The sensor has a relatively fast response time of <10 s and can be used in the pH range 3.2-8.7 for at least 2 months without any significant divergence in potentials. The selectivity coefficients for mono-, di-, and trivalent cations indicate good selectivity for Gd(III) ions over a large number of interfering cations. The membrane sensor was used as an indicator electrode in the potentiometric titration of Gd(III) ions with EDTA. The proposed electrode was also applied to the determination of concentration of Gd(III) ions in soil and sediment samples and validation with CRMs.	0
15790729	Role of 14-3-3 eta as a positive regulator of the glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activation. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, mediates the effects of glucocorticoids. It is known that 14-3-3 family proteins interact with GR and regulate its transcriptional activity. They also bind to several molecules and influence many cellular events by altering their subcellular localization and/or acting as a chaperone. Recently, it has been proposed that ligand-activated degradation of GR occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway and that inhibition of proteasomal activity induces up-regulation of GR and enhances the transcriptional activity of GR. To examine the function of 14-3-3eta in the glucocorticoid-dependent signal pathway, we studied the regulatory role of 14-3-3eta in ligand-induced GR transcriptional activation. 14-3-3eta Enhanced the transcriptional activity of GR, and the levels of GR were higher in cells transfected with the 14-3-3eta expression vector in response to glucocorticoid. The GR level increased in both cytosol and nucleus, and endogenous GR was also elevated by 14-3-3eta in HeLa cells. 14-3-3eta Inhibited ligand-induced down-regulation of GR. Proteasomal inhibition did not induce any synergistic effect on the 14-3-3eta-induced increase in GR in response to glucocorticoid, and inhibition of translation did not block elevation of GR by 14-3-3eta, indicating that 14-3-3eta induces stabilization of GR. These results suggest that 14-3-3eta functions as a positive regulator in the glucocorticoid signal pathway by blocking the degradation of GR and inducing an elevation of GR, thus enhancing the transcriptional activity of GR.	0
18085959	Recovery from object substitution masking induced by transient suppression of visual motion processing: a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation study. Object substitution masking is a form of visual backward masking in which a briefly presented target is rendered invisible by a lingering mask that is too sparse to produce lower image-level interference. Recent studies suggested the importance of an updating process in a higher object-level representation, which should rely on the processing of visual motion, in this masking. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to investigate whether functional suppression of motion processing would selectively reduce substitution masking. rTMS-induced transient functional disruption of cortical area V5/MT+, which is important for motion analysis, or V1, which is reciprocally connected with V5/MT+, produced recovery from masking, whereas sham stimulation did not. Furthermore, masking remained undiminished following rTMS over the region 2 cm posterior to V5/MT+, ruling out nonspecific effects of real stimulation and confirming regional specificity of the rTMS effect. The results suggest that object continuity via the normal function of the visual motion processing system might in part contribute to this masking. The relation of these findings to the reentrant processing view of object substitution masking and other visual phenomena is discussed.	0

22896040	Renal afferent arteriolar and tubuloglomerular feedback reactivity in mice with conditional deletions of adenosine 1 receptors. Adenosine 1 receptors (A1AR) have been shown in previous experiments to play a major role in the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) constrictor response of afferent arterioles (AA) to increased loop of Henle flow. Overexpression studies have pointed to a critical role of vascular A1AR, but it has remained unclear whether selective deletion of A1AR from smooth muscle cells is sufficient to abolish TGF responsiveness. To address this question, we have determined TGF response magnitude in mice in which vascular A1AR deletion was achieved using the loxP recombination approach with cre recombinase being controlled by a smooth muscle actin promoter (SmCre/A1ARff). Effective vascular deletion of A1AR was affirmed by absence of vasoconstrictor responses to adenosine or cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA) in microperfused AA. Elevation of loop of Henle flow from 0 to 30 nl/min caused a 22.1    3.1% reduction of stop flow pressure in control mice and of 7.2    1.5% in SmCre/A1ARff mice (P < 0.001). Maintenance of residual TGF activity despite absence of A1AR-mediated responses in AA suggests participation of extravascular A1AR in TGF. Support for this notion comes from the observation that deletion of A1ARff by nestin-driven cre causes an identical TGF response reduction (7.3    2.4% in NestinCre/A1ARff vs. 20.3    2.7% in controls), whereas AA responsiveness was reduced but not abolished. A1AR on AA smooth muscle cells are primarily responsible for TGF activation, but A1AR on extravascular cells, perhaps mesangial cells, appear to contribute to the TGF response.	0
14606211	CAN'T MISS--conquer any number task by making important statistics simple. Part 3. Standard error, estimation, and confidence intervals. Healthcare quality improvement professionals need to understand and use inferential statistics to interpret sample data from their organizations. In quality improvement and healthcare research studies all the data from a population often are not available, so investigators take samples and make inferences about the population by using inferential statistics. This three-part series will give readers an understanding of the concepts of inferential statistics as well as the specific tools for calculating confidence intervals for samples of data. This article, Part 3, describes standard error and margin of error for a continuous variable and how they are calculated from the sample size and standard deviation of a sample. The article then demonstrates how the standard error and margin of error are used to calculate the confidence interval for estimating a population mean based on a sample mean.	0

19533303	Soluble TRAIL prevents RANTES-dependent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with coronary artery disease. Some factors play pathogenic roles in the development of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We measured and compared the ratio of elevated levels of regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), soluble (s) P-selectin, sE-selectin, s vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, s interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and s tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) after PCI. Plasma levels of chemokines and soluble markers were measured before and 30 days after PCI in 85 patients (61 males and 24 females, aged 61 +/- 7 years) who underwent PCI and who had repeated angiograms at a 6-month follow-up. Restenosis occurred in 29 (34.1%) patients. The significant and time-dependent increases in RANTES, sIL-2R and sVCAM-1 were observed in the restenosis group. However, there were no significant differences in sP-selectin and sE-selectin levels with or without restenosis. sTRAIL levels in patients with coronary artery disease were significantly higher than levels in normal controls. Furthermore, unlike the restenosis group, sTRAIL levels after PCI were significantly increased in the non-restenosis group, and sTRAIL levels correlated significantly with sVCAM-1 and sE-selectin. These findings suggest that restenosis development after PCI in patients with coronary artery disease involve the participation of RANTES and activated T-lymphocyte expressing CD25 after PCI, and sTRAIL may prevent this RANTES-dependent restenosis.	0

11502700	Phased chest and abdominal compression-decompression versus conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. BACKGROUND: Several methods have been developed to improve the efficacy of mechanical resuscitation, because organ perfusion achieved with conventional manual resuscitation is often insufficient. In animal studies, phased chest and abdominal compression-decompression resuscitation by use of the Lifestick device has resulted in a better outcome compared with that of conventional resuscitation. In end-of-life patients, an increased coronary perfusion pressure was achieved. The aim of the present study was to determine the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the Lifestick compared with conventional resuscitation in patients with sudden nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crews of 4 mobile intensive care units, staffed by an emergency physician and a paramedic, were trained to use the device. Fifty patients were randomized by sealed envelopes to either Lifestick (n=24) or conventional (n=26) resuscitation. No differences were found regarding demographic and logistical conditions between the groups. Nineteen of the patients (73%) with conventional resuscitation had ventricular fibrillation, 13 of whom survived to hospital admission (no survivals with other arrhythmias) and 7 were discharged. In contrast, in the Lifestick-CPR group, only 9 patients had ventricular fibrillation (38%; P=<0.02; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 0.6 to 10.6). Four of these 9 patients and 5 of 15 patients with other arrhythmias survived to hospital admission, but none survived to hospital discharge. Autopsy in a subgroup of patients who died at the scene revealed less injuries with Lifestick than with conventional resuscitation. CONCLUSION: Lifestick resuscitation is feasible and safe and may be advantageous in patients with asystole or pulseless electric activity.	0
22991449	Randomized, placebo-controlled comparison of amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin in patients with chronic diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain: impact on pain, polysomnographic sleep, daytime functioning, and quality of life. OBJECTIVE: Chronic diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) is difficult to treat, with treatment regimens often inadequate at controlling pain and limited by side effects and drug tolerance. Secondary parameters, such as quality of sleep and mood, may also be important for successful DPNP management. The objectives of this study were to compare the analgesic efficacy of pregabalin, amitriptyline, and duloxetine, and their effect on polysomnographic sleep, daytime functioning, and quality of life in patients with DPNP. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group investigation of type 1 and 2 diabetic subjects with DPNP. Each treatment group had a single-blind, 8-day, placebo run-in followed by 14 days of lower-dose and 14 days of higher-dose medication. At the end of each dose titration period, subjective pain, sleep, and daytime functioning were assessed during a 2-day residential period. RESULTS: All medications reduced pain when compared with placebo, but no one treatment was superior to any other. For sleep, pregabalin improved sleep continuity (P < 0.001), whereas duloxetine increased wake and reduced total sleep time (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). Despite negative effects on sleep, duloxetine enhanced central nervous system arousal and performance on sensory motor tasks. There were no significant safety findings; however, there was a significantly higher number of adverse events in the pregabalin treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in analgesic efficacy between amitriptyline, duloxetine, and pregabalin. However, there were significant differences in the secondary parameters, which may be of relevance when deciding the optimal treatment for DPNP.	0
20462196	Copper-catalyzed synthesis of azaspirocyclohexadienones from alpha-azido-N-arylamides under an oxygen atmosphere. A copper-catalyzed reaction of alpha-azido-N-arylamides was found to proceed under an oxygen atmosphere to afford azaspirocyclohexadienones. The present transformation is carried out by a sequence of denitrogenative formation of iminyl copper species from alpha-azido-N-arylamides and their imino-cupration with an intramolecular benzene ring on the amido nitrogen followed by consecutive formation of C=O bonds. The preliminary investigation revealed that molecular oxygen is a prerequisite for achieving the present catalytic cyclization and that one of the oxygen atoms of O(2) was found to be incorporated into the cyclohexadienone moiety.	0
18645667	[Clinical manifestations of lead levels in children exposed to automobile battery recycling processes in Soacha and Bogot  , D.C]. INTRODUCTION: Lead is a harmless metal if not handled directly in the industrial process. Even thought lead has been eliminated from the gasoline in many countries, automobile battery recycling continues to be a potential source of exposure and intoxication for the workers and their families, particularly of low income. The current investigation was initiated after an index case of lead poisoning was reported from Soacha, Cundinamarca, in central Colombia. OBJECTIVE: Clinical investigation established lead levels and lead poison frequency in children with para-occupational lead exposure in the process of recycling automobile batteries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was designed as a descriptive study, with selection of subjects with high risk of possible lead exposure. Minors, mostly of school age were recruited based on referral by relatives, neighbors or acquaintances, all of whom were involved in para-occupational exposure. Thirty two children, less than 12 years old (majority school age), were included. General and specific examinations of the children were made, and blood samples were taken for lead and hematological determinations. RESULTS: All subjects showed high levels of lead (2-9 times the maximum acceptable value) and, according to established criteria, two-thirds were rated as severely poisoned. The children with high levels of lead had tendency toward more specific hematological compromise and showing black gingival bordering (Burton border). CONCLUSION: This study communicates to the sanitary authorities and government a clear sign of alarm in that measures must be taken to diminish the occupational or para-occupational lead exposure of children by way of the automobile battery recycling industry.	0
22068374	Tensile strength and impact resistance properties of materials used in prosthetic check sockets, copolymer sockets, and definitive laminated sockets. Prosthetic sockets serve as the interface between people with amputations and their prostheses. Although most materials used to make prosthetic sockets have been used for many years, knowledge of these materials' properties is limited, especially after they are subjected to fabrication processes. This study evaluated tensile and impact properties of the current state-of-the-art materials used to fabricate prosthetic check sockets, copolymer sockets, and definitive laminated sockets. Thermolyn Rigid and Orfitrans Stiff check socket materials produced significantly lower tensile strength and impact resistance than polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). Copolymer socket materials exhibited greater resistance to impact forces than the check socket materials but lower tensile strengths than PETG. The heated molding processes, for the check socket and copolymer materials, reduced both tensile strength and elongation at break. Definitive laminated sockets were sorted according to fabrication techniques. Nyglass material had significantly higher elongation, indicating a more ductile material than carbon-based laminations. Carbon sockets with pigmented resin had higher tensile strength and modulus at break than nonpigmented carbon sockets. Elongation at yield and elongation at break were similar for both types of carbon-based laminations. The material properties determined in this study provide a foundation for understanding and improving the quality of prosthetic sockets using current fabrication materials and a basis for evaluating future technologies.	0
8933843	Cloning and expression of the alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase gene (ABF2) of Aspergillus niger in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. First-strand cDNA was prepared from mRNA of Aspergillus niger MRC11624 induced on oat spelts xylan. Using the cDNA as a template, the alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase gene (abfB) was amplified with the polymerase chain reaction technique. The abfB DNA fragment was inserted between the yeast phosphoglycerate kinase I gene promoter (PGK1P) and terminator (PGK1T) sequences on a multicopy episomal plasmid. The resulting construct PGK1P-abfB-PGK1T was designated ABF2. The ABF2 gene was expressed successfully in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and functional alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase was secreted from the yeast cells. The ABF2 nucleotide sequence was determined and verified to encode a 449-amino-acid protein (Abf2) that is 94% identical to the alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B of A. niger N400. Maximum alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activities of 0.020 U/ml and 1.40 U/ml were obtained with autoselective recombinant S. cerevisiae strains when grown for 48 h in synthetic and complex medium respectively.	0

15840657	Secretory carrier membrane proteins interact and regulate trafficking of the organellar (Na+,K+)/H+ exchanger NHE7. The mammalian (Na(+),K(+))/H(+) exchanger NHE7 resides chiefly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and post-Golgi vesicles where it is thought to contribute to organellar pH homeostasis. However, the mechanisms that underlie the targeting and regulation of NHE7 are unknown. To gain insight into these processes, yeast two-hybrid methodology was used to screen a human brain cDNA library for proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic C-terminus of NHE7. One binding partner we identified was SCAMP2, a member of the secretory carrier membrane protein (SCAMP) gene family. Direct association of these two proteins was further supported by co-immunolocalization and co-immunoprecipitation analyses using transfected cells, by their co-sedimentation in membrane fractions resolved on sucrose density gradients, and by in vitro protein binding assays. Other members of the SCAMP family, such as SCAMP1 and SCAMP5, also associated with NHE7. The majority of the NHE7-SCAMP complexes accumulated at the TGN, but a minor fraction also resided in recycling vesicles. Biochemical analyses indicated that the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of NHE7 bound preferentially to a highly conserved cytoplasmic loop between the second and the third transmembrane segments (TM2-TM3 loop) of SCAMP2. A deletion mutant of SCAMP2 lacking this region (SCAMP2/Delta184-208) bound weakly to NHE7, but caused a significant fraction of NHE7 and wild-type SCAMP2 to redistribute to a pool of scattered recycling vesicles without noticeably affecting the location of other resident TGN (syntaxin 6) or Golgi cisternae (GM130) proteins. Conversely, a GFP-tagged TM2-TM3 construct of SCAMP2 interacted with NHE7, but also led to the redistribution of NHE7 to dispersed vesicular structures. We propose a model wherein SCAMPs participate in the shuttling of NHE7 between recycling vesicles and the TGN.	0

15720522	Distribution of emamectin benzoate in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The aims of this study were to investigate the content of emamectin in blood, mucus and muscle following field administration of the recommended dose, and correlation with sea lice infection on the same fish (elimination study). The tissue distribution of tritiated emamectin benzoate after a single oral dose in Atlantic salmon was also investigated by means of whole-body autoradiography and scintillation counting (distribution study). In the elimination study, concentrations of emamectin benzoate reached maximum levels of 128, 105 and 68 ng/g (p.p.b.) for blood, mucus and muscle respectively, on day 7, the last day of administration. From day 7, the concentration in the blood declined until concentration was less than the limit of detection on day 77. The concentration was higher in mucus compared with plasma (P < 0.05) except on days 7 and 21. The concentration of emamectin benzoate decreased gradually from the end of treatment (day 7) to day 70 with half-lives of 9.2, 10.0 and 11.3 days in muscle, plasma and mucus respectively. The distribution study demonstrated a high quantity of radioactivity in mucous membranes (gastrointestinal tract, gills) throughout the observation period (56 days). Activity was high in the epiphysis, hypophysis and olfactory rosette throughout the study. The highest activity was observed in the bile, indicating this to be an important route for excretion. The distribution study confirmed the results from the elimination study with respect to concentrations in blood, skin mucous and muscle.	0
9733600	5-HT induces cAMP production in crypt colonocytes at a 5-HT4 receptor. Previous studies demonstrate that both 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) induce chloride efflux from crypt colonocytes in the rat distal colon; antagonist studies suggest that the 5-HT response is mediated primarily by the 5-HT4 receptor. Since this receptor is known to be positively coupled to adenylate cyclase, we postulated that 5-HT should induce generation of cAMP, which should be inhibited by 5-HT4 antagonists. Method. Mucosal cells from rat distal colon were taken by a sequential calcium chelation technique for enrichment of crypt cells. Cytokeratin stains demonstrated that >99% of cells were colonocytes. [3H]Thymidine uptake studies demonstrate a fivefold increased incorporation in this cell preparation compared to earlier fractions. 3-Isobutyl-l-methylxanthine (IBMX, 100 microM) was added to all cell suspensions in order to prevent cAMP metabolism. Cell suspensions were incubated for 2 min at 37 degreesC with different concentrations of 5-HT (n = 7). cAMP was measured by enzyme immunoassay. In another series of experiments, 5-HT (0.3 microM) stimulation of cAMP was similarly measured in the presence and absence of 5-HT receptor antagonists: 10 microM 5-HTP-DP (5-HT1P; n = 4), 0.1 microM ketanserin (5-HT2A; n = 4), 0.3 microM ondansetron (5-HT3; n = 4), 3 microM tropisetron (5-HT3 and 5-HT4; n = 4), and 10 nM GR-113808 (5-HT4; n = 5). Results. 5-HT produced a dose-dependent increase in cAMP. The increase was significant at concentrations >/=0.3 microM when compared to cells incubated with IBMX alone. In the second series of experiment, 5-HT-induced generation of cAMP at a dose of 0.3 microM was significantly inhibited in the presence of GR-113808 and tropisetron. Conclusion. 5-HT acts at a 5-HT4 receptor to induce production of cAMP in rat distal crypt colonocytes.	0
8962646	Immune modulators in the context of the ovulatory process: a role for interleukin-1. Recent studies have established the existence of a complete intraovarian interleukin-1 system replete with ligands, receptors, and a receptor antagonist. This article examines the hypothesis that intraovarian IL-1 may play an intermediary role in the ovulatory process. More specifically, it is hypothesized that intraovarian IL-1 beta may constitute a mediator of gonadotropins in the induction of ovulation, an effector capable of coordinating and amplifying key components of the ovulatory cascade. The insight derived from this investigation may result the elucidation of some of the molecular events underlying the ovulatory process, in the delineation of the reproductive side effects of systemic anti-IL-1 therapy, and in potentially improved strategies for the promotion of fertility or its control.	0
23213068	Circulating interferon-a2 levels are increased in the majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and are associated with disease activity and multiple cytokine activation. Mutations in interferon (IFN) regulatory factor genes and the biological activity of type I IFN on expression of specific genes that are induced by IFN have been associated with various aspects of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Circulating levels of IFN-a in SLE has not been extensively studied because of limited sensitivity of available ELISA assays. We performed a cross-sectional case-control study where circulating levels of IFN-a2 were measured by a highly sensitive, solution phase multiplex magnetized bead assay and investigated the relation of IFN-a2 with autoantibody profiles, clinical disease activity and levels of inflammatory cytokines in SLE patients (n   =   87). Cytokine levels were determined on stored sera aliquots with cut-off levels determined by the geometric mean   +   2SD in healthy controls (n   =   27). IFN-a2 levels were increased in 64% of SLE patients, who displayed more renal disease and higher disease activity (p   =   0.06) and had a significantly higher sum of activated cytokines (median 4.5, range 7) compared to patients with normal IFN-a2 (median one, range 3; p   <   0.001). Solution phase micro-bead assay thus identified increased IFN-a2 levels in two-thirds of SLE patients with longstanding disease. The association with clinical disease and activation of multiple inflammatory cytokines supports a role for IFN-a2 in disease perpetuation in a large subset of SLE patients.	0

12097386	A putative silencer element in the IL-5 gene recognized by Bcl6. The Bcl6 gene is ubiquitously expressed in adult murine tissues and its product functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor. Bcl6-deficient mice displayed eosinophilic inflammation caused by overproduction of Th2 cytokines. The regulatory mechanism of those cytokine productions by Bcl6 is controversial. When CD4(+) T cells from Bcl6-deficient and lck-Bcl6-transgenic mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 Abs, production of IL-5 among Th2 type cytokines was preferentially affected by the amount of Bcl6 in the T cells. We found a putative Bcl6-binding sequence (IL5BS) on the 3' untranslated region in the murine and human IL-5 genes, and specific binding of Bcl6 protein to the sequence was confirmed by gel retardation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The binding activity of endogenous Bcl6 was transiently diminished in Th2 but not in Th1 clones after anti-CD3 stimulation. The exogenous Bcl6 repressed expression of the reporter gene with the IL5BS in K562 cells and the repressor activity was lost by a point mutation of the IL5BS. Furthermore, the IL5BS was required for Bcl6 to repress expression of the IL-5 cDNA. Thus, the IL5BS may act as a silencer element for Bcl6 to repress expression of the IL-5 gene.	1
7713995	Early endonuclease activation following reversible focal ischemia in the rat brain. The structural changes that occur in chromatin DNA after ischemic brain injury are poorly understood. The presence of oligonucleosome fragments that are recognized as the characteristic DNA ladder has been demonstrated in global and focal ischemia, associated or not with random DNA fragmentation. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which improves DNA separation, we have now detected initial stages of DNA fragmentation that occur already 6 h after reversible focal cerebral ischemia in rats. This result confirms that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation precedes random DNA fragmentation in vulnerable striatal and cortical neurons following reversible focal cerebral ischemia.	0

8013523	Myocardial contraction patterns in non-ischaemic and ischaemic regions during acute coronary insufficiency. The effect of coronary insufficiency on the myocardial contraction pattern was studied in 11 thoracotomized cats using apical long axis echocardiograms and cross-oriented segments in the anterior midwall. Myocardial tissue blood flow was studied using radiolabelled microspheres. After circumflex coronary artery occlusion, ejection shortening increased on average 17% for circumferential segments (P < 0.05) and 61% for longitudinal segments (P < 0.001). Hyperkinesis was also validated as augmented anterior endocardial wall motion and wall thickening. Circumflex occlusion increased end-systolic sphericity of the left ventricle (P < 0.05). Subsequent underperfusion of the left coronary artery, in two discrete steps, decreased subendocardial blood flow by, on average, 36% (P < 0.001) and 75% (P < 0.001) vs the post-occlusion value, while subepicardial flow did not change. While subendocardial blood flow decreased by 36%, systolic shortening of the global major axis decreased, by, on average, 77% (P < 0.001), shortening of the longitudinal segments by 36% (P < 0.001), and systolic shortening of the minor axis by 18% (P < 0.05), whereas shortening of midwall circumferential segments did not change. This study shows that changes in myocardial contraction in both non-ischaemic and ischaemic regions during coronary insufficiency are most pronounced in the direction of the cardiac major axis.	0
8255176	Brief exposure to a novel environment enhances binding of hippocampal transcription factors to their DNA recognition elements. The behavioral regulation of transcription factor function in hippocampus, a brain region activated by novelty and important for information storage, has not been previously studied. Sixty min after a 4 min exploration of a novel space by adult albino rats, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a selective increase in specific binding to particular consensus recognition elements. For both AP-1 and CRE, an upper and lower band were observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The upper band showed increased binding restricted to the 60 min time point after exploration; no increase was observed 30 min or less, or 120 min or more after the novel experience. Increased binding to the lower of either AP-1 or CREB was observed at 30 and 120 min. When the time of exploration was increased from 4 to 15 min, no alterations in either the upper or lower band were observed in the transcription factor binding to either the AP-1 or the CRE element. Since the animals ceased to explore the environment after 10 min, the lack of binding may reflect behavioral habituation, leading to transcription factor deactivation. We conclude that brief, naturalistic stimulation can activate brain transcription factors in a time-delimited fashion, suggesting post-translational control of protein-DNA binding. We propose that promoter elements of target genes critically involved in the storage of information are turned on by environmentally-activated transcription factors.	0
15241674	Power Doppler ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute childhood pyelonephritis. In the absence of specific symptomatology in children, the early diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a challenge, particularly during infancy. In an attempt to differentiate APN from lower urinary tract infection (UTI), we evaluated the ability of power Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) to predict renal parenchymal involvement, as assessed by dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m )Tc-DMSA) scintigraphy. The study comprised 62 patients, 46 girls and 16 boys, aged 2 weeks to 5 years, admitted to the pediatric department with febrile UTI. All children were examined by PDU and DMSA scintigraphy within the first 3 days of admission. In the group of 31 patients with one or more DMSA scan abnormalities, the PDU showed a matching perfusion defect in 27 (87%). Of 26 children with normal DMSA scintigraphy, the PDU evaluation was also normal in 24. The sensitivity and specificity of PDU for the detection of affected kidneys were 87% and 92.3%, and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 93.1% and 85.7%, respectively. These data indicate the PDU has a high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating APN from lower UTI and may be a useful and practical tool for the diagnosis of APN in infants and children.	0
18573807	Asbestos fibre concentrations in the lungs of brake workers: another look. OBJECTIVE: To reanalyse data on the lung content of asbestos fibres among brake mechanics. METHODS: I re-analysed data published by Butnor, Roggli and colleagues on the lung content of chrysotile and tremolite asbestos fibres among brake mechanics and controls. Statistics of the distributions were estimated by maximum likelihood to accommodate observations below the detection limit. Mean concentrations were compared by the t-test, bootstrap resampling and interval-censored survival methods. RESULTS: The mean concentrations of fibres were higher among the brake workers than the controls. The concentration of tremolite fibres was higher than the concentration of chrysotile, a pattern similar to that observed among Quebec chrysotile miners and millers. CONCLUSIONS: Re-analysis of published data does not support the interpretation that, in automotive brake repair workers with malignant mesothelioma, asbestos content is within the normal range. The alternative interpretation that brake mechanics have a greater than background burden of asbestos fibres, attributable to occupational exposure to dusts from friction products manufactured from Canadian chrysotile, appears more credible. This asbestos burden might be associated with an increased risk of asbestos-associated cancers.	0
8413591	Crystal structure of the DsbA protein required for disulphide bond formation in vivo. Proteins that contain disulphide bonds are often slow to fold in vitro because the oxidation and correct pairing of the cysteine residues is rate limiting. The folding of such proteins is greatly accelerated in Escherichia coli by DsbA, but the mechanism of this rate enhancement is not well understood. Here we report the crystal structure of oxidized DsbA and show that it resembles closely the ubiquitous redox protein thioredoxin, despite very low sequence similarity. An important difference, however, is the presence of another domain which forms a cap over the thioredoxin-like active site of DsbA. The redox-active disulphide bond, which is responsible for the oxidation of substrates, is thus at a domain interface and is surrounded by grooves and exposed hydrophobic side chains. These features suggest that DsbA might act by binding to partially folded polypeptide chains before oxidation of cysteine residues.	0
12192169	Retrospective population-based assessment of medically attended injection site reactions, seizures, allergic responses and febrile episodes after acellular pertussis vaccine combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. BACKGROUND: Since 1997 diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines have been recommended for the five dose pertussis vaccination series. To assess rates of medically attended injection site reactions (ISRs), seizures, allergic responses and febrile episodes after Tripedia DTaP vaccine administered in the context of routine care, we conducted a retrospective assessment among the population of Group Health Cooperative from 1997 through 2000. METHODS: Administrative databases were used to identify medical visits linked with diagnostic codes potentially indicative of ISRs, seizures, allergic responses and febrile episodes after DTaP vaccine. Outcomes were confirmed by medical record review. RESULTS: During the study period 76 133 doses of DTaP were administered. Of the 26 ISRs identified, 6 followed DTaP given as the fourth dose and 18 followed DTaP given as the fifth dose, for rates of 1 per 2779 and 1 per 900 vaccinations, respectively. During the study period nearly all children receiving DTaP as the fifth dose had received whole cell pertussis vaccine for their primary series, and all of the fifth dose ISRs were among that group. Four of those reactions involved the entire upper arm. The rate of febrile seizures within 2 days of DTaP among children <2 years of age was 1 per 19 496 vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS: The low rate of febrile seizures and other serious events confirms the safety of DTaP vaccine. The risk of medically attended ISRs was highest with DTaP given as the fifth dose, and whole arm reactions were reported, but medically attended ISRs were relatively uncommon and were self-limited.	0

19905941	A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of implant length on the survival of rough-surface dental implants. BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis on the survival of short implants compared to conventional implants has never been performed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to address the focused question \"Is there a significant difference in survival between short (<or=8 or <10 mm) and conventional (>or=10 mm) rough-surface dental implants placed in 1) totally or 2) partially edentulous patients?\" by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies published in the dental literature in the English language up to and including August 2007. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases were scanned electronically, and seven journals were searched manually. In the first phase of selection, titles and abstracts, and in the second phase, full texts, were evaluated autonomously and in duplicate by two reviewers. Extensive contact with authors was carried out in search of missing, unclear, or unpublished data. RESULTS: The electronic and manual search provided, respectively, 1,056 and 14,417 titles and abstracts. In the second phase of selection, the complete text of 300 articles was examined, and 37 articles reporting on 22 patient cohorts were selected. Meta-analyses revealed no statistically significant difference in survival between short (<or=8 or <10 mm) and conventional (>or=10 mm) rough-surface implants placed in totally or partially edentulous patients. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this systematic review, the placement of short rough-surface implants is not a less efficacious treatment modality compared to the placement of conventional rough-surface implants for the replacement of missing teeth in either totally or partially edentulous patients.	0
21851935	Fishing, fish consumption and advisory awareness among Louisiana's recreational fishers. This paper presents results from the first known population-based survey of recreational fishers in Louisiana (n=1774). The ultimate goal of this study was to obtain data in support of the development of regional advisories for a high exposure population with unique seafood consumption patterns. Between July and August of 2008, a survey was mailed to a random sample of licensed recreational fishers to characterize local fishing habits, sportfish consumption, and advisory awareness. Eighty-eight percent of respondents reported eating sportfish. Respondents ate an estimated mean of four fish meals per month, of which, approximately half were sportfish. Over half of all sportfish meals (54%) were caught in the Gulf of Mexico or bordering brackish areas. Sportfish consumption varied by license and gender; and was highest among Sportsman's Paradise license holders (2.8  0.2 meals per month), and males (2.2  0.1 meals per month). The most frequently consumed sportfish species were red drum, speckled trout, catfish, bass, crappie and bream. Advisory awareness rates varied by gender, ethnicity, geographic area, license type, age and education; and were lowest among women (53%), African-Americans (43%), fishers from the southeast of Louisiana (50%), holders of Senior Hunting and Fishing licenses (51%), individuals between 15 and 19 years of age (41%), and individuals with less than a high school education (43%). Results were used to identify ways to optimize monitoring, advisory development and outreach activities.	0
7949145	Activation of phospholipase D by interleukin-8 in human neutrophils. Interleukin 8 (IL-8), a member of the C-X-C branch of the chemokine superfamily, stimulated the breakdown of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([3H]EAPC) and the formation of 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-phosphatidic acid ([3H]-EAPA) in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the presence of cytochalasin B. In addition, the mass of diradyl-PA was increased with similar kinetics. In the presence of ethanol, 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-acyl-phosphatidylethanol ([3H]EAPEt) was formed at the expense of [3H]EAPA formation, indicating the activation of phospholipase D by the cytokine. The effect was time- and concentration-dependent, reaching a plateau at 30 seconds with the maximally activating concentration of 120 nmol/L IL-8. Preincubation of cells with 1 microgram/mL Bordetella pertussis toxin inhibited the breakdown of [3H]EAPC and [3H]EAPA formation, indicating a role for a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanosine triphosphate-binding protein. Formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) correlated with activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, the oxidative burst enzyme, with both events occurring in the same concentration range. Inhibition of PA formation, by the presence of ethanol, also inhibited the oxidative burst stimulation by IL-8. Pretreatment of PMN with 10 nmol/L platelet-activating factor potentiated both [3H]EAPA accumulation and activation of NADPD oxidase by IL-8. Collectively, these data show that IL-8 stimulates the metabolism of choline-containing phosphoglycerides in human PMN and support a role for PA in the signaling mechanisms used by IL-8 to stimulate PMN function.	0

11357205	Keeping clean water clean in a Malawi refugee camp: a randomized intervention trial. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the ability of a water container with a cover and a spout to prevent household contamination of water in a Malawian refugee camp. METHODS: A randomized trial was conducted in a refugee population that had experienced repeated outbreaks of cholera and diarrhoea and where contamination of water in the home was found to be a significant cause of cholera. Four hundred Mozambican refugee households were systematically identified and followed over a 4-month period, one fourth of the households were randomly assigned to exclusively use the improved container for water collection. FINDINGS: Water flowing from the source wells had little or no microbial contamination although the water collectors quickly contaminated their water, primarily through contact with their hands. Analysis of water samples demonstrated that there was a 69% reduction in the geometric mean of faecal coliform levels in household water and 31% less diarrhoeal disease (P = 0.06) in children under 5 years of age among the group using the improved bucket. Regression models examining diarrhoea among under 5-year-olds confirmed the protective effect of the bucket and found that visible faeces in the family latrine and the presence of animals were significantly associated with an increased diarrhoeal incidence in children. CONCLUSION: Household contamination of drinking-water significantly contributed to diarrhoea in this population. Proper chlorination is a less expensive and more effective means of water quality protection in comparison with the improved bucket, but was unpopular and rarely utilized by the camp inhabitants.	0
7079658	The demonstration of lymphatic channels on wrist arthrography in rheumatoid disease with particular reference to associated lymphoedema. Delineation of lymphatic vessels is a frequent finding in arthrograms of rheumatoid joints. Arthrography of the rheumatoid wrist when associated with oedema of the upper limb reveals a characteristic pattern consistent with lymphatic obstruction. In our opinion, these findings may be regarded as further evidence in favour of lymphatic obstruction as the cause of peripheral oedema in rheumatoid arthritis. The syndrome appears to be a separate entity from idiopathic oedema of women.	0
9146265	The relationship between role conception and ethical behaviour of student nurses in Hong Kong. This paper was designed to explore the relationships of three role conception types (the professional, bureaucratic and service role conceptions) to the ethical behaviour of student nurses from the apprenticeship and degree nursing programmes in Hong Kong. The effect of role discrepancy on ethical behaviour will also be explored. A nonprobability convenience sampling of 140 certificate students from a hospital-based training course and 81 degrees nursing students from a tertiary programme were selected. Role conception and role discrepancy were measured by the modified Nursing Role Conception scale originally developed by Corwin. For ethical behaviour, the Judgement About Nursing Decisions scale developed by Ketefian was used. Multiple regression analyses showed that the ideal professional role conception was a significant predictor, accounting for 17% of the variance in the ideal ethical score of the degree students. Actual service role conception was a better predictor of the actual ethical score, explaining 10% and 14% of its variance for the certificate and degree students respectively. Professional and bureaucratic role discrepancies together were found to have a negative effect on the actual ethical behaviour of the degree students. These results suggest that professional values that have been developed through socialization in nurse education programmes could benefit patients only when degree students, in particular, could adapt successfully to the demands of bureaucratic organization.	0

15295607	A long-term follow-up of 33 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received the BEAM high-dose intensification regimen with cytokine support only and no transplant. High-dose intensification and autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is widely used to consolidate patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), who have reached a stage of minimal residual disease. However, patients with persisting marrow and/or blood involvement and those who fail peripheral blood hemopoietic progenitor mobilization are excluded from ASCT. For such patients with no available graft to infuse, we developed 15 years ago, before the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapeutic era, the use of the BEAM pretransplant regimen followed only by the administration of three cytokines (erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). We report here on the long-term follow-up of 33 patients treated with this approach. In all, 33 NHL patients underwent the BEAM (carmustine, VP-16, cytosine-arabinoside, melphalan) followed by the administration of the three cytokines from January 1994-2000. A backup marrow, albeit infiltrated by tumor cells, had been collected earlier and stored in all. A total of 30 patients (91%) recovered normal hematopoiesis. In total, 32 patients (97%) recovered neutrophils (>500/microl) at a median of 19 days and 30 patients (91%) recovered platelets (>20,000/microl) at a median of 26 days. Age, richness of backup graft and blood-hemoglobin level at intensification had an impact on the time for hematopoietic recovery (P=0.014, P=0.014, P=0.048). The median follow-up was 62 months. Five patients died from toxicity related to the procedure. Eight patients relapsed and died. A total of 20 patients (61%) are alive, 16 (49%) in complete remission. A 5-year disease-free survival was 52+/-9%, relapse incidence 35+/-16%, mortality due to the procedure 12+/-12% and overall survival 61+/-10%. The BEAM regimen is not myeloablative. The BEAM+3CK procedure is a feasible therapeutic option that has shown efficacy in poor risk NHL patients who were not eligible for autografting because of persisting marrow/blood tumor contamination, or poor hemopoietic progenitor harvesting. It is unclear today whether some of these patients would have cleared their marrow/peripheral blood with the additional use of anti-CD20 treatment, thereby making the classical approach (BEAM followed by the infusion of a clean autograft) feasible.	0

19679118	The cis-regulatory system of the tbrain gene: Alternative use of multiple modules to promote skeletogenic expression in the sea urchin embryo. The genomic cis-regulatory systems controlling regulatory gene expression usually include multiple modules. The regulatory output of such systems at any given time depends on which module is directing the function of the basal transcription apparatus, and ultimately on the transcription factor inputs into that module. Here we examine regulation of the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus tbrain gene, a required activator of the skeletogenic specification state in the lineage descendant from the embryo micromeres. Alternate cis-regulatory modules were found to convey skeletogenic expression in reporter constructs. To determine their relative developmental functions in context, we made use of recombineered BAC constructs containing a GFP reporter and of derivatives from which specific modules had been deleted. The outputs of the various constructs were observed spatially by GFP fluorescence and quantitatively over time by QPCR. In the context of the complete genomic locus, early skeletogenic expression is controlled by an intron enhancer plus a proximal region containing a HesC site as predicted from network analysis. From ingression onward, however, a dedicated distal module utilizing positive Ets1/2 inputs contributes to definitive expression in the skeletogenic mesenchyme. This module also mediates a newly discovered negative Erg input which excludes non-skeletogenic mesodermal expression.	0

11173267	Exploiting human genetic variation in drug discovery and development. 'The right drug for the right patient at the right time'Is this a realistic goal for today's pharmaceutical industry and tomorrow's medical practitioner? Or merely an over-simplistic refrain that can only ever be an unfulfilled dream? Here we discuss the reality behind the dream and illustrate how the analysis of genetic variation is a complex science that has the capacity to make significant contributions to drug discovery and development strategies. An understanding of the impact of human variation must be a central consideration in the future practice of pharmaceutical R_D.	0
21945545	Increase of galectin-3 expression in microglia by hyperthermia in delayed neuronal death of hippocampal CA1 following transient forebrain ischemia. The ischemic damage in the hippocampal CA1 region following transient forebrain ischemia, delayed neuronal death, is a typical apoptotic response, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We have reported that mild hyperthermia (38   C) accelerates DNA fragmentation of the gerbil CA1 pyramidal neurons following transient forebrain ischemia. Recently, we reported that galectin-3, a b-galactosidase-binding lectin, is spatio-temporally expressed only by activated microglial cells located within CA1 region following transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils. Furthermore, expression of galectin-3 and Iba-1 (a specific microglial cell marker) are strongly reduced by hypothermia during ischemic insult. To further elucidate the effect of hyperthermia on the expression of galectin-3 by micloglia in delayed neuronal death, we examined immunohistochemical expression of galectin-3 and Iba-1, in situ terminal dUTP-biotin nick end labeling of DNA fragmentation (for determination of cell death) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (for morphological observation). We observed that between 37   C and 39   C, there was a temperature-dependent enhancement of galectin-3 expression in microglial cells in the CA1 region following transient ischemia. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation, detected by TUNEL staining, was observed in CA1 region in normothermia. This TUNEL staining was enhanced by hyperthermia at 37.5   C and 38   C, but not at 39   C. Ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration in CA1 region in gerbil hippocampus subjected to hyperthermia (37.5   C, 38   C and 39   C) observed by HE staining is similar to that in normothermic gerbils. These findings imply that galectin-3 expression in microglia may influence the survival of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cases such as hyperthermia-related neuronal injury.	0
8757426	Menstrual function in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. To assess whether HIV infection is associated with menstrual abnormalities in HIV-infected women without AIDS, we evaluated 248 premenopausal HIV-infected women without AIDS and 82 HIV-negative women. Detailed medical, drug use, and menstrual histories (using menstrual calendars) were obtained. Complete physical and pelvic examinations and CD4 counts were performed. HIV-infected women were more likely to experience intervals > 6 weeks without menstrual bleeding [8 vs. 0%, odds ratio (OR) = 10.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-1,000) and amenorrhea > 3 months (5 vs. 0%, OR = 7.1, 95% CI 1.1-1,000) (after adjustment for drug use, age, and race). Premenstrual breast swelling (p = 0.01), tenderness (p = 0.01), and dysmenorrhea (p = 0.04) were less common in HIV-infected women. There were no differences in intermenstrual bleeding or irregular menstrual cycles. Among HIV-infected women, only a past history of substance abuse was significantly associated with menstrual irregularities in a logistic regression model adjusting for age, current and past drug use, alcohol use, cigarette smoking, CD4 count, and category B conditions [1993 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification system]. The increase in amenorrhea (> 3 months) and in menstrual cycle intervals > 6 weeks and the lower rates of premenstrual breast symptoms in HIV-positive women suggest the possibility of disturbances in menstrual function that do not appear to be attributable to clinically apparent secondary complications of HIV. Changes in menstrual function were also significantly associated with a past history of, but not current, substance abuse, suggesting the possibility that socioeconomic factors rather than biologic effects of drugs may be responsible.	0

21252475	Early detection of preeclampsia using inhibin a and other second-trimester serum markers. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether second-trimester maternal serum markers including inhibin A are useful for the detection of preeclampsia. METHODS: Between January 2005 and March 2009, we analyzed the data of 4,764 subjects who underwent second-trimester multiple-marker screening for Down syndrome. Serum samples were assayed at 15+0 to 20+6 weeks for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), unconjugated estriol (uE(3)) and inhibin A. We reviewed all medical records retrospectively, and assessed the relationships of several markers with preeclampsia using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The study sample included 41 patients who developed preeclampsia and a control group consisting of the other 4,723 healthy subjects treated between January 2005 and March 2009. There were no significant differences in gestational ages at blood sampling, maternal weights, gravidity and parity between the two groups. However, the mean ages, Apgar scores, gestational age at delivery and neonatal weights were significantly different between the study group and the control group. The levels of markers in the study group were significantly increased compared to the control group, 1.76    2.68 for inhibin A, 1.18    0.69 for MSAFP, and 1.62    1.18 for hCG, but uE(3) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The AUC of inhibin A was 0.715, but the AUC of a three-marker combination model (0.800) was even better. A mid-trimester inhibin A concentration of 1.5 MoM or greater had a sensitivity of 60% and a false-positive rate of 16% for the prediction of preeclampsia. Inhibin A was the best predictor of preeclampsia. Three other markers were reliable predictive markers of preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibin A and other second-trimester serum markers may be useful for early detection of preeclampsia. Inhibin A was in fact the most important predictable marker among the markers we surveyed. The results of this study support those of previous studies, and provide quantified data elucidating the occurrence of preeclampsia.	0

21033027	Forestier disease: single-center surgical experience and brief literature review. OBJECTIVES: We describe the experience of our otolaryngology department in the treatment of Forestier disease, particularly regarding the diagnostic process, surgical treatment, and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: The charts of 12 patients who underwent surgical treatment of Forestier disease between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2009, were analyzed. All patients were subjected to clinical, radiologic, and endoscopic evaluation that confirmed the presence of cervical osteophytes. All patients were treated by a right-sided prevascular transcervical approach to remove cervical osteophytes. A literature review on Forestier disease was also carried out. RESULTS: One case of immediate postoperative hemorrhage was reported. During the postoperative follow-up, ranging from 1 to 5 years, all patients underwent cervical radiography and fiberoptic laryngoscopy that confirmed no evidence of recurrence, and all patients remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: A prevascular transcervical right-sided approach seems to be an effective treatment for surgical removal of hyperostosis in Forestier disease, with an acceptable rate of complications and recurrence.	0
15603510	Biochemistry and clinical role of human cystatin C. Low molecular-mass plasma proteins play a key role in health and disease. Cystatin C is an endogenous cysteine proteinase inhibitor belonging to the type 2 cystatin superfamily. The mature, active form of human cystatin C is a single non-glycosylated polypeptide chain consisting of 120 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of 13,343-13,359 Da, and containing four characteristic disulfide-paired cysteine residues. Human cystatin C is encoded by the CST3 gene, ubiquitously expressed at moderate levels. Cystatin C monomer is present in all human body fluids; it is preferentially abundant in cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma, and milk. Cystatin C L68Q variant is an amyloid fibril-forming protein with a high tendency to dimerize. It forms self-aggregates with massive amyloid deposits in the brain arteries of young adults, leading to lethal cerebral hemorrhage. The main catabolic site of cystatin C is the kidney: more than 99% of the protein is cleared from the circulation by glomerular ultrafiltration and tubular reabsorption. The diagnostic value of cystatin C as a marker of kidney dysfunction has been extensively investigated in multiple clinical studies on adults, children, and in the elderly. In almost all the clinical studies, cystatin C demonstrated a better diagnostic accuracy than serum creatinine in discriminating normal from impaired kidney function, but controversial results have been obtained by comparing this protein with other indices of kidney disease, especially serum creatinine-based equations. In this review, we present and discuss most of the available data from the literature, critically reviewing conclusions and suggestions for the use of cystatin C in clinical practice. Despite the multitude of clinical data in the literature, cystatin C has not been widely used, perhaps because of a combination of factors, such as a general diffidence among clinicians, the absence of definitive cut-off values, conflicting results in clinical studies, no clear evidence on when and how to request the test, the poor commutability of results, and no accurate examination of costs and of its routine use in a stat laboratory.	0
22777228	Treatment outcomes for tinea capitis in a skin of color population. BACKGROUND: Tinea capitis periodically undergoes demographic shifts in causative dermatophyte and therapeutic response to oral anti-fungal therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalent fungal species and response to standard antifungal therapy in inner-city children of color. METHODS: An IRB-approved chart review of demographic, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic data was conducted for children and young adults (0 to 18 years of age) who had scalp fungal culture performed for scalp hyperkeratosis and/or alopecia over a 2.5 year time-period. Supplemental parental phone interview was performed for missing data points. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients with final diagnosis of tinea capitis were identified-52% male, 60.6% African-American, 28.2% Hispanic, and 9.9% Caucasian. Complete resolution at 4 weeks was uncommon in all demographic groups (Hispanic: 11.7%, African-American: 41.3%). The Hispanic group and the youngest patients (aged less than 4 years) were less likely to respond to initial therapy, but the results were not significant. Of the 80 tinea capitis patients initially treated with griseofulvin, 41 out of 54 children (76%) had complete response to micronized suspension +/- crushed tablet (33% required shift to tablets from suspension) and 20 out of 26 (76.9%) cleared on crushed tablets alone. Of the 19 griseofulvin failures, 5 cleared on fluconazole suspension, 7 on terbinafine sprinkles, 3 on itraconazole therapy, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Of the 47 patients who could be evaluated long-term after a single course of oral griseofulvin at 6 weeks or greater, 38 had documented long-term mycological cure (80.8%) and 42 had long-term clinical cure (89%). Trichophyton tonsurans (n=40) was the most prevalent causative species identified on culture, followed by Alternaria species (n=10) and Microsporum canis (n=1). LIMITATIONS: Retrospective chart review: patient population has a high rate of usage of over-the-counter antifungal creams and shampoos, affecting culture results. CONCLUSIONS: Tinea capitis is still the most common cause of Trichophyton tonsurans in New York City. Response rates to griseofulvin are similar to rates seen in the 1970s, but require higher dosing and conversion to crushed tablets in partial responders. Usage of crushed ultramicronized griseofulvin, terbinafine sprinkles, itraconazole, and fluconazole are alternative regimens for those children whose tinea capitis does not clear on griseofulvin suspension.	0

22894707	S-nitrosoglutathione and endothelial nitric oxide synthase-derived nitric oxide regulate compartmentalized ras S-nitrosylation and stimulate cell proliferation. AIMS: S-nitrosylation of Cys118 is a redox-based mechanism for Ras activation mediated by nitric oxide (NO) at the plasma membrane. RESULTS: Ras signaling pathway stimulation by 50 and/or 100    M of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) causes proliferation of HeLa cells. Proliferation was not observed in HeLa cells overexpressing non-nitrosatable H-Ras(C118S). HeLa cells overexpressing H-Ras(wt) containing the spatiotemporal probe green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (GFP-RBD) incubated with 100    M GSNO stimulated a rapid and transient redistribution of GFP-RBD to the plasma membrane, followed by a delayed and sustained recruitment to the Golgi. No activation of H-Ras at the plasma membrane occurred in cells overexpressing H-Ras(C118S), contrasting with a robust and sustained activation of the GTPase at the Golgi. Inhibition of Src kinase prevented cell proliferation and activation of H-Ras by GSNO at the Golgi. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stimulated with bradykinin to generate NO were used to differentiate cell proliferation and Ras activation at the plasma membrane versus Golgi. In this model, Src kinase was not involved in cell proliferation, whereas Ras activation proceeded only at the plasma membrane, indicating that HUVEC proliferation induced by NO resulted only from stimulation of Ras. INNOVATION: The present work is the first to demonstrate that NO-mediated activation of Ras in different subcellular compartments regulates different downstream signaling pathways. CONCLUSION: S-nitrosylation of H-Ras at Cys(118) and the activation of Src kinase are spatiotemporally linked events of the S-nitrosothiol-mediated signaling pathway that occurs at the plasma membrane and at the Golgi. The nonparticipation of Src kinase and the localized production of NO by endothelial NO synthase at the plasma membrane limited NO-mediated Ras activation to the plasma membrane.	0
14604410	Invariant manifolds of an autonomous ordinary differential equation from its generalized normal forms. A method to approximate some invariant sets of dynamical systems defined through an autonomous m-dimensional ordinary differential equation is presented. Our technique is based on the calculation of formal symmetries and generalized normal forms associated with the system of equations, making use of Lie transformations for smooth vector fields. Once a symmetry is determined up to a certain order, a reduction map allows us to pass from the equation in normal form to a related equation in a certain reduced space, the so-called reduced system of dimension s<m. Now, under certain regularity conditions, a nondegenerate p-dimensional invariant set of the reduced system is formally transformed into a (p+m-s)-dimensional invariant set of the original equation. Moreover, the existence of some actual (p+m-s)-dimensional invariant manifolds of the initial equations related to the ones determined through our analysis can be proven under certain hypotheses that we make explicit. The procedure is illustrated by characterizing the set of all periodic orbits sufficiently close to the origin of the Hamiltonian vector field defined by the Henon and Heiles family.	0
11238074	The art of pedigree drawing: algorithmic aspects. MOTIVATION: Giving a meaningful representation of a pedigree is not obvious when it includes consanguinity loops, individuals with multiple mates or several related families. RESULTS: We show that finding a perfectly meaningful representation of a pedigree is equivalent to the interval graph sandwich problem and we propose an algorithm for drawing pedigrees.	0
20418992	Coexistence of papulonecrotic tuberculide with lichen scrofulosorum. Tuberculides, the supposedly immunologic reactions to the products of dead Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli deposited in the skin from distant foci of tubercular infection, are presently considered to be of two types-papulonecrotic tuberculide and lichen scrofulosorum. Simultaneous occurrence of both the types in the same patient is very rare. We report the case of an adult male without any known internal tubercular focus who showed two types of skin lesions, clinically typical and histopathologically consistent with the diagnoses of papulonecrotic tuberculide and lichen scrofulosorum, occurring simultaneously. Polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in papulonecrotic tuberculide type of lesion, and both types of lesions responded promptly to anti-tubercular drugs.	0
21104860	Altered MEF2 isoforms in myotonic dystrophy and other neuromuscular disorders. Because of their central role in muscle development and maintenance, MEF2 family members represent excellent candidate effectors of the muscle pathology in myotonic dystrophy (DM). We investigated the expression and alternative splicing of all four MEF2 genes in muscle from neuromuscular disorder (NMD) patients, including DM1 and DM2. We observed MEF2A and MEF2C overexpression in all NMD muscle, including 12 MEF2-interacting genes. Exon 4 and 5 usage in MEF2A and MEF2C was different between DM and normal muscle, with DM showing the embryonic isoform. Similar splicing differences were observed in other NMD muscle. For MEF2C, missplicing was more pronounced in DM than in other dystrophies. Our data confirm dysregulation of MEF2A and MEF2C expression and splicing in several NMD, including DM. Our findings demonstrate that aberrant splicing in NMD is independent from expression of mutant repeats, and suggests that some aberrant splicing, even in DM, may be compensatory rather than primary.	0
23232673	Human papillomavirus, vaccines, and protection from cervical cancer. Current published data makes clear the relationship between genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer. Although there is an opportunity for screening programs that could obviate the disease, cervical cancer still remains the second most common cancer among women worldwide. The subtypes HPV 16 and 18 affect the anogenital tract mucosal surfaces, and accounts for nearly 70% of all cervical cancers, and 90% or more of anal cancer cases. When the 493,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 274,000 deaths per year are taken into consideration, the importance of treatment and prophylaxis modalities for HPV can clearly be recognized. With the molecular and epidemiological studies that have focused on the oncogenicity and immunobiological structure of HPV, the main strategy is to develop prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Here, recent data concerning HPV infections and vaccination is discussed.	0
19583708	Thiopental pharmacokinetics in newborn infants: a case report of overdose. Thiopental may be used for sedation before intubation in newborn infants. A boy, born at 33 weeks of gestation (gw); birth weight 2435 g, was prescribed thiopental 3 mg/kg before intubation. He developed temporary hypotension and oxygen desaturation, and remained unconscious for longer than expected with a suppressed electroencephalography for 48 h. Serum thiopental concentration was 82, 59, 42 and 32 micromol/L after 20 min and 6, 24 and 68 h respectively. Serum concentrations from five newborn infants at the same time points after intubation with the same thiopental dose were used as reference values, and indicated a 10-fold overdose in the index case. The cause of the overdose could not be identified. The infant recovered; cerebral magnetic resonance imaging at the age of 42 gw and psychomotor development at 2 years were normal. These results show that thiopental concentrations are variable in neonates and there is a high risk of dosage error as no specific paediatric formulation is available. CONCLUSION: Well-designed procedures and continuous education are required to prevent errors and adverse events during drug delivery to newborn infants. To develop a safe method of administration for thiopental, an extended pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study in neonates is warranted.	0
19657516	Prevention of shaken baby syndrome: Never shake a baby. Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) represents injuries to the head, skeleton and eyes of a young child and is the leading cause of fatal or life-threatening child abuse. SBS is preventable. The dangers and consequences of shaking a baby are not well appreciated by the general public. Simple educational programs and community nursing support programs have been shown to be helpful. Inadequate physician training and knowledge in child maltreatment have also been identified as problems. This article outlines the evidence for interventions in the prevention of SBS and recommendations for health care providers and educators.	0
21547705	Mechanisms of mTOR inhibitor resistance in cancer therapy. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell cycle progression, protein translation, metabolism, and cellular proliferation. The mTOR pathway promotes cell proliferation under energy or nutrient-rich conditions by increasing ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. Since enhanced activity of the mTOR pathway is frequently observed in malignant cells, inhibition of this kinase has become an attractive strategy to treat cancer. Rapamycin and its analogs temsirolimus, everolimus, and ridaforolimus referred to as \"rapalogs\" have demonstrated promising efficacy against renal cell carcinoma and are under investigation for the treatment of other malignancies. However, the emergence of drug resistance may ultimately limit the utility of rapalog therapy. Here we summarize the known mechanisms of resistance to mTOR-inhibitor therapy and describe potential strategies to overcome these for the current agents that target this pathway.	0
18523402	Cell-mediated immune responses to complex and single mycobacterial antigens in tuberculosis patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cell-mediated immune (CMI) response in diabetic and non-diabetic tuberculosis (TB) patients and healthy subjects in response to complex, fractionated and single antigens of Mycobacteriumtuberculosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from patients suffering from pulmonary TB and type II diabetes (n = 7), pulmonary TB without diabetes (n = 10) and healthy subjects without TB and diabetes (n = 10). PBMC were assessed for CMI responses in antigen-induced proliferation assays in response to complex mycobacterial antigens (whole cells, cell walls and culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis), a battery of naturally purified or recombinant produced secreted (ESAT6, MPT59, MPT64 and MTB38) and cytosolic (MTB10, MTB70, ML10, ML28, ML36, ML65 and MB65) mycobacterial antigens and fractionated culture filtrate proteins (fractions F1-F10) of M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: The majority (>70%) of diabetic and non-diabetic TB patients and healthy subjects responded to the complex antigens of M. tuberculosis. However, among the single antigens, ESAT6 was most frequently recognized by TB patients with and without diabetes, but least recognized by healthy subjects. The secreted antigens MPT59 and MPT64 were recognized by all the groups, whereas the cytosolic antigens were recognized best by healthy subjects. When tested with fractionated secreted proteins present in the culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis, the best responses in both diabetic and non-diabetic TB patients were obtained with fractions containing low-molecular-weight proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic and non-diabetic TB patients respond frequently to secreted low-molecular-weight ESAT6 antigen of M. tuberculosis, indicating that this antigen may be useful in the diagnosis of TB in both the groups.	0

18572007	The effects of the size of liposuction cannula on adipocyte survival and the optimum temperature for fat graft storage: an experimental study. BACKGROUND: Determining the most advantageous size of liposuction cannula and injection needles in terms of adipocyte viability could help to increase fat graft survival. When recurrent injections are necessary, storing fat tissue which is harvested during the first operation could be a practical solution if it is stored at an appropriate temperature providing the highest amount of viable fat cells. METHODS: Fat tissue was removed from the abdomen of 10 consecutive female patients by 6-, 4- and 2-mm-diameter liposuction cannulas. Fat tissue harvested with the 6mm cannula was injected through 14, 16 and 20 g needles and collected in separate tubes. An additional three tubes of fat samples were prepared from fat tissue obtained with the 6mm cannula to be stored at +4, -20 and -80 degrees C for 2 weeks. Viability of the fat grafts was evaluated by fat cell isolation with collagenase digestion and staining with supravital dye and counting adipocytes with a haemocytometer. RESULTS: The viability of fat grafts harvested with the 6mm cannula was higher than grafts obtained with smaller cannulas. The viability of fat grafts injected through 14, 16 and 20 g needles were similar to each other. The viability of fat grafts stored at +4 degrees C was similar to fresh tissue whereas freezing fat grafts caused significant loss of viable adipocytes compared to fresh tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The use of larger liposuction cannulas for fat tissue harvesting provides more viable fat grafts. A temperature of +4 degrees C could be proposed as an effective and easily available way of storing fat grafts for at least 2 weeks.	0
6971217	Some functional aspects of the ultrastructure of rat pinealocytes. An analysis of more than 75000 electron micrographs from 84 intact control and 167 experimental male rats divided into 11 groups subjected to various treatments, was performed in the present study, a special attention being paid to the relation of cytoplasmic organelles to the processes of synthesis and secretion of pinealocytes. From these observations the following conclusions have been drawn: 1. specific pineal cells - the pinealocytes - show several attributes of metabolically active endocrine cells; 2. at least two probably intimately related secretory processes are present in the rat pinealocytes; 3. several cytoplasmic structures may be involved in the secretory mechanism of the rat pinealocytes.	0

16454995	Humoral immune responses induced by anti-idiotypic antibody fusion protein of 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF in BALB/c mice. BACKGROUND: We have previously developed and characterized a monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody, designated 6B11, which mimics an ovarian carcinoma associated antigen OC166 - 9 and whose corresponding monoclonal antibody is COC166 - 9 (Ab1). In this study, we evaluate the humoral immune responses induced by the fusion protein 6B11 single-chain variable fragment (scFv)/human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) and 6B11scFv in BALB/c mice. METHODS: The fusion protein 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF was constructed by fusing a recombinant single-chain variable fragment of 6B11scFv to GM-CSF. BALB/c mice were administrated by 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF and 6B11scFv, respectively. RESULTS: The fusion protein 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF retained binding to the anti-mouse F (ab) 2' and was also biologically active as measured by proliferation of human GM-CSF dependent cell TF1 in vitro. After immunization with the 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF and 6B11ScFv, BALB/c mice showed significantly enhanced Ab3 antibody responses to 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF compared with the 6B11scFv alone. The level of Ab3 was the highest after the first week and maintained for five weeks after the last immunization. Another booster was given when the Ab3 titer descended, and it would reach to the high level in a week. CONCLUSION: The fusion protein 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF can induce humoral immunity against ovarian carcinoma in vivo. We also provide the theoretical foundation for the application of the fusion protein 6B11scFv/hGM-CSF for active immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.	0
19907741	Role of ADP-ribosyl cyclase in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders after coronary artery bypass surgery and experimental ischemia. The pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction was evaluated from the viewpoint of cellular disturbances in NAD(+) metabolism and changes in activity of NAD(+)-utilizing enzymes (e.g., ADP-ribosyl cyclase/CD38). S-100B concentration and CD38 expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes were altered in patients after surgery for coronary heart disease with extracorporeal circulation. These changes in patients during the early postoperative period correlated with variations in CD38 expression on neuronal cells from postischemic rats with cognitive dysfunction.	0

7081458	Estimation of local myocardial stress. Two formulas are presented for estimating local average circumferential stress in the left ventricle from the cavity pressure and various quantities, available from the angiogram, which characterize the size and shape of the cavity and ventricular wall. The advantages of these formulas are as follows: 1) they are based on thick-wall shell theory; 2) they are intended for application at positions in the ventricular wall other than the base; and 3) they are based on a more general representation of ventricular geometry than a sphere, cylinder, or ellipsoid. Except for one location, both formulas predict average circumferential stresses that agree to within 25% with the corresponding stresses in a finite element model of an aneurysmal ventricle. In addition, at the equator of a thick-wall ellipsoid, the formulas are identical in form to a previously derived formula that has been shown to predict stresses that are in fair to good agreement with measured stresses in the open-chest dog heart.	0

19283078	Characterization of arterial wave reflection in healthy bonnet macaques: feasibility of applanation tonometry. Nonhuman primates are commonly used in cardiovascular research. Increased arterial stiffness is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and higher CV risk. We determined the augmentation index (AI) using applanation tonometry in 61 healthy monkeys (59% female, age 1-25 years). Technically adequate studies were obtained in all subjects and required 1.5 +/- 1.3 minutes. The brachial artery provided the highest yield (95%). AI was correlated with heart rate (HR) (r = -0.65, P < .001), crown rump length (CRL) (r = 0.42, P = .001), and left ventricular (LV) mass determined using echocardiography (r = 0.52, P < .001). On multivariate analysis, HR (P < .001) and CRL (P = .005) were independent predictors of AI (R2 = 0.46, P < .001). Body Mass Index (BMI) and AI were independent predictors of higher LV mass on multivariate analysis (P < .001 and P = .03). In conclusion, applanation tonometry is feasible for determining AI. Reference values are provided for AI in bonnet macaques, in whom higher AI is related to HR and CRL, and in turn contributes to higher LV mass.	0

17662916	Leptin as a cardiac hypertrophic factor: a potential target for therapeutics. The satiety factor leptin has received extensive attention especially in terms of its potential role in appetite suppression and regulation of energy expenditure. Once considered to be solely derived from adipose tissue, which accounts for the greatly increased levels observed in obese subjects, it is now apparent that leptin can be produced by a multiplicity of tissues, including the heart, where it appears to function in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Plasma leptin concentrations are also elevated in patients with heart disease including those with congestive heart failure. Leptin exerts its biological effects via a family of receptors termed Ob-R. In cardiac cells, one of leptin's primary actions is to produce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through multifaceted cell signaling mechanisms including stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway. The hypertrophic effect of leptin suggests that it may contribute to myocardial remodeling after cardiac injury and offers the potential targeting of the leptin system as a novel cardiac therapy.	0

10217648	Ready-made, recalibrated, or Remodeled? Issues in the use of risk indexes for assessing mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. BACKGROUND: Risk indexes for operative mortality after cardiac surgery are used for comparative profiling of surgeons or centers. We examined whether clinicians and managers should use an existing index without modification, recalibrate it for their populations, or derive a new model altogether. METHODS AND RESULTS: Drawing on 7491 consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG at 2 Toronto teaching hospitals between 1993 and 1996, we compared 3 strategies: (1) using a ready-made model originally derived and validated in our jurisdiction; (2) recalibrating the ready-made model to better fit the population; and (3) deriving a new model with additional risk factors. We assessed statistical accuracy, ie, area under a receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC); precision, ie, statistical goodness-of-fit; and actual impact on both risk-adjusted operative mortalities (RAOM) and performance rankings for 14 surgeons. The new model was slightly more accurate than the ready-made model (ROC, 0.78 versus 0.76; P<0.05), albeit not different from the recalibrated model (ROC, 0.77). The ready-made model showed poor fit between the predicted and observed results (P<0.001), leading to significant underestimation of RAOM (1.6+/-0. 2%) compared with the other strategies (2.5+/-0.2%; P=0.048). Remodeling also changed the performance rankings among half the surgeons with higher RAOM. CONCLUSIONS: Poorly calibrated risk algorithms can bias the calculation of RAOM and alter the results of surgeon-specific profiles. Any existing index used for risk assessment in cardiac surgery should be episodically recalibrated or compared with new models derived from local subjects to ensure that its performance remains optimal.	0
18717822	Functional interactions between anthrax toxin receptors and the WNT signalling protein LRP6. To exert its activity, anthrax toxin must be endocytosed and its enzymatic toxic subunits delivered to the cytoplasm. It has been proposed that, in addition to the anthrax toxin receptors (ATRs), lipoprotein-receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), known for its role in Wnt signalling, is also required for toxin endocytosis. These findings have however been challenged. We show that LRP6 can indeed form a complex with ATRs, and that this interaction plays a role both in Wnt signalling and in anthrax toxin endocytosis. We found that ATRs control the levels of LRP6 in cells, and thus the Wnt signalling capacity. RNAi against ATRs indeed led to a drastic decrease in LRP6 levels and a subsequent drop in Wnt signalling. Conversely, LRP6 plays a role in anthrax toxin endocytosis, but is not essential. We indeed found that toxin binding triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP6, induced its redistribution into detergent-resistant domains, and its subsequent endocytosis. RNAis against LRP6 strongly delayed toxin endocytosis. As the physiological role of ATRs is probably to interact with the extracellular matrix, our findings raise the interesting possibility that, through the ATR-LRP6 interaction, adhesion to the extracellular matrix could locally control Wnt signalling.	0
7781728	Correlation of change in phage type with pulsed field profile and 16S rrn profile in Salmonella enteritidis phage types 4, 7 and 9a. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and 16S rRNA (rrn) analysis (ribotyping), the in vivo derivation of strains of Salmonella enteritidis PTs 9a and 7 from a strain of S. enteritidis PT 4 has been demonstrated. All strains were isolated from a single patient over a 6-week period. Further studies have demonstrated that in terms of pulsed-field profile and ribotype, the genotypes of the patient-derived strains differed from those of the reference strains of the respective phage types. It is concluded that when used in combination, these methods can provide evidence of phylogenetic relationships in apparently unrelated S. enteritidis phage types isolated during pathogenesis of disease.	0
20237174	Standardizing the intensity of upper limb treatment in rehabilitation medicine. OBJECTIVE: To describe a treatment protocol for the upper limb that standardizes intensity of therapy input regardless of the severity of presentation. DESIGN: The protocol is described (Part 1) and feasibility and effect explored (Part 2). SUBJECTS: Participants (n = 11) had a single ischaemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory more than one year previously, and had residual weakness of the hand with some extension present at the wrist and the ability to grasp. INTERVENTIONS: Following two baseline assessments, participants attended therapy for 1 hour a day for 10 consecutive working days. Treatment consisted of a combination of strength and functional task training. Outcomes were measured immediately after training, at one month and three months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Intensity was measured with Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion. Secondary outcome measures included Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), nine-hole peg test, and Goal Attainment Scale. RESULTS: Borg scores indicated that the level of intensity was appropriate and similar across all participants despite individual differences in the severity of their initial presentation (median (interquartile range) = 14 (13-15)). The mean ARAT score significantly increased by 6.8 points (chi(2)(3) = 15.618, P<0.001), and was maintained at three-month follow-up (z = - 2.384, P = 0.016). The nine-hole peg test also showed a main effect of time and 88% of goals set were achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The physiotherapy protocol standardized intensity of treatment by grading exercise and task-related practice according to the person's residual ability, rather than simply standardizing treatment times. It was feasible and well tolerated in this group.	0

11249807	Present and future role of Mental Illness Advocacy Associations in the management of the mentally ill: realities, needs and hopes at the edge of the third millennium. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present review is the analysis of the development and current status of the Mental Illness Advocacy Movement in the USA and in Europe, as well as of the role such a movement is playing in the management of the mentally ill. METHODS: Information on the issue has been collected via literature search and several personal inquiries and contacts with different Mental Illness Advocacy Groups in the USA and in Europe. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the Mental Illness Advocacy Movement is very alive and in full growth. Its role in the management of the mentally ill has become more and more important over the years. In several countries, it makes it possible to overcome some of the deficiencies of the National or Private Health Services. Thanks to the actions of the various Mental Illness Advocacy Groups, today, patients and families are more and better informed of their conditions and their rights. In many cases, this results in earlier diagnosis, better compliance and better outcomes. However, despite significant improvement in the status of the mentally ill patient, much still remains to be done. CONCLUSIONS: We need an improved dialogue with mental heath providers, public administrators, mental health policy makers, mass media and politicians. The dialogue between primary care team and the specialist must also be improved. A global alliance for action is needed to ensure better and more available services to those who suffer from mental disorders.	0

9499100	A new internal ribosomal entry site 5' boundary is required for poliovirus translation initiation in a mouse system. Four mutants of the virulent Mahoney strain of poliovirus were generated by introducing mutations in nucleotides (nt) 128 to 134 of the genome, a region that contains a part of the stem-loop II (SLII) structure located within the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES; nt 120 to 590) (K. Shiroki, T. Ishii, T. Aoki, Y. Ota, W.-X. Yang, T. Komatsu, Y. Ami, M. Arita, S. Abe, S. Hashizume, and A. Nomoto, J. Virol. 71:1-8, 1997). These mutants (SLII mutants) replicated well in human HeLa cells but not in mouse TgSVA cells that had been established from the kidney of a poliovirus-sensitive transgenic mouse. Their neurovirulence in mice was also greatly attenuated compared to that of the parental virus. The poor replication activity of the SLII mutants in TgSVA cells appeared to be attributable to reduced activity of the IRES. Two and three naturally occurring revertants that replicated well in TgSVA cells were isolated from mutants SLII-1 and SLII-5, respectively. The revertants recovered IRES activity in a cell-free translation system from TgSVA cells and returned to a neurovirulent phenotype like that of the Mahoney strain in mice. Two of the revertant sites that affected the phenotype were identified as being at nt 107 and within a region from nt 120 to 161. A mutation at nt 107, specifically a change from uridine to adenine, was observed in all the revertant genomes and exerted a significant effect on the revertant phenotype. Exhibition of the full revertant phenotype required mutations in both regions. These results suggested that nt 107 of poliovirus RNA is involved in structures required for the IRES activity in mouse cells.	0

8334383	Further studies on the primer formation for glycogen biosynthesis in rat heart. Using selected incubation conditions we have identified intermediate steps, between the first glucose transferred to protein and the appropriate substrate for glycogen synthase. Mn2+ stimulates the addition of the first, and probably, the second glucose molecule to the acceptor protein but inhibits further elongation. In the presence of Mn2+ only one radioglucosylated protein band of M(r) 42 kDa was evident. In the absence of Mn2+, two bands of 60.7 and 64.6 kDa were obtained indicating elongation of the glucan chains. After Glc6P addition a family of glucosylated proteins with higher M(r) was obtained, as reported previously. Mn2+ inhibition of the second step, is reversed by PMSF+Glc6P addition. Under these conditions a family of radioglucosylated protein bands with M(r) far in excess of 42 kDa, similar to that obtained without Mn2+, was obtained. Therefore, two different transglucosylating activities were necessary, at least, to prepare the appropriate substrate for glycogen synthase. Based on these observations the model we proposed earlier for glycogen biogenesis is modified. The original \"Glycogen Initiator\" implies at present two enzymatic activities, Glycogen Initiator 1 (activated by Mn2+) and Glycogen Initiator 2 (inhibited by Mn2+).	0

7263276	Enzyme variability in natural populations of Daphnia carinata king. Fifteen populations of the cladoceran crustacean, Daphnia carinata, were examined for allozyme variation at sixteen gene loci. Individuals of this cyclic parthenogen were heterozygous at only 2.1 per cent of their loci. Large differences in gene frequencies existed among the populations. Within populations genotypic frequencies were in good agreement with Hardy-Weinberg expectations, and remained stable during annual cycles of population growth. Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed between the allelic variants at two leucine aminopeptidase loci in certain populations, suggesting that the loci are tightly linked and that populations of D. carinata are founded from few individuals.	0

17023852	Preventive effect of erythropoietin on spinal cord cell apoptosis following acute traumatic injury in rats. STUDY DESIGN: Using a rat spinal cord injury (SCI) model, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), anti-active caspase-3 antibody staining, histological examination, and histochemical studies were used to examine the antiapoptotic effect of erythropoietin. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in detail the antiapoptotic effect of erythropoietin following SCI. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although some investigators have reported antiapoptotic effects of erythropoietin using the TUNEL method, it has not been determined whether erythropoietin can prevent both acute neuronal death and secondary injury. Therefore, we examined the temporal and spatial effects of erythropoietin using TUNEL and active caspase-3 following SCI. METHODS: An in vitro study used a cerebrocortical culture in which the antiapoptotic effect of erythropoietin was examined after N-methyl-D-aspartate treatment. Using an in vivo study, rats with SCI received erythropoietin intraperitoneally, and were examined histologically and immunohistochemically with TUNEL, active caspase-3, and cell markers between 6 hours and 7 days after injury. RESULTS: Cerebrocortical culture confirmed an antiapoptotic effect of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin treatment significantly decreased TUNEL-positive apoptotic neurons and oligodendrocytes as early as 6 hours after SCI in rats. This antiapoptotic effect was observed until 7 days after injury. In addition, erythropoietin treatment significantly decreased the number of active caspase-3 immunoreactive cells within the SCI. In the in vitro study, cerebrocortical culture confirmed an antiapoptotic effect of erythropoietin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that exogenous erythropoietin decreases the number of apoptotic cells observed between the very early and subchronic stages following traumatic SCI.	0
22017552	Moderating effects of three coping strategies and self-esteem on perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms: A minority stress model for Asian international students. This study examined 3 coping strategies (reflective, suppressive, and reactive), along with self-esteem, as moderators of the relation between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms. International students (N = 354) from China, India, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong provided data via an online survey. The role of perceived general stress was statistically controlled. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated a significant direct effect of perceived discrimination, a significant 2-way interaction of perceived discrimination and suppressive coping, and a significant 3-way interaction of perceived discrimination, reactive coping, and self-esteem in predicting depressive symptoms. An increased tendency to use suppressive coping appeared to strengthen the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms. In contrast, the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms was not significant when reactive coping was infrequently used, but only for students with relatively high self-esteem.

7558506	Group supervision: focus on countertransference. This paper examines the advantages of a particular way of supervising psychotherapy, namely, in a group setting with a special focus on the supervisee's countertransference experience. Group supervision is conceptualized as much more than presenting a case and getting feedback. Rather, the group is used in all its interactive complexity as it resonates in a myriad of ways to aspects of the case being presented. Furthermore, because of the complexity of conscious and unconscious interactions and reverberations during this process, it is often helpful to have a focus in the supervision. One helpful possibility is to center on the supervisee's countertransference experience and use the group to reflect, amplify, and process that experience. This can be a highly valuable way of helping the therapists increase their understanding of the case and enhance the quality of therapeutic interventions.	0

16777228	The expression pattern of three mast cell specific proteases during mouse development. Mast cell chymases and tryptases are major constituents of mast cell granules exhibiting an intriguing but potentially confusing variety of forms and functions. Thanks to recent genetic and biochemical advances, a clearer picture of phylogenetic and functional relationships in this large group of mammalian enzymes is emerging. While different in vivo and in vitro studies characterize the function of these proteases in adult tissues, only sparse information is available about these enzymes during embryogenesis. In the present study, we followed the expression patterns of three different mast cell proteases--mcpt5 (chymase), mcpt6 and 7 (tryptases)--during the development of the mouse embryo. Using specific probe sets for Northern blot analysis, nested PCR and in situ hybridization we describe the expression patterns of the three proteases in different stages of the developing embryo. Furthermore, we try to localize the expression pattern of the three proteases to a certain region and subset of cells. Based on the spatial and temporal expression patterns of mcpt5, 6 and 7 we hypothesize that these molecules play specific and distinct roles in the prenatal and postnatal stages.	0
18800630	[Efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis in neurosurgical operations]. OBJECT: It is reported that antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) reduces the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) in neurological surgery. However, a great deal of variation exists regarding the type of antibiotics, dose, timing and duration. In this study, the authors analyzed the incidence of SSI comparing two different AMP protocols. CLINICAL MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred and fifty patients who had undergone neurosurgeries at our institute between April 2005 and August 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. They were divided into the protocol F (309 patients with two or more days AMP) and the protocol P (241 patients with one-day AMP). RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were not statistically different between two protocols. The overall rate of SSI was 1.5%. Although SSI showed a trend of low SSI incidence in the protocol P (0.8%), this was not statistically significant compared with that in the protocol F (1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The one-day (< 24 hours) administration of AMP is enough to prevent SSI in neurological surgery.	0

16325383	Theoretical analysis of adhering lipid vesicles with free edges. A theoretical model for describing the adhesion of lipid vesicle with free edges is developed. For adhesion in contact potential or in finite-range potential, the total energy functional is defined as the sum of elastic free energy, the surface energy, the line tension energy and the contact potential or the long-ranged potential. The equilibrium differential equation and boundary conditions for opening-up lipid vesicles are derived through minimizing the total energy functional. Numerical solutions to these equations are obtained under the axial symmetric condition. These numerical solutions can be used to qualitatively explain the influence of the substrate on the open-up lipid vesicles.	0

16899810	Functional characterization of male germ cell-specific CREM isoforms. Due to alternative promoter usage, splicing, and translational initiation, expression of the cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) gene results in the production of functionally different CREM proteins with either activating or repressing potential on target gene expression. Recently, we demonstrated 2 novel isoforms (CREM-2-F-G-H-Ib and CREM-2-G-H-Ib) in various germ cell types during normal and impaired human spermatogenesis. In contrast to known isoforms, these exhibit a transactivation domain but lack a kinase-inducible domain (KID) domain resulting in a disruption of the open reading frame. In the present study, we functionally analyzed these isoforms. Investigation of both in vitro and in vivo expressed proteins from human testis RNA suggests that a novel upstream open reading frame in exon 2 is translated from isoform CREM-2-F-G-H-Ib, giving rise to a full-length protein. Furthermore, in both isoforms, usage of downstream adeninethymine-guanines (ATGs) for translation initiation could be observed. Sequence-specific DNA binding of CREM isoforms was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Luciferase reporter gene assays in cells transfected with novel CREM cDNAs demonstrated that protein kinase A dependent stimulation was inhibited by coexpression of CREM-2-F-G-H-Ib but not of CREM-2-G-H-Ib.	1
23859703	Preparation and characterization of self-assembled chitosan nanoparticles for the sustained delivery of streptokinase: an in vivo study. Chitosan (CS) nanoparticles have been extensively studied as carriers for therapeutic proteins in recent years. In this study, streptokinase loaded-CS nanoparticles were prepared and the pharmacokinetic parameters of streptokinase were compared with those of naked streptokinase. The preparation method included stirring the protein with the CS solution. The optimized combination was used for animal experiments to determine the streptokinase activity in rat plasma. Blood samples were collected at specified intervals and the activity assay was performed based on amidolysis activity of the chromogenic substrate, S2251, by streptokinase-plasminogen activator complex. The results demonstrated that streptokinase-loaded CS nanoparticles have more prolonged amidolytic activity in vivo compared to the naked one.	0

19609889	Thyroid hormone and coronary artery disease: from clinical correlations to prognostic implications. BACKGROUND: Overt thyroid dysfunction, hypothyroidism in particular, may lead to coronary artery disease (CAD). Whether more subtle anomalies of thyroid hormone metabolism influence the progression of CAD remains a matter of speculation. HYPOTHESIS: The occurrence of CAD and long-term prognosis in patients without a history of either primary thyroid disease, myocardial infarction, or chronic heart failure is related to serum levels of biologically active free triiodothyronine (fT3). METHODS: The cohort consisted of 1047 clinically and biochemically euthyroid patients (median age 65.6 y and 69% male) who underwent coronary angiography in our institute for suspected CAD. RESULTS: Lower fT3 levels were predictive of both single-vessel (p = 0.012) and multivessel (p = 0.009) CAD. Through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fT3 was still linked to the presence of CAD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.68, p < 0.001). After a mean follow-up of 31 months, the survival rate was 95% and total mortality (log-rank 6.75, p = 0.009), as well as cardiac mortality (log-rank 8.26, p = 0.004), was greater among patients with low T3 (fT3 < 2.10 pg/mL) syndrome. At subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis, the association between low T3 syndrome and survival was maintained (total mortality HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.05-3.10, p = 0.034; cardiac mortality HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.13-5.93, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: In this selected population, fT3 levels were inversely correlated to the presence of CAD and low T3 syndrome conferred an adverse prognosis, even after adjusting for traditional coronary risk factors.	0
19405491	Nickelacyclic-cobaltocene vs. nickelacyclic-nickelocene. Synthesis, X-ray structures, electron transfer activity, EPR spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. Reactions of 9-nickelafluorenyllithium with cobalt and nickel pentamethylcyclopentadienyl-acetylacetonates resulted in the formation of the novel nickelacyclic-cobaltocene 2 and nickelacyclic-nickelocene 3, respectively, in which the central metal atom is bonded to the nickelafluorenyl ring. On the basis of their redox propensity, compounds 2 and 3 were oxidized to the corresponding monocations [2](+) and [3](+). The crystal and molecular structures of both the redox couples were determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. In spite of their structural similarity, they display a rather different electron transfer ability. To throw light on such an aspect, the pertinent redox couples have been examined by EPR spectroscopy and the nature of the frontier orbitals involved in the redox activity of the neutral precursors has been supported by extended Huckel theoretical calculations.	0
8294306	Genetic diversity of Helicobacter pylori indexed with respect to clinical symptomatology, using a 16S rRNA and a species-specific DNA probe. DNA probes are described which identify group and fingerprint strains of the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, on the basis of well-defined band homologies. A 544 bp internal fragment of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers derived from the Escherichia coli rRNA gene sequence. In genomic Southern blots this probe detected restriction site variation around these loci, generating simple but strain-specific molecular fingerprints. A small conserved chromosomal fragment of 1.2 kbp, Hps, species-specific for H. pylori, was obtained by cloning random HindIII fragments into pUC19. It was useful for dot-blot identification, and also separated isolates into one major and two minor groups. When results for these two probes were combined, a baseline characterization of genotype was obtained. A band-matching database of molecular fingerprints for the type strain and 63 clinical isolates of H. pylori from asymptomatic, ulcer and gastritis contexts is presented. No significant association between the genotypes at this level of definition and the associated clinical symptomatology of the isolates was detected.	0
7076058	Chromosomal evolution in \"lemurs\". VI. Chromosomal banding studies of Galago senegalensis, Galago alleni, Galago demidovii and Euoticus elegantulus. The karyotype of four Galagidae (Galago senegalensis, G. demidovii, G. alleni and Euoticus elegantulus) are studied and compared with the aid of various banding techniques. Many common chromosome segments were found, and it was possible to reconstruct a hypothetical ancestral karyotype for the family. It was also possible to show the relation between the chromosomes of Galagidae with those of two Lorisidae. The general scheme of chromosomal evolution of the Lorisiforms can be proposed, resulting from a common populational evolution followed by an accumulation of translocations, mostly of the Robertsonian type. Several pericentric inversions have also occurred in the trunk of the Lorisidae, emerging from this common population. Then, Galagidae have evolved, each species independently, by an accumulation of translocations, mostly Robertsonian, whereas Lorisidae have accumulated pericentric inversions prior diverging.	0
12021152	Class II MHC alleles in rheumatoid arthritis in Tamilnadu, India: is there an association? Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was reported to be associated with class II MHC alleles in different ethnic populations. A similar study was undertaken to determine the association of class II MHC with RA patients of Tamilnadu (Tamil-speaking Hindus), India. Thirty patients with RA and 39 healthy controls were included. Polymorphic second exons of the DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 genes were amplified and subjected to SSOP typing. No allele was found to be significantly associated with RA. However DRB1*11 (P = 0.01) and DQB1*0302 (P = 0.02) were significantly associated with rheumatoid factor-positive RA patients. (All the DRB1*11-positive RA patients had either *04 or *10 allele as their second allele. This study is first of its kind in this population.	0
11114890	Reciprocal activation of xenobiotic response genes by nuclear receptors SXR/PXR and CAR. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene products such as CYP3A and CYP2B are essential for the metabolism of steroid hormones and xenochemicals including prescription drugs. Nuclear receptor SXR/PXR (steroid and xenobiotic receptor/pregnenolone X receptor) has been shown both biochemically and genetically to activate CYP3A genes, while similar studies have established constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) as a CYP2B regulator. The response elements in these genes are also distinct, furthering the concept of independent regulation. Unexpectedly, we found that SXR can regulate CYP2B, both in cultured cells and in transgenic mice via adaptive recognition of the phenobarbital response element (PBRE). In a type of functional symmetry, orphan receptor CAR was also found to activate CYP3A through previously defined SXR/PXR response elements. These observations not only provide a rational explanation for the activation of multiple CYP gene classes by certain xenobiotics, but also reveal the existence of a metabolic safety net that confers a second layer of protection to the harmful effects of toxic compounds and at the same time increases the propensity for drug-drug interactions.	1
22067957	Diacylglycerol kinase   : at the crossroads of lipid signaling and protein complex organization. Diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are lipids with unique functions as metabolic intermediates, basic membrane constituents, and second-signal components. Diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) regulate the levels of these two lipids, catalyzing the interconversion of one to the other. The DGK family of enzymes is composed of 10 isoforms, grouped into five subfamilies based on the presence of distinct regulatory domains. From its initial characterization as a type IV DGK to the generation of mouse models showing its importance in cardiac dysfunction and immune pathologies, diacylglycerol kinase    (DGK  ) has proved an excellent example of the critical role of lipid-metabolizing enzymes in the control of cell responses. Although the mechanism that regulates this enzyme is not well known, many studies demonstrate its subtle regulation and its strategic function in specific signaling and as part of adaptor protein complexes. These data suggest that DGK   offers new opportunities for therapeutic manipulation of lipid metabolism.	0
9026280	[Ovarian stimulation using a protocol of low dose agonist in patients with an elevated basal FSH]. This study compare the ovarian response of patients with high day 3 FSH (> 6.5 UI/L), treated with two protocols; a protocol with a low dose of GnRH agonist and a so called \"long protocol\" with GnRH agonist in a depot formula. The ovarian response with the agonist low dose was better with less ampules (37.1 vs 46.6) and a shorter duration of stimulation (10.5 vs 12.4 days). The number of mature oocyte was higher (5.9 vs 4.5) as well as the number of good quality embryo (3.2 versus 2.3). The E2 levels on day 8 was higher (1065 vs 460 pg/ml). The cancellation rate was lower (14% vs 26%). The use of the low dose protocol gave a better ovarian response for patients with high 3 FSH. Large randomized studies are needed to confirm these data.	0

9673717	Increased bone mineral turnover without increased glucose utilization in sclerotic and hyperplastic change in fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone disorder. It is diagnosed by distinctive X-ray radiography, CT, and MRI findings. Although bone scintigraphy helps to identify the tumor origin according to accelerated bone turnover, the glucose metabolism in fibrous dysplasia has not yet been investigated. We reported a case of fibrous dysplasia in craniofacial bone which showed signs of the acceleration of bone mineral turnover without elevated glucose utilization by Technetium-99m-HMDP SPECT and Fluorine-18-FDG PET. We concluded that the growth of fibrous dysplasia needed the acceleration of bone mineral turnover without an increase in glucose metabolism.	0
22076958	CD133 and CD44 are universally overexpressed in GIST and do not represent cancer stem cell markers. Although imatinib mesylate has been a major breakthrough in the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), complete responses are rare and most patients eventually develop resistance to the drug. Thus, the possibility of an imatinib-insensitive cell subpopulation within GIST tumors, harboring stem cell characteristics, may be responsible for the clinical failures. However, the existence of a cancer stem cell component in GIST has not been yet established. This study was aimed to determine whether expression of commonly used stem cell markers in other malignancies, that is, CD133 and CD44, might identify cells with characteristics of cancer stem/progenitor cells in human GIST. CD133 and CD44 expression in GIST explants was analyzed by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and gene expression. Their transcription levels were correlated with clinical and molecular factors in a large, well-annotated cohort of GIST patients. FACS sorted GIST cells based on CD133 and CD44 expression were isolated and used to assess phenotypic characteristics, ability to maintain their surface expression, sensitivity to imatinib, and expression signature. The enrichment in CD133/CD44 cells in the side population (SP) assay was also investigated. CD133 expression was consistently found in GIST. CD133(-) cells formed more colonies, were more invasive in a matrigel assay, and showed enrichment in the SP cells, compared to CD133(+) cells. CD133 expression was also detected in the two imatinib-sensitive GIST cell lines, while was absent in the imatinib-resistant lines. Our results show that CD133 and CD44 are universally expressed in GIST, and may represent a lineage rather than a cancer stem cell marker.	0

9635914	Clinical strategies for serious infection: a North American perspective. In the United States, as in Europe, clinical strategies for serious infection are being increasingly driven by growing numbers of cephalosporin-resistant and multiresistant gram-negative bacilli. In a survey of nearly 400 hospital intensive care units in North America, resistance rates of Klebsiella to third-generation cephalosporins increased (from 3.6 to 14.4%) between 1990 and 1993. Resistance rates in Enterobacter are even higher, approaching 40%. Much of this resistance, which is due mainly to production of type-1 and extended spectrum beta-lactamases, appears to have arisen through overuse of third-generation cephalosporins and from poor hand-washing practices. In some American cities, a major reservoir of resistant organisms are nursing homes, where there is evidence of overuse of oral antibiotics. Currently, the most reliable agents available for the treatment of resistant gram-negative pathogens are the carbapenems, imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem, and the aminoglycoside, amikacin. A recent clinical study of meropenem monotherapy in patients with nosocomial pneumonia showed statistically significantly better clinical and microbiologic outcome compared with a standard regimen of ceftazidime plus tobramycin. The enhanced in vitro activity of meropenem against a number of key organisms may have been responsible for the superior results. Although the newer cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome, show greater stability to chromosomal type-1 beta-lactamases than ceftazidime, they have variable activity against extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers and can be rendered ineffective by permeability changes which occur in certain organisms. Carbapenems, on the other hand, possess good activity against virtually all of the pathogens which produce the clinically important beta-lactamases, and represent a reliable option for treatment.	0
20136364	Errors and reproducibility of DNA array-based detection of allelic variants in ADME genes: PHARMAchip. AIMS: Differences in adverse drug reactions can be explained by genetic variations, especially if they determine the expression of certain protein effectors and/or drug-metabolizing enzymes. Over the last decade, several tests screening for the most frequent polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes have been marketed for research and diagnostic purposes. The aim of this study was to assess the suitability of PHARMAchip for the genotyping of polymorphisms of genes associated with drug metabolism and response as an alternative to Jurilab Ltd's DrugMEt Test. MATERIALS _ METHODS: In this observational study, performed using 100 previously genotyped DNA samples, we report on common genes included in the two different tests examined: the former DrugMEt test and the recently introduced PHARMAchip test. RESULTS _ CONCLUSION: Although these tests are based on different methodological approaches, we have found a high concordance of results between both methods. Some of the discrepancies between tests were related to allelic variants not monitored in a particular microarray and the quality of the genomic DNA used.	0
24364986	Participation restrictions in patients with psychiatric and/or cognitive disabilities: preliminary results for an ICF-derived assessment tool. Participation in community life is a major challenge for most people with psychiatric and/or cognitive disabilities. Current assessments of participation lack a theoretical basis. However, the new International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a relevant framework. AIMS: The present study used an ICF-derived assessment tool to activity limitations and participation restrictions in two groups of participants with disabilities linked to schizophrenia or traumatic brain injury respectively. METHODS: Twenty-six items (related to six ICF sections) were selected by reviewing the literature and gathering the clinician's opinions and representatives of patient associations. These items, yielded an ordinal rating of activity limitations, participation restrictions and contextual factors (social support, attitudes and, systems _ politics). Special attention was paid to contextual and environmental factors. The final checklist (called the Grid for Measurements of Activity and Participation, G-MAP) was administered to 16 participants with traumatic brain injury (the TBI group) and 15 participants with schizophrenic disorders (the SD group). Psychometric assessments of cognition and, neurobehavioural, psychological and psychosocial functioning were also performed. RESULTS: The internal consistencies for activity limitations (Cronbach's alpha coefficient=0.89) and participation restriction (Cronbach's alpha coefficient=0.89) were satisfactory. We did not observe any significant differences between the two groups in terms of the psychometric test results. The G-MAP scores demonstrated that the two groups were confronted with the same limitations in self care, domestic life, leisure and community life (i.e., the intergroup differences were not statistically significant in Mann-Whitney tests). However, interpersonal relationships and economic and social productivity appeared to be more severely limited in the SD group than in the TBI group. Similarly, participation restrictions in domestic life, interpersonal relationships and economic and social productivity were more severe in the SD group than in the TBI group. CONCLUSION: G-MAP is a useful, feasible, relevant tool for performing a detailed, individualized assessment of participation restrictions in people with psychiatric and/or cognitive disabilities.	0
15988749	Surface-binding autoantibodies to cerebellar neurons in opsoclonus syndrome. Childhood opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome can occur with or without associated neuroblastoma. An autoimmune pathogenesis has been discussed for both forms. We show here that the majority of children with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (10/14) have autoantibodies binding to the surface of isolated rat cerebellar granular neurons. In some patients, these antibodies are masked by IgG binding to ubiquitous surface antigens, which could be removed by preincubation with the nonneuronal control cell line HEK 293. A newly introduced competitive binding assay showed that the surface binding is directed against the same autoantigen in different patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome may be the result of an autoimmune process against a neuronal surface protein.	0

19364086	Frontal sinus fractures: a review of 132 cases. BACKGROUND: Frontal sinus fractures peculiarity is that a wrong treatment not only could it encompass functional or aesthetical problems but also more dangerous complications: the proximity of the frontal bone to the brain, on a side, and to the nasolacrimal duct, on the other side, and therefore to the nasal cavity, lead the traumatisms occurring within this region to be at high risk of infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report our experience on 132 cases of frontal sinus fracture treated from 1989 to 2005 and to present the surgical techniques performed as well as to compare the complications they reported over time to the International Literature data. 101 patients (76.5%) were treated in order to reduce and contain the isolated fractures involving the frontal sinus anterior wall, the patients presenting associated fractures of the frontal sinus anterior and posterior wall were 28 (21.2%), while the cases reporting isolated fractures of the nasolacrimal duct were 3. RESULTS: Our patients underwent follow-ups from 1 to 16 years long. We subdivided the complications found in our group into infectious and functional so that the incidence of the complications related to the sites and the treatment performed according to the specific case could be better assessed. In conclusion, the infectious and functional complications found were treated with a multidisciplinary study considering the approach to the craniofacial traumatized person is subordinated to the co-existence of general and neurological conditions requiring for their resolution different approaches and times.	0
8051234	Rapid, single-step differentiation of equid herpesviruses 1 and 4 from clinical material using the polymerase chain reaction and virus-specific primers. Sets of primers were designed which enabled specific amplification of homologous regions of the glycoprotein C and gene 76 genetic loci of equine herpesviruses 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4). The resultant virus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products arising from each loci could be discriminated easily on the basis of size on an agarose gel, allowing rapid differentiation of the two equine herpesviruses. Specificity of the amplifications were confirmed by Southern hybridization and restriction endonuclease digestion. The PCR test was applied to nasal swab samples from weanling foals and to archival aborted fetal tissue samples and the results compared to those obtained by virus isolation. A strong correlation was found between this PCR assay and virus isolation methods of EHV-1 and EHV-4 detection and discrimination.	0

10962646	Can absolute oral bioavailability in humans be predicted from animals? A comparison of allometry and different indirect methods. The objective of this study was to predict absolute bioavailability in humans from animal data using interspecies scaling as well as indirect approaches. Five different methods were used to predict absolute bioavailability in humans: (i) absolute bioavailability vs body weight (allometric approach); (ii) F = CL(IV)/CL(oral); (iii) F = 1-[CL(IV)/Q]; (iv) F = 1-[CL(oral)/Q]; and (v) F = Q/[Q + CL(oral)]. Methods II-V are indirect approaches, where predicted i.v. or oral clearance and hepatic blood flow (Q) (1500 ml/min) were used to predict absolute bioavailability in humans. Fifteen drugs were tested and the results of this study indicate that all five approaches predict absolute bioavailability with different degrees of accuracy, and are therefore unreliable for the accurate prediction of absolute bioavailability in humans from animal data. In conclusion, although the above-mentioned approaches do not accurately predict absolute bioavailability, a rough estimate of absolute bioavailability is possible using these approaches.	0
12506845	Securing staff salary adjustments and raises. Salary issues have plagued laboratories for as long as there has been a labor shortage, and the situation grows more complicated. At the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS) in Richmond, Virginia, competition for laboratory staff now comes not only from area hospitals and health-care companies but also from non-health-care industries. Shorter shifts, less stress, and better hourly wages offered by fast food chains and retail stores lure away the young workers traditionally hired for entry-level laboratory positions. Clearly, a salary adjustment is necessary.	0
22235374	Patients prefer boarding in inpatient hallways: correlation with the national emergency department overcrowding score. Objective. The boarding of patients in Emergency Department (ED) hallways when no inpatient beds are available is a major cause of ED crowding. One solution is to board admitted patients in an inpatient rather than ED hallway. We surveyed patients to determine their preference and correlated their responses to real-time National Emergency Department Overcrowding Score (NEDOCS). Methods. This was a survey of admitted patients in the ED of an urban university level I trauma center serving a community of 5 million about their personal preferences regarding boarding. Real-time NEDOCS was calculated at the time each survey was conducted. Results. 99 total surveys were completed during October 2010, 42 (42%) patients preferred to be boarded in an inpatient hallway, 33 (33%) preferred the ED hallway, and 24 (24%) had no preference. Mean (  SD) NEDOCS (range 0-200) was 136    46 for patients preferring inpatient boarding, 112    39 for ED boarding, and 119    43 without preference. Male patients preferred inpatient hallway boarding significantly more than females. Preference for inpatient boarding was associated with a significantly higher NEDOCS. Conclusions. In this survey study, patients prefer inpatient hallway boarding when the hospital is at or above capacity. Males prefer inpatient hallway boarding more than females. The preference for inpatient hallway boarding increases as the ED becomes more crowded.	0
10378871	Antigen presenting capacity of brain microvasculature in altered peptide ligand modulation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Co-immunization with an altered peptide ligand (LR) partially protects SJL mice from proteolipid protein peptide 139-151-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis [Kuchroo, V.K., Greer, J.M., Kaul, D., Ishioka, G.Y., Franco, A., Sette, A., Sobel, R.A., Lees, M.B., 1994. A single TCR antagonist peptide inhibits experimental allergic encephalomyelitis mediated by a diverse T cell repertoire. J. Immunol. 153, 3326-3336; Santambrogio, L., Lees, M.B., Sobel, R.A., 1998. Altered peptide ligand modulation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis: immune responses within the CNS. J. Neuroimmunol. 81, 1-13]. Clinical protection was noted despite extensive central nervous system inflammation observed after co-immunization with native and altered peptides. To extend our previous reports on this model, we now compare MHC class II expression and antigen presenting cell activity of cells associated with the blood-brain barrier in diseased and protected mice. Immunohistochemical studies identified MHC class II products on both the endothelial and microglial/macrophage populations. Ex vivo experiments suggested a correlation between the reduced clinical disease observed in the co-immunized mice and the antigen presenting activity of cells at the blood-brain barrier. The results suggest that antigen presenting activity is primarily mediated by macrophage-lineage cells of the central nervous system.	0

20882877	Prognostic significance of topoisomerase II alpha and collagen IV immunoexpression in cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: The immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of topoisomerase II alpha and collagen IV was studied in cervical cancer. The results of IHC expression for both markers were compared to the clinical and histological factors predicting the course of disease. METHODS: In 114 patients with cervical cancer, treated at the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Medical Centre Ljubljana between 1995 and 1999, the tumor tissue was analyzed using standard IHC staining (IHS) procedures for topoisomerase II alpha and collagen IV. The obtained results were compared to those obtained by clinical, pathomorphological and morphometric prognostic factors, and the impact of the analyzed factors on the outcome of disease was assessed. RESULTS: A high percentage of IHC expression of topoisomerase II alpha was present in 55.3%, and to collagen IV in 28.1% of cervical cancer patients. In the multivariate analysis the IHS intensity to collagen IV was significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion (OR = 5.906; 95% CI 2.18-15.96). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a statistically significantly better survival in initial cervical cancer stages (p = 0.001), in tumors with a higher degree of differentiation (p = 0.049), more shallow depth of invasion (p = 0.004), smaller horizontal tumor spread (p = 0.001), in cases with no lymph node metastases (p = 0.001) and no lymphovascular space invasion (p = 0.001), in younger age groups (p = 0.001) and in women with regular menstrual cycles (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: IHC expression of topoisomerase II alpha and collagen IV was significantly correlated with defense reaction. A negative and weak IHC to collagen IV was a statistically significant independent predictive variable for lymphovascular invasion, related to metastatic spread in the lymph nodes. The two analyzed IHC markers indicate the existence of factors at the molecular level that might complement the assessment of cervical cancer prognosis, resulting in the appropriate choice of type and extent of treatment.	0
9758326	Another report of adverse reactions to immediate-release nifedipine. Numerous case reports in the literature describe adverse drug events associated with immediate-release nifedipine (IRN). In addition, several publications alerted health care professionals regarding the agent. However, it is still administered, and adverse reactions are still reported. Our patient suffered IRN-induced hypotension, myocardial ischemia, and mental status changes. We recommend that the use of IRN in treatment of hypertension should be either totally prohibited or severely restricted. The product should not be readily available for indiscriminate administration. Also, continuing education and training are required to alert all health care professionals to the serious dangers associated with this drug.	0
9735341	Nitric oxide response to shear stress by human bone cell cultures is endothelial nitric oxide synthase dependent. Bone cells, in particular osteocytes, are extremely sensitive to shear stress, a phenomenon that may be related to mechanical adaptation of bone. In this study we examined whether human primary bone cells produce NO in response to fluid shear stress and established by RT/PCR which NOS isoforms were expressed before and after application of shear stress. One hour pulsating fluid flow (PFF; 0.7 +/- 0.02 Pa, 5 Hz) caused a rapid (within 5 min) 2 to 4-fold increase in NO production. NO release was only transiently increased during the first 15 min of exposure to PFF, and remained at control levels during a 1-24 hr postincubation period. In both control and PFF-treated cells, mRNA was easily detected for ecNOS, but not nNOS, and only minimal amounts iNOS were found. mRNA levels for ecNOS increased 2-fold at 1 hr after 1 hr PFF treatment. These results suggest that the rapid production of NO by human bone cells in response to fluid flow results from activation of ecNOS. PFF also leads to an increase in ecNOS mRNA which is likely related to the shear stress responsive element in the promoter of ecNOS.	0
12608011	Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the novel muscarinic receptor agonist SNI-2011 in rats and dogs. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of SNI-2011 ((+/-)-cis-2-methylspiro[1,3-oxathiolane-5,3'-quinuclidine]monohydrochloride hemihydrate, cevimeline, CAS 153504-70-2), a novel muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist developed for the treatment of Sj  gren's syndrome, in rats and dogs were determined following intravenous or oral administration using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The in vitro metabolism of SNI-2011 was also evaluated with rat and dog liver microsomes. After oral administration, plasma concentrations of SNI-2011 reached to Cmax within 1 h in both species, suggesting that SNI-2011 was quickly absorbed, and then decreased with a t1/2 of 0.4-1.1 h. The bioavailability was approximately 50% and 30% in rats and dogs, respectively. Major metabolites in plasma were both S- and N-oxidized metabolites in rats and only N-oxidized metabolite in dogs, indicating that a large species difference was observed in the metabolism of SNI-2011. Sex difference was also observed in the pharmacokinetics of SNI-2011 in rats, but not in dogs. In the in vitro study, chemical inhibition and pH-dependent studies revealed that the sulf-oxidation and N-oxidation of SNI-2011 were mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), respectively, in both species. In addition, CYP2D and CYP3A were mainly responsible for the sulfoxidation in rat liver microsomes.	0

18001350	Differential Flo8p-dependent regulation of FLO1 and FLO11 for cell-cell and cell-substrate adherence of S. cerevisiae S288c. Cell-cell and cell-surface adherence represents initial steps in forming multicellular aggregates or in establishing cell-surface interactions. The commonly used Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strain S288c carries a flo8 mutation, and is only able to express the flocculin-encoding genes FLO1 and FLO11, when FLO8 is restored. We show here that the two flocculin genes exhibit differences in regulation to execute distinct functions under various environmental conditions. In contrast to the laboratory strain Sigma1278b, haploids of the S288c genetic background require FLO1 for cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, whereas FLO11 is required for pseudohyphae formation of diploids. In contrast to FLO11, FLO1 repression requires the Sin4p mediator tail component, but is independent of the repressor Sfl1p. FLO1 regulation also differs from FLO11, because it requires neither the KSS1 MAP kinase cascade nor the pathways which lead to the transcription factors Gcn4p or Msn1p. The protein kinase A pathway and the transcription factors Flo8p and Mss11p are the major regulators for FLO1 expression. Therefore, S. cerevisiae is prepared to simultaneously express two genes of its otherwise silenced FLO reservoir resulting in an appropriate cellular surface for different environments.	0
16829229	Effect of oxidative stress on dynamics of mitochondrial reticulum. Fission of the mitochondrial reticulum (the thread-grain transition) and following gathering of mitochondria in the perinuclear area are induced by oxidative stress. It is shown that inhibitors of the respiratory chain (piericidin and myxothiazol) cause fission of mitochondria in HeLa cells and fibroblasts, whereas a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant (MitoQ) inhibits this effect. Hydrogen peroxide also induced the fission, which was stimulated by the inhibitors of respiration and suppressed by MitoQ. In untreated cells, the mitochondrial reticulum consisted of numerous electrically-independent fragments. Prolonged treatment with MitoQ resulted in drastic increase in size and decrease in number of these fragments. Local photodamage of mitochondria caused immediate depolarization of a large fraction of the mitochondrial network in MitoQ-treated cells. Our data indicate that the thread-grain transition of mitochondria depends on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in initial segments of the respiratory chain and is a necessary step in the process of elimination of mitochondria (mitoptosis).	0

23011251	Brief report: comparability of DSM-IV and DSM-5 ASD research samples. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria for ASD have been criticized for being too restrictive, especially for more cognitively-able individuals. It is unclear, however, if high-functioning individuals deemed eligible for research via standardized diagnostic assessments would meet DSM-5 criteria. This study investigated the impact of DSM-5 on the diagnostic status of 498 high-functioning participants with ASD research diagnoses. The percent of participants satisfying all DSM-5-requirements varied significantly with reliance on data from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; 33  %) versus Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R; 83  %), highlighting the impact of diagnostic methodology on ability to document DSM-5 symptoms. Utilizing combined ADOS/ADI-R data, 93  % of participants met DSM-5 criteria, which suggests likely continuity between DSM-IV and DSM-5 research samples characterized with these instruments in combination.	0

In 3 patients with varicocele a pressure difference was found between the left renal vein and inferior vena cava. No pressure difference was found between the right renal vein and inferior vena cava in these same patients. In a control group of 5 patients right and left renal veins and inferior vena cava pressures closely approximated each other. These preliminary findings are discussed and found to be in disagreement with current concepts of the pathogenesis of varicocele.	0
16411791	The effects of fundamental frequency level on voice onset time in normal adult male speakers. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of fundamental frequency (F(0)) on stop consonant voice onset time (VOT). VOT was measured from the recordings of 56 young men reading phrases containing all 6 English voiced and voiceless stops in word-initial position across high-, medium-, and low-F(0) levels. Separate analyses of variance for the voiced and voiceless stops revealed no significant main effect for F(0) for the voiced stops but a significant F(0) effect for the voiceless stops. Across the voiceless stops, productions at high F(0)s displayed significantly shorter VOTs than productions at low or mid F(0)s. The findings indicated that researchers must take into account the F(0) level at which voiceless stop VOT is measured.	0
15209271	Sampling measurement of soft-x-ray-pulse shapes by femtosecond sequential ionization of Kr+ in an intense laser field. We propose a sampling technique for measuring the shape of ultrashort soft-x-ray pulses. The technique uses the transient state of Kr+ ions that is produced by the femtosecond sequential evolution of Kr ions during optical-field-induced ionization as an ultrafast x-ray-absorption sampling gate. We demonstrate the technique by measuring the pulse shape of the 51st harmonic (15.6 nm) generated by a 100-fs titanium:sapphire laser pulse. The measured pulse duration is 220 fs. Our experimental result confirms that the sequential evolution of Kr+ ions from neutral Kr to Kr2+ is the dominant contribution to the ionization process from the aspect of time-domain measurement.	0
16148965	Health plan decision making in the Medicare population: results from a national randomized experiment. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of providing the Medicare _ You handbook on consumers' attitudes and behavior regarding health plan decision making. DATA SOURCE: A national sample of 3,738 Medicare beneficiaries who were surveyed in late 1999 and early 2000 was employed. Data were collected using a mail survey with telephone follow-up; the response rate was 76 percent. STUDY DESIGN: Medicare beneficiaries were randomly assigned to a control group that received no Medicare-related in formation as part of the study, or to a treatment group that received a copy of the 2000 version of the Medicare _ You handbook as part of a national mailing. Half of the treat men t group (the \"re-mail\" group) received a second copy of the handbook along wit h their mail survey instrument. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The control and treatment groups did not differ regarding their level of satisfaction with or confidence in their current choice of health plan according to predicted mean values. Treatment group beneficiaries had a significantly higher propensity to either change or consider changing health plans relative to beneficiaries in the control group. Controlling for other factors, 5 percent of treatment group members switched health insurance plans during the prior month compared to 3 percent of control group members. there were no significant differences in predicted values between the re-mail and no re-mail groups in any of the models. Type of supplemental insurance was also highly related to all three outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this and a prior parallel study suggest th at messages contained in the Medicare _ You handbook can have an influence on beneficiaries and the Medicare market . Thus, careful attention should be given to the wording and intent of these messages. This is particularly relevant given the current administration's emphasis on increasing enrollment in Medicare+Choice plans and findings from earlier research reporting that beneficiaries felt the handbook was pressuring them to enroll in managed care.	0

10204770	A photothrombotic ring stroke model in rats with remarkable morphological tissue recovery in the region at risk. The photothrombotic ring stroke model with sustained underperfusion followed by late spontaneous reperfusion (Gu et al. 1999) was employed to study its morphological consequences. The exposed crania of adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a ring-shaped laser irradiation beam simultaneously with intravenous erythrosin B infusion. The ischemic volume was calculated from serial sections throughout the ischemic lesions at 4, 10, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days and 28 days after irradiation. The ischemic volume, expressed as a percentage of the ipsilateral hemispheric volume, increased steadily from 4 to 10 to 24 h to reach its maximum value at 48 h after irradiation; at 3 days, 7 days, and 28 days, the ischemic volume was reduced to 75%, 24%, and 22% of the value at 48 h. Evaluation of ischemic volumes at different anteroposterior levels revealed that the reduced ischemic volume at 72 h and later was mainly due to morphological restoration in the centrally located, nonirradiated region at risk. An initial enlargement and development of cystic coagulation necrosis was observed in the cortical areas corresponding to the ring lesion itself. In the region at risk, a gradually deteriorating neuropil and nerve cell morphology were observed over time, with maximum severity at 48 h postirradiation. At this time, most laminae II and III neurons in the region at risk exhibited eosinophilia and pyknosis but no incrustations, with small islands of less damaged neurons randomly scattered. At 72 h and up to 28 days after irradiation, these cell characteristics were no longer observed and the region at risk was well populated with neurons that had a chiefly unremarkable cytological appearance. Neuronal counts in the central part of the region at risk were performed; no significant difference in neuronal density was observed between sham-operated controls and at 28 days after irradiation. In conclusion, the consistent, late spontaneous reperfusion coincided with remarkable tissue recovery as assessed morphologically in the region at risk. The data suggest that nerve cell repair may occur even after the detection, by conventional morphological methods, of prolonged critical ischemic neuronal damage in the setting of acute ischemic stroke.	0

7859136	The role of atovaquone tablets in treating Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. At the start of the AIDS epidemic, the only agents licensed for treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and pentamidine. Both are effective against PCP, but their use has been compromised by adverse reactions that necessitate discontinuing therapy in < or = 54% of patients. As a result of the limitations in the use of these therapies, research efforts have been directed toward the development of effective agents with an improved safety profile. Of these agents, one of the best studied is atovaquone, a hydroxynaphthoquinone that has been licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of mild to moderate PCP in patients intolerant to TMP-SMX. Clinical studies have shown that atovaquone is associated with overall therapeutic success rates equivalent to those of intravenous pentamidine and TMP-SMX, although its therapeutic efficacy rates are somewhat lower. However, atovaquone is associated with fewer treatment-limiting side effects than the other drugs. The literature concerning the efficacy and safety of atovaquone for the treatment of PCP will be reviewed.	0

9187669	Chromosome segregation in a man heterozygous for a pericentric inversion, inv(9)(p11q13), analyzed by using sperm karyotyping and two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization on sperm nuclei. Analysis of sperm karyotypes and two-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on sperm nuclei were carried out in a man heterozygous for the pericentric inversion inv(9)(p11q13). Sperm chromosome complements were obtained after in vitro fusion of zona-free hamster oocytes and donor sperm. A total of 314 sperm complements was analyzed: 153 (48.7%) carried the inverted chromosome 9 and 161 (51.3%) carried the normal one. None of the sperm complements contained a recombinant chromosome 9, suggesting that no chiasmata were formed in the heterochromatic region. The frequency of structural chromosome aberrations unrelated to the inversion (8.3%) and the frequency of conservative aneuploidy (3.2%) were within the limits observed in our control donors. The proportions of X-bearing (47.3%) and Y-bearing sperm (52.7%) were not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio. The percentage of disomy for chromosome 21 was analyzed by two-color FISH in 10336 sperm nuclei. The disomy rate for chromosome 21 (0.30%) was not significantly different from that found in our controls. These results suggest that the risk for this man of producing chromosomally abnormal offspring or spontaneous abortions was not increased, and do not support the existence of an interchromosomal effect for chromosome 21.	0
24062556	Detection and characterization of Bonamia ostreae in Ostrea edulis imported to China. The protozoan parasite Bonamia ostreae is a destructive pathogen of flat oysters and has been reported to be widespread in Europe and North America. The biological characteristics of this unicellular parasite are still not fully understood. In this study, 104 Ostrea edulis imported from the USA to the Guangdong province of China for consumption were examined for Bonamia infection. PCR assay, combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism, sequencing and BLAST analysis, showed that B. ostreae DNA could be detected in 1 of the 104 oyster samples. Light microscopy revealed Bonamia-like organisms in the oyster. PCR assay and fluorescent in situ hybridization showed that B. ostreae organisms were present and retained their integrity after 4 wk in culture. Acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining indicated that the B. ostreae were still alive. In conclusion, B. ostreae was present in oysters imported to China. More importantly, the parasite was able to survive for at least 4 wk of in vitro culture at 4  C, which further implied a long-term transmission risk of B. ostreae. Considering the wide culture beds of Crassostrea ariakensis and C. gigas in China, and that C. ariakensis and C. gigas are susceptible hosts or reservoirs of B. ostreae, our study highlights the potential risk of introducing B. ostreae by importing O. edulis from a Bonamia endemic area.	0
19661116	Impact of renal dysfunction on appropriate therapy in implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy. AIMS: To examine the effect of renal dysfunction on the occurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects were 274 consecutive patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy who received ICD implantation. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the modification of diet in renal disease formula. Renal dysfunction was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Differences in survival, appropriate ICD therapy and electrical storm in patients with and without renal dysfunction were compared. The effect of worsening renal function (decrease of eGFR of at least 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) within 1 year) on appropriate ICD therapy was also evaluated. There was a higher incidence of appropriate ICD therapy in patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) than in those with eGFR >or=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P = 0.0001). Patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) also showed a significantly higher rate of electrical storm (P = 0.003). Renal dysfunction with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was an independent predictor of appropriate ICD therapy (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.24-2.77, P = 0.003). Patients with worsening renal function within 1 year after implantation were at increased risk for appropriate ICD therapy (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.39-4.52, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that renal dysfunction is an independent risk factor for occurrence of life-threatening arrhythmia even in high-risk patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.	0
20532931	Severe psychosocial stress and heavy cigarette smoking during pregnancy: an examination of the pre- and perinatal risk factors associated with ADHD and Tourette syndrome. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently diagnosed in children with Tourette syndrome (TS). The basis for this co-occurrence is uncertain. This study aimed to determine if specific pre- and perinatal risk factors, including heavy maternal smoking and severe psychosocial stress during pregnancy, were associated with one or both disorders, or neither. We compared maternal report data on pre- and perinatal risk factors on 222 children between the ages of 7 and 18 years including 45 individuals with TS alone, 52 individuals with ADHD alone, 60 individuals with condition of comorbid TS + ADHD, and 65 unaffected control children. Pre- and perinatal histories as well as psychiatric assessments were performed using standardized questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with the mothers and children. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratio for each variable of interest. Compared to the mothers of unaffected control children, the mothers of children with ADHD alone reported higher rates of heavy smoking (>10 cigarettes per day) during pregnancy and higher levels of severe psychosocial stress during pregnancy (OR = 13.5, p < 0.01 and OR = 6.8, p < 0.002, respectively). The TS + ADHD and the TS alone patients also had higher rates heavy maternal smoking and high levels of psychosocial stress compared to the control children, but these differences failed to reach statistical significance (heavy smoking: OR = 8.5, p < 0.052, OR = 4.6, p < 0.19, respectively; severe psychosocial stress: OR = 3.1, p < 0.07, OR = 2.6, p < 0.11, respectively). Heavy maternal smoking and severe levels psychosocial stress during pregnancy were independently associated with a diagnosis of ADHD. TS patients also had higher rates of these risk factors, but the ORs failed to reach statistical significance. Efforts are needed to reduce the frequency of these risk factors in high-risk populations. Future studies, using genetically sensitive designs, are also needed to sort out the causal pathways.	0
16283978	Minimally invasive saphenous vein harvesting using a laryngoscope: procedural, functional, and morphologic evaluation. BACKGROUND: Because commercial minimally invasive harvesting equipments significantly increase operation costs, they are not always available in all clinics worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate whether minimally invasive saphenous vein harvesting using a laryngoscope can be applied efficiently and successfully. METHODS: Thirty patients were prospectively randomized into two groups. One group underwent a minimally invasive technique using a laryngoscope; the other, open saphenous vein harvest. A modified bridging technique, in which tissue retraction and illumination is achieved with a sterilized laryngoscope, was used for minimally invasive harvesting. Smooth muscle contractile and endothelial functions were tested in vitro using an organ chamber. Morphology was examined with light microscopy. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in harvest times or length of the vein harvested by either of the above mentioned techniques. Total length of the incision in the minimally invasive group was significantly shorter than that in the open group. In follow-ups, no significant complications occurred in either group. Pain and leg edema were significantly less in the minimally invasive group compared to those of the open group. There was no significant difference in response to acetylcholine and 80 mM KCl between veins taken with the laryngoscope compared to veins taken with the traditional open technique. Similarly, histological data was unable to show any significant damage to the vessel wall. CONCLUSIONS: Because the laryngoscopic saphenectomy does not harm the harvested graft, it can be applied, instead of other minimally invasive saphenous vein harvesting systems, with a zero cost, efficiently, successfully, and with satisfactory speed and significant reduction of postoperative leg pain and wound complications.	0
20387822	Characterization of surfaces presenting covalently immobilized oligopeptides using near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. This study addresses the need for methods that validate the surface chemistry leading to the immobilization of biomolecules and provide information about the resulting structural configurations. We report on the use of near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) to characterize a widely employed immobilization chemistry that leads to the covalent attachment of a biologically relevant oligopeptide to a surface. The oligopeptide used in this study is a kinase substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a protein that is a common target for cancer therapeutics. By observing changes in the pi* and sigma* orbitals of specific nitrogen and carbon atoms (amide, imide, carbonyl), we are able to follow the sequential reactions leading to immobilization of the oligopeptide. We also show that it is possible to use NEXAFS to extend this characterization method to submonolayer densities that are relevant to biological assays. Such an element-specific chemical characterization of small peptides on surfaces fills an unmet need and establishes NEXAFS as useful technique for characterizing the immobilization of small biomolecules on surfaces.	0

10797030	Risk factors for neonatal encephalopathy in Kathmandu, Nepal, a developing country: unmatched case-control study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for neonatal encephalopathy among term infants in a developing country. DESIGN: Unmatched case-control study. SETTING: Principal maternity hospital of Kathmandu, Nepal. SUBJECTS: All 131 infants with neonatal encephalopathy from a population of 21 609 infants born over an 18 month period, and 635 unmatched infants systematically recruited over 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratio estimates for antepartum and intrapartum risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of neonatal encephalopathy was 6.1 per 1,000 live births of which 63% were infants with moderate or severe encephalopathy. The risk of death from neonatal encephalopathy was 31%. The risk of neonatal encephalopathy increased with increasing maternal age and decreasing maternal height. Antepartum risk factors included primiparity (odds ratio 2.0) and non-attendance for antenatal care (2.1). Multiple births were at greatly increased risk (22). Intrapartum risk factors included non-cephalic presentation (3.4), prolonged rupture of membranes (3.8), and various other complications. Particulate meconium was strongly associated with encephalopathy (18). Induction of labour with oxytocin was associated with encephalopathy in 12 of 41 deliveries (5.7). Overall, 78 affected infants (60%) compared with 36 controls (6%) either had evidence of intrapartum compromise or were born after an intrapartum difficulty likely to result in fetal compromise. A concentration of maternal haemoglobin of less than 8.0 g/dl in the puerperium was significantly associated with encephalopathy (2.5) as was a maternal thyroid stimulating hormone concentration greater than 5 mIU/l (2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intrapartum risk factors remain important for neonatal encephalopathy in developing countries. There is some evidence of a protective effect from antenatal care.

17513501	ABA is an essential signal for plant resistance to pathogens affecting JA biosynthesis and the activation of defenses in Arabidopsis. Analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana defense response to the damping-off oomycete pathogen Pythium irregulare show that resistance to P. irregulare requires a multicomponent defense strategy. Penetration represents a first layer, as indicated by the susceptibility of pen2 mutants, followed by recognition, likely mediated by ERECTA receptor-like kinases. Subsequent signaling of inducible defenses is predominantly mediated by jasmonic acid (JA), with insensitive coi1 mutants showing extreme susceptibility. In contrast with the generally accepted roles of ethylene and salicylic acid cooperating with or antagonizing, respectively, JA in the activation of defenses against necrotrophs, both are required to prevent disease progression, although much less so than JA. Meta-analysis of transcriptome profiles confirmed the predominant role of JA in activation of P. irregulare-induced defenses and uncovered abscisic acid (ABA) as an important regulator of defense gene expression. Analysis of cis-regulatory sequences also revealed an unexpected overrepresentation of ABA response elements in promoters of P. irregulare-responsive genes. Subsequent infections of ABA-related and callose-deficient mutants confirmed the importance of ABA in defense, acting partly through an undescribed mechanism. The results support a model for ABA affecting JA biosynthesis in the activation of defenses against this oomycete.	0

9302880	Models of shiftwork and health: an examination of the influence of stress on shiftwork theory. This paper critically reviews models of shiftwork and health and provides a historical overview of changes in the conceptualization of the association between them. Models are hypothetical and conceptually broad, becoming more so as they move away from linear, chronobiological to multidirectional, psychological conceptualizations. We attribute this tendency to the use of stress frameworks to explain the relationship between shiftwork and health. We assess the usefulness of stress as an explanatory concept in terms of how it affects shiftwork research and practice and make recommendations for future practice and theory development.	0
24334383	A knowledge-based multiple-sequence alignment algorithm. A common and cost-effective mechanism to identify the functionalities, structures, or relationships between species is multiple-sequence alignment, in which DNA/RNA/protein sequences are arranged and aligned so that similarities between sequences are clustered together. Correctly identifying and aligning these sequence biological similarities help from unwinding the mystery of species evolution to drug design. We present our knowledge-based multiple sequence alignment (KB-MSA) technique that utilizes the existing knowledge databases such as SWISSPROT, GENBANK, or HOMSTRAD to provide a more realistic and reliable sequence alignment. We also provide a modified version of this algorithm (CB-MSA) that utilizes the sequence consistency information when sequence knowledge databases are not available. Our benchmark tests on BAliBASE, PREFAB, HOMSTRAD, and SABMARK references show accuracy improvements up to 10 percent on twilight data sets against many leading alignment tools such as ISPALIGN, PADT, CLUSTALW, MAFFT, PROBCONS, and T-COFFEE.	0

18465797	Endogenous brain oscillations and related networks detected by surface EEG-combined fMRI. It is difficult to study the brain \"at rest\" with an approach generally pursued in science when external manipulation (independent variable) is used to obtain informative measurements (dependent variable) about the object of interest. External manipulation in its classic sense may suspend the resting state, and hence the object of interest will evade. Naturally, unless in a final and irreversible state, biological rest will always be an endogenously dynamic process. Combining two modalities, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to simultaneously measure the brain's activity from two angles, one can be chosen to be interpreted as the independent variable and the other as the dependent variable, and without external manipulation the brain's spontaneous dynamics can be studied. The EEG, for example, observes endogenous modulations of vigilance and detects spontaneous events such as sleep spindles or epileptic discharges and can be used as the independent variable, i.e., to form a regressor to interrogate the fMRI data (dependent variable). The opposite is possible as well, and data fusion attempts try using all data both as dependent and independent variables at the same time. This review limits itself to an exemplary discussion of simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies in humans, and among a variety of proposed resting state networks only discusses a few, especially those for which non-resting state literature has proposed a functional meaning: the \"default mode\" network and an attentional network. It will be shown that one EEG feature can correlate with different fMRI activation maps and that a single resting state network may be associated with a variety of EEG patterns giving insight into the function of different resting states and the relationship between the two modalities in themselves.	0
15778128	Effect of a fermented ginseng extract, BST204, on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in murine macrophages. This paper investigates how BST204, a fermented ginseng extract, affects the expression and mechanism of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). BST204 was prepared by incubating crude ginseng extract with ginsenoside-beta-glucosidase. Unexpectedly, BST204 had no effect on the level of COX-2 protein in unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, and it suppressed the level of COX-2 protein and PGE(2) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. It did not show any suppressive effect, though, on the COX-2 mRNA level. To investigate the suppressive mechanism of COX-2 protein, the activating phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, which are important for translation, were measured. The phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, not 4E-BP1, was increased by LPS in a time-dependent manner, and was inhibited by BST204 in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of COX-2 protein, however, was partially suppressed by rapamycin, an upstream inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase. Therefore, this paper suggests that the suppression of COX-2 protein by BST204 was partially correlated with the inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activation.	0
10644014	The effect of intrastriatal injection of liposome-entrapped tyrosinase on the dopamine levels in the rat brain. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which is mainly characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic cells in the nigro-striatal system. Due to a lowered L-tyrosine 3-monooxygenase activity, L-tyrosine is not sufficiently transformed to L-DOPA. To date the most common therapy is the administration of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA, with severe collateral effects. Therefore, the substitution of the lacking tyrosine hydroxylase with tyrosinase might be a novel therapeutical approach that would generate specifically L-DOPA from L-tyrosine. We present here evidence that stereotaxic injection of liposome-entrapped tyrosinase is able to significatively increase the levels of dopamine in the rat brain. The catecholamines L-DOPA, dopamine, L-epinephrine, L-norepinephrine were extracted by acid treatment from the brains and detected by HPLC.	0
17973596	Characteristics of the compensatory renal growth of the remnant embryonic chick kidneys. Growth of the remnant embryonic kidney (the mesonephros), as expressed by wet weight, was more rapid in the chick embryos with experimentally induced unilateral renal agenesis compared to controls. The difference was significant between embryonic days 8-12, when the doubled weights of remnant kidneys were increased compared with the weights of paired control kidneys. The excessive growth of the mesonephros ceased on day 14, when the normal physiological regression of the embryonic kidney begins. In the definitive kidney, the metanephros, no significant differences in weights of the control vs. remnant metanephros were found on days 10-14. The characteristics of increased mesonephric growth were evaluated by determination of DNA/protein ratios in homogenates of the kidneys. Significant cellular hypertrophy was found in both the mesonephros and metanephros of the embryos with URA on day 10. Additionally, a non-significant cellular hyperplasia was also revealed in the remnant mesonephros on day 8. This gives evidence that the growth stimuli to the mesonephroi were probably strongest between days 8-10 and that they manifested in the remnant mesonephros only.	0
24233573	Denitrification in salt marsh sediments: Evidence for seasonal temperature selection among populations of denitrifiers. Direct measurements of bacterial denitrification in salt marsh sediments near Woods Hole, Massachusetts were made over a 10-month period using a simple and precise gas-chromatographic technique. Based on laboratory experiments at 5  , 10  , and 20  C, it is shown that seasonal temperature variations select for at least two distinct populations of denitrifiers.In situ incubations suggest that resident populations of denitrifying bacteria are cold-sensitive. Salt marsh denitrifying bacteria are not optimally adapted to their thermal environment, but to temperatures 5  -10  C higher. In these water-logged muds, rates of bacterial denitrification (0.3-1.5 g N2/gm sediment-hr) are up to three orders of magnitude greater than maximum potential rates of insitu bacterial and algal nitrogen fixation.	0

23988749	The RENAL nephrometry score and the PADUA classification for the prediction of perioperative outcomes in patients receiving nephron-sparing surgery: feasible tools to predict intraoperative conversion to nephrectomy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of the RENAL nephrometry score and the PADUA classification in the prediction of perioperative outcomes represented by intraoperative conversion to nephrectomy in patients with renal tumors for which nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) was attempted. METHODS: Recent 100 open NSSs attempted for cT1 renal tumors at a single institution were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: With the RENAL, the operation time and ischemia time were longer in the high complexity group (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively), and blood loss was seemingly greater in this group (394 vs. 220 and 167 ml, p = 0.09). Conversion to nephrectomy was more frequent in the high complexity (4 procedures, 33.3%) than in the low (0%) and moderate (1 procedures, 1.5%) groups (p < 0.01). Regarding the PADUA, the operation time, blood loss and ischemia time increased according to the complexity (p = 0.04, p = 0.02, and p = 0.02, respectively). Conversion to nephrectomy was more frequent in the high complexity (4 procedures, 22.2%) than in the low (0%) and moderate (1 procedure, 1.8%) groups (p < 0.01). In patients with achieved NSS, postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate was more impaired in the high complexity group in the PADUA (p = 0.02), although not significant in the RENAL (p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Both the RENAL and PADUA are useful in the prediction of conversion to nephrectomy in addition to NSS-associated perioperative outcomes.	0
22870837	[The role of aldosterone and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of inflammation in familial Mediterranean fever]. The aim of the article was to study the role of aldosterone and IL-6 - in the pathogenesis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The hypersecretion of IL-6 and \"the syndrome of aldosterone excess\" in patients with FMF was revealed. The hyperactivity of the inflammatory process in FMF is one of the phenotypic factors of defective gene expression in FMF. In the course of the development of familial Mediterranean fever in presence of amyloidosis, the inhibition of mineralocorticoid function, and constantly elevated IL-6 levels, which gradually progresses bringing to an exhaustion of that function and to the dissociation of the adaptative-regulatory homeostasis. The given introduction enlarges view points of pathogenesis of FMF and confirms the multifactorial nature of FMF, in the development of which besides the genetic factors, has a great role of phenotypic factors, as well. From the phenotypic factors is hyperaldosteronemia, hyperinterleukinemia-6, which reacts with defective gene and promotes its expression, and brings to the development of FMF attacks.	0

21848068	Optimization of culture medium to increase the production of desferrioxamine B (Desferal) in Streptomyces pilosus. The aim of this study was optimization of culture medium in direction of increasing the production rate of desferrioxamine B. Streptomycetes are the most widely studied and well known genus of the actinomycete family. Streptomycetes usually inhabit soil and are important decomposers. The genus Streptomyces are Gram-positive and GC rich bacteria that are important for production of many antibiotics and secondary metabolites. These metabolites are important in industrial and medical fields. Deferoxamines (also known as desferrioxamine B, desferoxamine B, DFO-B, DFOA, DFB or desferal) are low-molecular-weight, iron-chelating compounds (siderophores) produced and secreted by many actinomycetes, including species of Streptomyces, Nocardia and Micromonospora. Streptomyces pilosus synthesizes the siderofore desferrioxamine B. Desferrioxamine B is used clinically to treat disorders related to iron overload and pathological iron deposition in human. Our results revealed that the use of soybean as a base medium plus additives such as Na2HPO4.12H2O, NaH2PO4, MgSO4.7H2O, ZnSO4.7H2O, FeSO4.7H2O, CaCl2.2H2O, NaCl, MnSO4, NH4Cl, KH2PO4, K2HPO4, some of the amino acids and vitamins increased the production of desferrioxamine B about 8 times in comparison with the control.	0

16617589	Juvenile perpetrators of homicides and attempted homicides--a case control study. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of certain aspects of family dynamics, as well as some behavior and psychological development disorders on the occurrence of homicides and attempted homicides among juveniles in the Split Dalmatian County over a period of 10 years (1989-1998). A retrospective case-control study was performed to compare juvenile murderers and attempted murderers with minors who committed other offences, i.e. property crimes. The subjects were paired according to demographic and socio-economic background. The data obtained from County Court's files included social anamnesis, specialists' observation and psychiatric expertise results. There was a significant difference between the study group and their controls in the frequency of physical violence and parental rejection during childhood. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological abnormalities were more frequent in the experimental than in the control group. Stealing occurred more often in the control group. No significant differences were found for other studied risk factors. There is no unique type of juvenile murderer. A juvenile homicide is committed under the influence of various developmental characteristics, family milieu, and constitution combined with environmental factors and perpetrator's perception of the victim.	0
22438794	Cell shape dynamics: from waves to migration. We observe and quantify wave-like characteristics of amoeboid migration. Using the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, a model system for the study of chemotaxis, we demonstrate that cell shape changes in a wave-like manner. Cells have regions of high boundary curvature that propagate from the leading edge toward the back, usually along alternating sides of the cell. Curvature waves are easily seen in cells that do not adhere to a surface, such as cells that are electrostatically repelled from surfaces or cells that extend over the edge of micro-fabricated cliffs. Without surface contact, curvature waves travel from the leading edge to the back of a cell at -35   m/min. Non-adherent myosin II null cells do not exhibit these curvature waves. At the leading edge of adherent cells, curvature waves are associated with protrusive activity. Like regions of high curvature, protrusive activity travels along the boundary in a wave-like manner. Upon contact with a surface, the protrusions stop moving relative to the surface, and the boundary shape thus reflects the history of protrusive motion. The wave-like character of protrusions provides a plausible mechanism for the zig-zagging of pseudopods and for the ability of cells both to swim in viscous fluids and to navigate complex three dimensional topography.	0
16235374	Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. BACKGROUND: Childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders are relatively common, occurring in between 5-18% of all children and adolescents. They are associated with significant morbidity and impairment in social and academic functioning, and when persistent, there is a risk of depression, suicide attempts and substance abuse in adulthood. There is accumulating evidence for the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggesting benefit. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether CBT is an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison to waiting list or attention controls. SEARCH STRATEGY: Search of the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register, which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the bibliographic databases - The Cochrane Library ( to January 2004), EMBASE, (1970-2004) MEDLINE (1970-2004) and PsycINFO (1970-2004). We also searched the references of all included studies and relevant textbooks, and contacted authors in order to identify further trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: . Each identified study was assessed for possible inclusion by two reviewers independently. Inclusion criteria consisted of randomised controlled trials of CBT versus waiting list/attention controls in children (more than six years of age) and adolescents (under the age of 19 years) with a DSM (Diagnostic Statistical Manual) or ICD (International Classification of Diseases) anxiety diagnosis; and excluding simple phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Each study was required to conform to the principles of CBT through use of a protocol and comprising at least eight sessions of CBT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by two reviewers independently. The dichotomous outcome of remission of anxiety diagnosis was pooled using relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. Means and standard deviations of anxiety symptom continuous scores were pooled using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Heterogeneity was assessed and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses undertaken. The presence of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies with 498 subjects and 311 controls met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses. The studies involved community or outpatient subjects only, with anxiety of only mild to moderate severity. ITT analyses showed a response rate for remission of any anxiety diagnosis of 56% for CBT versus 28.2% for controls (RR 0.61,95%CI 0.53 to 0.69), with no evidence of heterogeneity. The number needed to treat (NNT) was 3.0 (95%CI 2.5 to 4.5). For reduction in anxiety symptoms, the SMD was -0.58 (95% CI 0.76 to -0.40) with no significant heterogeneity indicated. Individual, group and family/parental formats of CBT produced fairly similar outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive behavioural therapy appears an effective treatment for childhood and adolescent anxiety disorders in comparison to waiting list or attention control. There was no evidence for a difference between an individual, group or parental/family format. CBT can be recommended for the treatment of childhood and anxiety disorders, although with only just over half improving, there is a need for further therapeutic developments.	0

21526103	Efficacy of interferon alpha-2b with or without ribavirin in thalassemia major patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection: A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group trial. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of monotherapy with interferon alpha-2b and combination therapy with interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin on chronic hepatitis C infection in thalassaemic patients. METHODS: In parallel group randomized, double blind, controlled trial, 32 thalassaemic patients with chronic hepatitis C infection completed the study. In a random fashion, one group was treated with three million units of interferon alpha-2b three times a week plus ribavirin (800-1200 mg daily). The second group received interferon alpha-2b alone. Treatment duration was 24-48 weeks. Primary efficacy variables were HCV RNA after treatment and sustained viral response (SVR) six months after treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 22    7.4 years; 19 (59.4%) were male and 13 (40.6) were female. At the end of treatment, no statistically significant differences were found between the groups in HCV RNA and AST. The proportion of patients with SVR six months after treatment was significantly greater in the monotherapy group (90.9%) than in the combination therapy group (44.4%; p = 0.049). A significant difference in mean of ALT was also obtained at the end of treatment between monotherapy and combination therapy groups (30.4    19.2 and 60.1    48.9, respectively; p = 0.02). Response rates were not associated with genotype and severity of hepatitis C infection in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that monotherapy may be considered as the first-line therapy in patients with thalassemia.	0
16393789	A practical approach towards accurate dense 3D depth recovery for robotic laparoscopic surgery. OBJECTIVE: Recovering tissue deformation during robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is an important step towards motion compensation and stabilization. This article presents a practical strategy for dense 3D depth recovery and temporal motion tracking for deformable surfaces. METHODS: The method combines image rectification with constrained disparity registration for reliable depth estimation. The accuracy and practical value of the technique are validated using a tissue phantom with known 3D geometry and motion characteristics and in vivo data. RESULTS: Results from the phantom model correctly follow the motion trend indicated from the ground truth provided by CT scanning, and regression analysis shows the intrinsic accuracy that can be achieved with the proposed technique. Results applied to in vivo robotic-assisted MIS data are also provided, indicating the practical value of the proposed method. CONCLUSION: The proposed method presents a practical strategy for dense depth recovery of surface structure in robotic-assisted MIS that incorporates stereo vision. Results on phantom and in vivo data indicate the quality of the method and also highlight the importance of further considering the effects of specular highlights.	0
17334445	Assessment of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer algorithm for retrieval of aerosol parameters over the ocean. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aerosol algorithm over the ocean derives spectral aerosol optical depth and aerosol size parameters from satellite measured radiances at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). It is based on the adding of apparent optical properties (AOPs): TOA reflectance is approximated as a linear combination of reflectances resulting from a small particle mode and a large particle mode. The weighting parameter eta is defined as the fraction of the optical depth at 550 nm due to the small mode. The AOP approach is correct only in the single scattering limit. For a physically correct TOA reflectance simulation, we create linear combinations of the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of small and large particle modes, in which the weighting parameter f is defined as the fraction of the number density attributed to the small particle mode. We use these IOPs as inputs to an accurate multiple scattering radiative transfer model. We find that reflectance errors incurred with the AOP method are as high as 30% for an aerosol optical depth of 2 at 550 nm. The retrieved optical depth has a relative error of up to 8%, and the retrieved fraction eta has an absolute error of approximately 6%. We show that the use of accurate radiative transfer simulations and a bimodal fraction f yields accurate values for the retrieved optical depth and the fraction f.	0
10476598	Diagnostic value of exercise electrocardiography for predicting a positive scintigraphic test in patients with complete right bundle branch block. BACKGROUND: The diagnostic value of exercise electrocardiography (ECG) in patients with complete right bundle block (cRBBB) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of exercise ECG for predicting ischemia in the presence of cRBBB. METHODS: From a series of 1300 consecutive patients attending for exercise ECG and 99mTc-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), we identified 38 male patients with cRBBB and 38 matched controls with normal intraventricular conduction. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or previous revascularization were excluded. Exercise ECG (modified Bruce protocol) was considered positive at > or = 1 mm ST horizontal or downsloping depression in > or = 2 adjacent leads. SPECT imaging at rest and post-exercise was performed at least 48 hours apart. RESULTS: The odds ratio for ischemia comparing patients with positive and negative exercise ECGs was 11.0 (95% confidence interval 2.49-48.64, p = 0.002) in controls and 2.49 (95% confidence interval 0.64-9.08, p = 0.32) in cRBBB. The prior probability of ischemia was 0.37 in controls and 0.58 with cRBBB. The posterior probability after a positive test was 0.65 in controls and 0.68 in cRBBB. Thus, the utility of the test (posterior probability minus prior probability) was greater in controls (+0.28) than in cRBBB (+0.1). This difference was most pronounced in the anterior leads V1-V4 (controls +0.63 vs cRBBB +0.01) but less significant in the lateral leads V5-V6 (controls +0.26 vs cRBBB +0.21). Similar analysis also indicated reduced diagnostic value of negative exercise ECGs in cRBBB patients. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of exercise ECG is reduced in patients with cRBBB, although ST-segment changes in the lateral ECG territory provide superior predictive accuracy to those in the anterior leads. The use of SPECT as a first-line investigation may be justified in patients with cRBBB.	0
17619074	Human gastric cells resistant to (-)-epigallocatechin gallate show cross-resistance to several environmental pollutants. After a long-term culture in (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, 20 microM), a major constituent of green tea, human gastric AGS cells developed 2.2-fold resistance to EGCG. The resistant AGS (AGS-R) cells were cross-resistant to several N-methylcarbamate insecticides, which are among the major control agents for pest insects in Taiwan. The AGS-R cells also showed protective effects against both the cytotoxicity and DNA damage induced by one of the mutagenic derivatives of N-methylcarbamate insecticide, N-nitroso methomyl, which is known to target the mammalian gastric tract. Therefore, acquisition of resistance by AGS cells through chronic exposure to EGCG implies that the tea-drinking habit of the Taiwanese is probably beneficial for the health of the gastric tract. In addition, AGS-R cells were cross-resistant to sodium arsenite and hydrogen peroxide, indicating that tolerance to oxidative stress might play a role in the development of resistance described in this investigation.	0
19995950	c-Rel is required for the development of thymic Foxp3+ CD4 regulatory T cells. During thymopoiesis, a unique program of gene expression promotes the development of CD4 regulatory T (T reg) cells. Although Foxp3 maintains a pattern of gene expression necessary for T reg cell function, other transcription factors are emerging as important determinants of T reg cell development. We show that the NF-kappaB transcription factor c-Rel is highly expressed in thymic T reg cells and that in c-rel(-/-) mice, thymic T reg cell numbers are markedly reduced as a result of a T cell-intrinsic defect that is manifest during thymocyte development. Although c-Rel is not essential for TGF-beta conversion of peripheral CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells into CD4(+)Foxp3(+) cells, it is required for optimal homeostatic expansion of peripheral T reg cells. Despite a lower number of peripheral T reg cells in c-rel(-/-) mice, the residual peripheral c-rel(-/-) T reg cells express normal levels of Foxp3, display a pattern of cell surface markers and gene expression similar to those of wild-type T reg cells, and effectively suppress effector T cell function in culture and in vivo. Collectively, our results indicate that c-Rel is important for both the thymic development and peripheral homeostatic proliferation of T reg cells.	0

16797030	The effect of differential survivorship on the stability of reproductive queueing. Queues, in which individuals inherit resources in a predictable, temporally stable order, are widespread in animal social groups. We develop an analytic model to explore the effect of differential survivorship on the stability of a reproductive queue. We show that unless fighting for dominance is potentially fatal, future direct benefits are not alone sufficient to stabilize a queue of non-relatives under constant (age-independent) mortality rates, regardless of whether a dominant becomes an isolate or remains a dominant on the death of the first subordinate. In the absence of fatal fighting, stabilization of such a queue by future direct benefits alone requires either the dominant or the subordinate to have age-dependent mortality rates. Even when the queue is stabilized by present direct reproduction, however, the shape of the lifespan distribution can make a significant difference to the size of the required incentive. In contrast to non-relatives, queues of relatives can be stable without age-dependent mortality, so long as relatedness exceeds a critical value; however, age-dependent mortality can lower this critical value.	0

18654815	DGGE and T-RFLP analysis of bacterial succession during mushroom compost production and sequence-aided T-RFLP profile of mature compost. The amount of button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) harvested from compost is largely affected by the microbial processes taking place during composting and the microbes inhabiting the mature compost. In this study, the microbial changes during the stages of this specific composting process were monitored, and the dominant bacteria of the mature compost were identified to reveal the microbiological background of the favorable properties of the heat-treated phase II mushroom compost. 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA)-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) molecular fingerprinting methods were used to track the succession of microbial communities in summer and winter composting cycles. DNA from individual DGGE bands were reamplified and subjected to sequence analysis. Principal component analysis of fingerprints of the composting processes showed intensive changes in bacterial community during the 22-day procedure. Peak temperature samples grouped together and were dominated by Thermus thermophilus. Mature compost patterns were almost identical by both methods (DGGE, T-RFLP). To get an in-depth analysis of the mature compost bacterial community, the sequence data from cultivation of the bacteria and cloning of environmental 16S rDNA were uniquely coupled with the output of the environmental T-RFLP fingerprints (sequence-aided T-RFLP). This method revealed the dominance of a supposedly cellulose-degrading consortium composed of phylotypes related to Pseudoxanthomonas, Thermobifida, and Thermomonospora.	0
20463245	Blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is an endemic mycosis that occurs predominantly in North America in the north central United States and provinces of Canada, southern states, and those midwestern states that border the Mississippi River basin. It causes acute and chronic pneumonias and disseminated infection with cutaneous lesions as the major extrapulmonary manifestation. However, the vast majority of infected persons are asymptomatic or have mild respiratory symptoms that are not diagnosed as being caused by a fungal infection. Rarely, patients develop severe pulmonary infection that progresses to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high mortality rate. A urinary antigen test is now available to aid in diagnosis, but it is not specific and is positive in patients who have histoplasmosis as well as blastomycosis. Antibody assays remain nonspecific and insensitive, and the confirmatory diagnostic test is still growth of the organism in culture. Updated guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America are available to aid clinicians in the management of the various forms of blastomycosis.	0

The 4-G conjugate forms a stable G-quadruplex under low or high potassium ion concentrations, whereas the 3-G conjugate forms a stable G-quadruplex only in the presence of high potassium. The 2-G conjugate fails to form a stable G-quadruplex even at low temperature and high potassium concentration. Both pyrene monomer and excimer fluorescence are observed for the G-quadruplex structures, whereas only monomer fluorescence is observed for the single-strand conjugates. Thus, pyrene excimer fluorescence can be used as a probe for the formation of G-quadruplex structures. The excimer/monomer intensity ratios for the G-quadruplex structures are dependent upon both the temperature and potassium or lithium salt concentration. The salt effect is attributed to a change in the structure of the hydrophobic pyrene chromophores, which are assembled on the 5'-face of the G-quadruplex as a consequence of electrostriction.	0
24085563	Neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease: interactions of oxidative stress, tryptophan catabolites and depression with mitochondria and sirtuins. The biological underpinnings to the etiology and course of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease are an area of extensive research that has yet to produce an early biological marker or disease-slowing or preventative treatment. Recent conceptualizations of Parkinson's disease have integrated immuno-inflammation and oxidative and nitrosative stress occurring in depression, somatization and peripheral inflammation into the course of Parkinson's disease. We review the data showing the importance of immuno-inflammatory processes and oxidative and nitrosative stress in such classically conceived 'comorbidities', suggesting that lifetime, prodromal and concurrent depression and somatization may be intricately involved in the etiology and course of Parkinson's disease, rather than psychiatric comorbidities. This produces a longer term developmental perspective of Parkinson's disease, which incorporates tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs), lipid peroxidation, sirtuins, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and circadian genes. This integrates wider bodies of data pertaining to neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease, emphasizing how these interact with susceptibility genes to drive changes in mitochondria, blood-brain barrier permeability and intercellular signalling. We review this data here in the context of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and to the future directions indicated for slowing disease progression.	0

21328083	Entorhinal cortex volume is associated with episodic memory related brain activation in normal aging and amnesic mild cognitive impairment. The present study examined the relationship between entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume with fMRI activation during episodic memory function in elderly controls with no cognitive impairment and individuals with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Both groups displayed limited evidence for a relationship between hippocampal volume and fMRI activation. Smaller right entorhinal cortex volume was correlated with reduced activation in left and right medial frontal cortex (BA 8) during incidental encoding for both aMCI and elderly controls. However, during recognition, smaller left entorhinal cortex volume correlated with reduced activation in right BA 8 for the control group, but greater activation for the aMCI group. There was no significant relationship between entorhinal cortex volume and activation during intentional encoding in either group. The recognition-related dissociation in structure/function relationships in aMCI paralleled our behavioral findings, where individuals with aMCI displayed poorer performance relative to controls during recognition, but not encoding. Taken together, these results suggest that the relationship between entorhinal cortex volume and fMRI activation during episodic memory function is altered in individuals with aMCI.	0
15182268	Pulmonary fibrosis in myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides. OBJECTIVE: The association of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) with myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-associated vasculitides has not been well documented. The aim of this study was to assess the clinicopathological characteristics of PF in patients who tested positive for MPO-ANCA. METHODOLOGY: In this study, 31 patients (17 males and 14 females; mean age, 69 years) diagnosed as having PF with positive MPO-ANCA levels ranging from 10 to 840 EU with a mean of 112.5 EU, were evaluated clinicopathologically. RESULTS: Among 31 patients with PF, 22 had underlying systemic diseases such as collagen vascular diseases, while nine had unknown aetiology. Evidence of glomerulonephritis was demonstrated in 14 patients. The clinical features were a history of dry cough and/or fine crackles in all 31 patients. Chest CT scans showed honeycombing in the lung bases in 26 patients. The histopathological features of the diseased lung tissues in all 11 autopsied cases were compatible with the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern. Vasculitis was confirmed in bronchial arteries and/or pulmonary arterioles in five patients. The mortality was as high as 13 of the 31 patients. The causes of death were: deterioration of PF in five (two of whom were associated with pulmonary haemorrhage), lung cancer in two, pneumonia in four, and digestive tract bleeding in two. The survival rates in PF with MPO-ANCA-negative collagen vascular diseases, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), and PF with positive MPO-ANCA, were compared. The 5-year survival rate in PF with positive MPO-ANCA was worse than in PF with MPO-ANCA-negative collagen vascular diseases and was the same for CFA. CONCLUSION: Although there was no correlation between MPO-ANCA titres and the activity of PF, this study demonstrated that the presence of positive MPO-ANCA was an unfavorable prognostic factor in patients with PF.	0
7972816	Cardiac pacemaker electrodes: improved methods of extraction. Work in progress. PURPOSE: To develop improved methods of extracting pacemaker electrodes from the femoral vein by using standard equipment and techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pacemaker electrodes were removed from 61 patients aged 21-91 years (mean, 68 years). In 25 patients (41%), traction was applied to locking stylets to remove electrodes at the subclavian vein entry site. In 30 patients, the electrode tip was freed with traction at the subclavian vein entry site. The electrode was then extracted through a sheath placed in the femoral vein. In six patients (10%), the electrode tip was freed via the femoral vein when traction was applied to grasping devices. The electrode was then removed through a femoral venous sheath. RESULTS: Ninety-nine (95%) of 104 pacemaker electrodes were extracted completely. Two electrodes were trapped in fibrous tissue in the subclavian vein. One right atrial tear occurred. CONCLUSION: Pacemaker electrodes can be removed effectively by using percutaneous techniques.	0
11950945	Reorientation of mispositioned spindles in short astral microtubule mutant spc72Delta is dependent on spindle pole body outer plaque and Kar3 motor protein. Nuclear migration and positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae depend on long astral microtubules emanating from the spindle pole bodies (SPBs). Herein, we show by in vivo fluorescence microscopy that cells lacking Spc72, the SPB receptor of the cytoplasmic gamma-tubulin complex, can only generate very short (<1 microm) and unstable astral microtubules. Consequently, nuclear migration to the bud neck and orientation of the anaphase spindle along the mother-bud axis are absent in these cells. However, SPC72 deletion is not lethal because elongated but misaligned spindles can frequently reorient in mother cells, permitting delayed but otherwise correct nuclear segregation. High-resolution time-lapse sequences revealed that this spindle reorientation was most likely accomplished by cortex interactions of the very short astral microtubules. In addition, a set of double mutants suggested that reorientation was dependent on the SPB outer plaque and the astral microtubule motor function of Kar3 but not Kip2/Kip3/Dhc1, or the cortex components Kar9/Num1. Our observations suggest that Spc72 is required for astral microtubule formation at the SPB half-bridge and for stabilization of astral microtubules at the SPB outer plaque. In addition, our data exclude involvement of Spc72 in spindle formation and elongation functions.	0

24228173	Direct Effect of Two Naphthalene-Sulfonyl-Indole Compounds on Toxoplasma gondii Tachyzoite. Past studies have stated that the parasitostatic effect of IFN-y is most likely due to the starvation of Toxoplasma gondii for tryptophan in the host cell. The aim of this study was to evaluate the direct effect of two new Naphthalene-Sulfonyl-Indole compounds as competitive molecules for tryptophan on viability and infectivity of Toxoplasma tachyzoites. Tachyzoites of RH strain were incubated in various concentrations (25-800    M) of 1-(naphthalene-2-sulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole and 1-[5-(2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-1-sulfonyl)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole for 1.5 hours. Then, they were stained by PI and analyzed by FACS. To evaluate the infectivity, 2   10(6) tachyzoites exposed to the concentrations mentioned above were intraperitoneally inoculated into five mice from each group. Also, na  ve parasites and parasites exposed to DMSO (control) were inoculated in both groups of mice. The LD50 of 1-(naphthalene-2-sulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole was 62    mol whilst the quantity of 1-[5-(2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-1-sulfonyl)naphthalene-1-sulfonyl]-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole was more than 800    mol. The infectivity of tachyzoites exposed to both of the compounds preserved and killed mice. No statistical correlation was seen between longevity of mice groups and different doses of the compounds. If we consider a well-organized transporter mechanism for indole compounds in the parasite, thus the designation of an antagonist that has indole groups can assist with the production of new drugs.	0
9794329	Patient-specific evidence-based care recommendations for diabetes mellitus: development and initial clinic experience with a computerized decision support system. BACKGROUND: adherence with evidence-based recommendations for chronic disease management is often suboptimal. Providing patient-specific reminders at the time of clinical encounters has the potential to improve this situation. A necessary prerequisite for providing such reminders, however, is to have an efficient means of acquiring patient information that can be matched to an underlying knowledge base. The decision support system: we have developed a computer-based, self-administered questionnaire for diabetes care. The questionnaire assesses numerous diabetes-related topics. Patients complete the questionnaire using a touchscreen interface, and their responses are then matched to evidence-based guidelines so that patient-specific care suggestions can be provided for both the patients and their health care professionals. The guidelines are derived from a database of abstracts of studies of diabetes care that are screened for scientific merit and clinical relevance, supplemented by recommendations from diabetes organizations. EVALUATION: initial evaluation of the system included an assessment of the agreement of responses to the automated questionnaire with responses to similar questions administered during a structured, personal interview. Overall agreement was 92.5% and the majority of disagreements were minor. More recently, patients aged 18-69 years have been completing the automated questionnaire before appointments at a diabetes clinic. The average time required has been 10.9 min and a mean of 3.0 recommendations have been provided per patient. Patient and health care practitioner satisfaction with the questionnaire and the patient-specific feedback have been high. CONCLUSIONS: evidence-based patient-specific diabetes care recommendations can be provided using a self-administered computer-based questionnaire.	0
16300731	ATF5 increases cisplatin-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of cyclin D3 transcription in HeLa cells. ATF5 transcription factor plays an essential role in hematopoietic and glioma cell survival and neuronal cell differentiation. Here, we report for the first time the pro-apoptosis role of ATF5 and identify Cyclin D3 as an ATF5-targeted apoptosis-related gene. The ectopic expression of ATF5 in HeLa cells could markedly increase cisplatin-induced apoptosis and the cleavage of Caspase-3, and induce Cyclin D3 mRNA expression via cooperation with E2F1 transcription factor. Moreover, the interference of Cyclin D3 expression by transfection with Cyclin D3 RNAi could protect cells from ATF5-mediated apoptosis induced by cisplatin, indicating the contribution of Cyclin D3 in ATF5-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that ATF5 increases cisplatin-induced apoptosis through up-regulation of Cyclin D3 transcription, which elicits survival signals in HeLa cells.	1

8982448	Control of transcription termination in prokaryotes. A growing number of genetic systems have been shown to be controlled at the level of premature termination of transcription. Genes in this class contain transcription termination signals in the region upstream of the coding sequence. The activity of these regulatory termination signals is controlled through a variety of mechanisms. These include modification of RNA polymerase to a terminator-resistant, or terminator-prone form, and alterations in the structure of the nascent transcript, to determine whether the stem-loop structure of an intrinsic terminator or an alternate antiterminator is formed. Structural alterations in the transcript can be controlled by the kinetics of translation of the RNA, by binding of specific regulatory proteins, and by mRNA-tRNA interactions. This review describes a number of variations on the termination control theme that have been uncovered in prokaryotes.	0
20813231	Lightness, chroma, and hue distributions of a shade guide as measured by a spectroradiometer. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The color attributes of commercially available shade guides have been measured by spectrophotometers (SP), which are designed to measure flat surfaces. However, there is limited information on the color distribution of shade guides as measured by spectroradiometers (SR), which are capable of measuring the color of curved surfaces. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the distributions of lightness (CIE L*) and chroma (C*(ab)) step intervals between adjacent shade tabs of a shade guide based on the lightness, chroma, and hue attributes measured by an SR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lightness, chroma, hue angle, and CIE a* and b* values of the shade tabs (n=26) from a shade guide (Vitapan 3D-Master) were measured by an SR under daylight conditions. The distributions of the ratios in lightness and chroma of each tab compared with the lowest lightness tab or the lowest chroma tab were determined. The values for each color parameter were analyzed by a 3-way ANOVA with the factors of lightness, chroma, and hue designations of the shade tabs (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The chroma and CIE a* and b* values were influenced by the lightness, chroma, and hue designations of the shade tabs (P<.001); however, the lightness and hue angle were influenced by the lightness and hue designations, but not by the chroma designation. Distributions for the CIE a* and b* values, in each lightness group, corresponded with the chroma designation. However, the intervals in the lightness and chroma scales between adjacent tabs were not uniform. CONCLUSIONS: The intervals in the color parameters between adjacent shade tabs were not uniform based on SR measurements. Therefore, a shade guide in which shade tabs are more equally spaced by the color attributes, based on the values as measured by an SR along with observers' responses with respect to the equality of the intervals, should be devised.	0
10885239	[Anesthetic management of heart transplantation]. We anesthetized a 47-yr-old man with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for heart transplantation. This is the first case of heart transplantation from a patient with brain death, since the organ transplantation law had become valid in Japan. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with fentanyl and diazepam. Aseptic technique was used in inserting and securing all catheters. The patient was assisted by left ventricular assist system, and hemodynamic suppression at anesthetic induction was trivial. Since complete AV block was present at the termination of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), VVI pacing and infusion of isoproterenol were started. In addition, nitroglycerin was given for pulmonary vasodilation. The cardiovascular support used for weaning from CPB included dobutamine, isoprote-renol, dopamine and milrinone. Following weaning from CPB sinus rhythm appeared spontaneously and function of the transplanted heart was satisfactory. When the patient was transported to ICU reduction in doses of catecholamines was possible, and dopamine and milrinone were infused. The patient was extubated 10 hours after admission to ICU.	0

22080558	HotRegion: a database of predicted hot spot clusters. Hot spots are energetically important residues at protein interfaces and they are not randomly distributed across the interface but rather clustered. These clustered hot spots form hot regions. Hot regions are important for the stability of protein complexes, as well as providing specificity to binding sites. We propose a database called HotRegion, which provides the hot region information of the interfaces by using predicted hot spot residues, and structural properties of these interface residues such as pair potentials of interface residues, accessible surface area (ASA) and relative ASA values of interface residues of both monomer and complex forms of proteins. Also, the 3D visualization of the interface and interactions among hot spot residues are provided. HotRegion is accessible at http://prism.ccbb.ku.edu.tr/hotregion.	0
18051755	Transcriptome analysis of phosphate starvation response in Escherichia coli. Escherichia coli has a PhoR-PhoB two-component regulatory system to detect and respond to the changes of environmental phosphate concentration. For the E. coli W3110 strain growing under phosphate-limiting condition, the changes of global gene expression levels were investigated by using DNA microarray analysis. The expression levels of some genes that are involved in phosphate metabolism were increased as phosphate became limited, whereas those of the genes involved in ribosomal protein or amino acid metabolism were decreased, owing to the stationary phase response. The upregulated genes could be divided into temporarily and permanently inducible genes by phosphate starvation. At the peak point showing the highest expression levels of the phoB and phoR genes under phosphate-limiting condition, the phoB- and/or phoR-dependent regulatory mechanisms were investigated in detail by comparing the gene expression levels among the wild-type and phoB and/or phoR mutant strains. Overall, the phoB mutation was epistatic over the phoR mutation. It was found that PhoBR and PhoB were responsible for the upregulation of the phosphonate or glycerol phosphate metabolism and high-affinity phosphate transport system, respectively. These results show the complex regulation by the PhoR-PhoB two-component regulatory system in E. coli.	0
21448695	Aberrant CpG island hypermethylation and down-regulation of Oct-6 mRNA expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Aberrant CpG island hypermethylation is a major epigenetic mechanism that can inactivate the transcription of cancer-related genes. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate whether Oct-6 transcription was regulated by CpG island methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR and the MassARRAY platform (Sequenom) were employed in 38 HCC tissues samples and four cell lines. RESULTS: The levels of Oct-6 mRNA were decreased by more than twofold in 31 of 38 tumor tissues compared to that of adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Among the 31 tumor tissues with lower levels of Oct-6 mRNA, 17 tumor tissues also had higher methylation levels in Oct-6 CpG island. Based on these results, we hypothesized that CpG island hypermethylation may down-regulate Oct-6 mRNA expression in HCC. To confirm this hypothesis, we also analyzed the changes in Oct-6 mRNA expression and CpG island methylation in four HCC cell lines (Huh7, Bel-7402, HepG2 and SMMC-7721) after treatment with 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5   M 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR), a demethylating agent. The results demonstrated that the CpG island methylation levels decreased and Oct-6 mRNA levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in both Huh7 and Bel7402 cells, but there were only slight changes in HepG2 cell. Interestingly, there were no significant alterations of Oct-6 mRNA levels observed in SMMC7721 cell; although lower levels of CpG island methylation were detected after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that CpG island hypermethylation contributes to down-regulation of Oct-6 mRNA expression in HCC.	0
23841134	Arteficially induced \"monovision\" is vitium artis and in reality corresponds with the \"Monofixation Syndrome\". Monovision is a method, most frequently used, in correction of presbyopia, especially by begining presbyops. These persons want to see well at distance and also for near without the usual changes of eyeglasses correction. Sometimes this method is also applied by myopia and psedophakic eyes (pseudophakic monovision). In myopia and hyperopia the dominant eye is corrected for distance and non-domimnant for near less correction. By monovision, especially induced by Lasik, conductive keratoplasty and contact lenses, we can decrease the important visual function, such as contrast sensitivity, stereopsis, confusion in the field of Panum's area and visual field, and for this reason we conclude that this method of arteficially induced monovision is professionally incorrect and presents a vitium artis in optometric's practice and corresponds with the \"Monofixation Syndrome\".	0

23263276	Direct-write 3D nanolithography at cryogenic temperatures. Direct-write three-dimensional nanolithography is demonstrated using cryogenic electron beam-induced deposition (EBID). Cryogenic cooling and an electron beam were used to condense and expose the precursor methylcyclopentadienyl(trimethyl)platinum (MeCpPtMe(3)). The exposure process was modeled by Monte Carlo simulations of electron-condensate interactions, which were used to develop two approaches for the fabrication of three-dimensional self-supporting structures with incorporated gaps. Vertical and lateral resolutions of approximately 150 and 22 nm are demonstrated, and underlying mechanisms that limit resolution and throughput are identified. Resolution can be traded off for condensate exposure efficiency, which is shown to be up to four orders of magnitude greater than that of conventional, room temperature EBID.	0
22933843	When research meets reality-lessons learned from a pragmatic multisite group-randomized clinical trial on psychosocial interventions in the psychiatric and addiction field. Research on treatments for patients with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders is of core importance and at the same time highly challenging as it includes patients that are normally excluded from clinical studies. Such research may require methodological adaptations which in turn create new challenges. However, the challenges that arise in such studies are insufficiently discussed in the literature. The aim of this methodology paper is, firstly, to discuss the methodological adaptations that may be required in such research; secondly, to describe how such adaptations created new challenges in a group-randomized clinical trial on Integrated Treatment amongst patients with co-occurring psychiatric and substance use disorders. We also discuss how these challenges might be understood and highlight lessons for future research in this field. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00447733.	0
12453415	NFATc2-mediated repression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression. The calcineurin-regulated transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), controls many aspects of T cell function. Here, we demonstrate that the calcineurin/NFAT pathway negatively regulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). A canonical NFAT binding site was identified and found to be sensitive to calcium signals, FK506/CsA, and histone deacetylase activity and to not require AP-1. Ectopic expression of NFATc2 inhibited the basal activity of the human CDK4 promoter. Additionally, both calcineurin Aalpha(-/-) and NFATc2(-/-) mice had elevated protein levels of CDK4, confirming a negative regulatory role for the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. This pathway may thus regulate the expression of CDK4 at the transcriptional level and control how cells re-enter a resting, nonproliferative state.	1

17580108	Preparation of novel polymeric microspheres for controlled release of finasteride. The utility of the novel polycarbonate, poly(propylene carbonate maleate) (PPCM) to encapsulate and control the release of finasteride, via microspheres, was investigated. The PPCM microspheres loaded with finasteride were elaborated by a simple oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion-solvent evaporation method. Various manufacturing parameters, including the concentration of polymer in dichloromethane (DCM) and the polymer:finasteride ratios were altered to optimize process variables during the microspheres production. The effects of these changes on the characteristics of the microspheres were examined. The structure and morphology were characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the mean diameter of microspheres was approximately 2mum, and had both smooth and spherical surfaces. Greater encapsulation efficiency was obtained by increasing the ratios of polymer:finasteride and the concentration of PPCM in DCM. In vitro drug release of these microcapsules was performed in a pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered solution. The release profiles of finasteride from PPCM microcapsules were found to be biphasic with a burst release followed by a gradual release phase. A prolonged in vitro drug release profile was observed. After an initial burst, a continuous drug release was observed for up to 5-6 weeks.	0
11403690	Lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus reduce paradoxical sleep (PS) propensity: evidence from a short-term PS deprivation study in rats. Cholinergic neurons in the mesopontine tegmentum are thought to play a critical role in the generation of paradoxical sleep (PS). However, no study has yet examined whether lesions of these neurons cause deficits of PS in the rat. We describe here the effects of lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) on spontaneous PS and on PS propensity, expressed during and after a short period of PS deprivation. Lesions were induced by bilateral injections of ibotenate. PS deprivation was performed manually by gently waking rats each time they showed polygraphic signs of PS. Two weeks after lesions, an 8-h baseline recording was performed; the following day, rats were PS deprived for 6 h and polygraphic recordings were then continued for 2 h, to examine recovery sleep. The same protocol was repeated 1 week later. Compared with controls and with rats with limited PPT lesions, rats bearing > 60% NADPH-diaphorase-positive cell loss within the PPT showed unaffected PS under baseline conditions. However, they made fewer attempts to enter PS during deprivation and they exhibited an attenuated rebound increase in PS time after deprivation. The number of PS attempts and the magnitude of PS rebound were negatively correlated with the percent loss of diaphorase-positive neurons within the PPT. Thus, PS propensity that accumulated as a result of PS deprivation was reduced after extensive PPT lesions. In summary, although spontaneous PS was found to be unaltered, the PS deprivation procedure used in this study demonstrated the dysfunctioning of PS caused by PPT lesions.	0

9188725	Phosphoinositide binding specificity among phospholipase C isozymes as determined by photo-cross-linking to novel substrate and product analogs. We tested for the presence of high-affinity phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] and PI(3,4,5)P3 binding sites in four phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes (delta1, beta1, beta2, and beta3), by probing these proteins with analogs of inositol phosphates, D-Ins(1,4,5)P3, D-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and InsP6, and polyphosphoinositides PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, which contain a photoactivatable benzoyldihydrocinnamide moiety. Only PLC-delta1 was specifically radiolabeled. More than 90% of the label was found in tryptic and chymotryptic fragments which reacted with antisera against the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, whereas less than 5% was recovered in fragments that encompassed the catalytic core. In separate experiments, the isolated delta1-PH domain was also specifically labeled. Equilibrium binding of D-Ins(1,4,5)P3 to PLC-delta1 indicated the presence of a single, high-affinity binding site; binding of D-Ins(1,4,5)P3 to PLC-beta1, -beta2, or -beta3 was not detected. The catalytic activity of PLC-delta1 was inhibited by the product D-Ins(1,4,5)P3, whereas no inhibition of PLC-beta1, -beta2, or -beta3 activity was observed. These results demonstrate that the PH domain is the sole high-affinity PI(4,5)P2 binding site of PLC-delta1 and that a similar site is not present in PLC-beta1, -beta2, or -beta3. The data are consistent with the idea that the PH domain of PLC-delta1, but not the beta isozymes, directs the catalytic core to membranes enriched in PI(4,5)P2 and is subject to product inhibition.	0

7916742	Prothymosin alpha gene in humans: organization of its promoter region and localization to chromosome 2. A genomic clone encoding prothymosin alpha (gene symbol: PTMA), a nuclear-targeted protein associated with cell proliferation, was isolated and the 5'-regulatory region subcloned and sequenced. Because of previously reported discrepancies between several cDNA clones and a genomic clone for prothymosin alpha, we determined the sequence of the first exon and of a 1.7-kb region 5' to the first exon. The sequence of the genomic clone reported here corresponds to the published cDNA sequences, suggesting that the previously noted discrepancies may be due to genetic polymorphism in this region. In addition, our sequence data extend the known 5'-upstream sequence by an additional 1.5 kb allowing the identification of numerous, potential cis-acting regulatory sites. This 5'-flanking cloned probe permitted us to localize the prothymosin gene to chromosome 2 in humans.	0

The pattern of external ear abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder was studied. Sixty-seven male patients having schizophrenia (n=30) and bipolar disorder (n=37) were examined using a scale constructed for the study. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that 'prominent crux of helix' and 'ear lobe crease' could differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These external ear abnormalities need further characterization and consideration for possible inclusion in scales that assess minor physical anomalies.	0
24015752	How direct-to-consumer drug websites convey disease information: analysis of stigma-reducing components. Given the growing trend of the Internet as a source of health information, this study evaluated whether direct-to-consumer prescription drug websites for stigmatized illnesses contained stigma-reducing components: onset controllability, offset controllability, and recategorization. The authors examined the contents of the first-level homepages and the second-level pages in 88 stand-alone websites for 15 different stigmatized conditions. Overall, about a third of the websites did not provide a direct link to detailed disease information on the homepage. On the homepages, three stigma-reducing components were rarely offered either through textual or visual cues. On the second level, in terms of textual cues, onset controllability and recategorization were the most prevalent, while offset controllability was relatively less frequent. There were no visual cues on the second level. Results point out the limited and insufficient stigma-reducing components of direct-to-consumer prescription drug websites.	0

Monitoring of HIV viral load in low and middle income settings is limited by high cost of the commercial assays. Therefore, we developed a novel RT-PCR quantitative assay was developed. This assay targets the HIV-1 pol integrase gene (INT). Subsequently, the performance of the INT assay, described previously as a Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) assay and a combined INT/LTR dual target RT-PCR assay was compared. The LTR-assay was found to be sensitive and cost-effective (50-70% cheaper than commercial assays) with the lowest coefficient of variation (%CV). Introduction of an internal standard further improved assay reliability. Therefore, this LTR assay was implemented in West Java, Indonesia. Linearity and precision of the LTR assay were good: %CV ranged from 1.0% to 10.4%. The limit of quantitation was 616 copies/ml. Performance was comparable with the commercial assay (Abbott assay) (r(2)=0.01), although on average the viral loads were 0.39 log(10)copies/ml lower. In clinical practice, it had excellent capability for monitoring treatment failure, the positive predictive value was 99% and the negative predictive value was 93%. In conclusion, the implementation of the improved HIV-1 viral load LTR-assay for routine diagnosis in resource poor settings can be a good alternative when commercial assays are unaffordable.	0
23625113	Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system does not reduce platelet activity at rest or during stress in hypertension. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the influence of angiotensin receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on stress-induced platelet activation in hypertensive patients. Secondary aims were effects on inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial function. METHODS: Following a 4-week placebo period, 25 hypertensive patients entered a double-blind, crossover study comparing enalapril (20mg once daily) and losartan (100mg once daily) treatment (each for 8 weeks). Patients were studied at rest and after a standardized exercise test. RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure was reduced from 119  2 to 104  2 (enalapril) and 106  2 (losartan)mmHg (both P<0.001). Plasma angiotensin II decreased from 2.4  0.4 to 0.5  0.1pmol/l with enalapril, and increased to 7.2  1.3pmol/l with losartan (both P<0.001). Exercise-evoked platelet activation, as evidenced by increased numbers of P-selectin-positive platelets (P<0.01), elevated circulating platelet-platelet aggregates (P<0.01) and soluble P-selectin levels (P<0.001), and increased platelet responsiveness to adenosine diphosphate and thrombin (both P<0.05). Neither drug influenced these markers of platelet activation at rest or following exercise. Markers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C reactive protein, interleukin-6, tissue necrosis factor-a), coagulation (tissue plasminogen activator antigen, prothrombin fragment F1+2), and endothelial function (von Willebrand factor, soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1) were also uninfluenced by treatment. CONCLUSION: Enalapril and losartan failed to reduce platelet activity both at rest and during exercise in hypertensive patients. Markers of inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial function were similarly unaffected. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system promotes its beneficial effects in hypertension through mechanisms other than platelet inhibition.	0
18581008	Multiple variations of the right renal vessels. Multiple variations of the right renal and testicular vessels were found during routine dissection in a 65-year-old male cadaver. The cadaver was healthy and did not have any other anomalies. The variations found were: presence of three right renal arteries, origin of the right inferior suprarenal artery from the middle right renal artery, two right renal veins, origin of the right testicular artery from the inferior right renal artery and the termination of the right testicular vein into the right renal vein. A sound knowledge of vascular variations in relation to the right kidney and right suprarenal gland is important in kidney transplantation and suprarenal surgery.	0

17313681	Surfactant disaturated-phosphatidylcholine kinetics in acute respiratory distress syndrome by stable isotopes and a two compartment model. BACKGROUND: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), it is well known that only part of the lungs is aerated and surfactant function is impaired, but the extent of lung damage and changes in surfactant turnover remain unclear. The objective of the study was to evaluate surfactant disaturated-phosphatidylcholine turnover in patients with ARDS using stable isotopes. METHODS: We studied 12 patients with ARDS and 7 subjects with normal lungs. After the tracheal instillation of a trace dose of 13C-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, we measured the 13C enrichment over time of palmitate residues of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine isolated from tracheal aspirates. Data were interpreted using a model with two compartments, alveoli and lung tissue, and kinetic parameters were derived assuming that, in controls, alveolar macrophages may degrade between 5 and 50% of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine, the rest being lost from tissue. In ARDS we assumed that 5-100% of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine is degraded in the alveolar space, due to release of hydrolytic enzymes. Some of the kinetic parameters were uniquely determined, while others were identified as lower and upper bounds. RESULTS: In ARDS, the alveolar pool of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine was significantly lower than in controls (0.16 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.31 +/- 0.40 mg/kg, p < 0.05). Fluxes between tissue and alveoli and de novo synthesis of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine were also significantly lower, while mean resident time in lung tissue was significantly higher in ARDS than in controls. Recycling was 16.2 +/- 3.5 in ARDS and 31.9 +/- 7.3 in controls (p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: In ARDS the alveolar pool of surfactant is reduced and disaturated-phosphatidylcholine turnover is altered.	0
20398796	Neurochemical effects of benzodiazepine and morphine on freshwater mussels. The purpose of this study was to examine the neurochemical effects of morphine, diazepam, a common benzodiazepine, and an effluent concentrate on the endemic freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed to the drugs and to the solid-phase concentrate of a municipal effluent and left to stand at 15 degrees C for 48h. Neurochemical effects were determined by monitoring changes in dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the visceral mass (containing the nerve ganglia) of mussels. The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), dopamine and serotonin-dependent adenylyl cyclase (ADC) were also determined in the mussels. Oxidative stress was determined by tracking changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions. The results revealed that the drugs and the effluent extract were biologically active in mussels. Morphine reduced serotonin and increased dopamine in mussel tissues while reducing AChE activity and increasing GABA levels. This suggests the induction of a relaxation state in mussels. Diazepam also reduced serotonin levels but produced no change in dopamine levels. However, dopamine-sensitive ADC activity was readily activated, indicating the potential effect on opiate signaling. Diazepam increased glutamate levels slightly, but AChE remained stable. The increase in both dopamine ADC activity and glutamate concentrations was also associated with greater oxidative stress on the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions in cells. A comparison of the global response pattern of these drugs with those of the effluent extract revealed only a relative proximity to morphine. In conclusion, the data warrant more studies on the analysis of opiates and benzodiazepines in municipal effluents to better address the potential environmental hazard of these neuroactive drug classes to aquatic organisms.	0

18613411	Factors associated with natural seroclearance of hepatitis B surface antigen and prognosis after seroclearance: a prospective follow-up study. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although the natural seroclearance rate of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is reported to be 0.4-2% in western countries, this is not well known in Korea. This study aimed to elucidate the rate of natural HbsAg seroclearance, factors associated with seroclearance and prognosis after seroclearance. METHODOLOGY: In 1999, 250 chronic HBsAg carriers without any history of antiviral treatment and without any evidence of liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma were selected. Follow-up HBsAg/ anti-HBs tests were performed annually till 2004. During a mean follow-up period of 48 months, 24 patients were lost and 11 received antiviral treatment. Finally, 215 patients completed the study. RESULTS: HBsAg seroclearance was observed in 11 patients (6 males, 5 females). One-year seroclearance rate was 1.4%. All patients who achieved seroclearance were HBeAg (-)/HBV DNA (-) at the time of enrollment. Additionally, old age and normal serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level were the factors associated with seroclearance (p < 0.05, respectively). During the follow-up period, only mild transient elevations of ALT were observed in 4 patients and no serious complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Natural seroclearance occurred exclusively in patients who were HBeAg (-)/HBV-DNA (-), and annual rate of natural HBsAg seroclearance was 1.4%. No significant complications were observed after seroclearance.	0
15068857	Influence of polypeptide size and intracellular sorting on the induction of epitope-specific CTL responses by DNA vaccines in a mouse model. We have analysed the influence of size, intracellular localisation, and sorting of various human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-derived Gag and Env polypeptides containing well defined H2(d)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes on the induction of a humoral and cellular immune response after DNA vaccination. Thus, expression vectors were generated based on RNA- and codon-optimised genes encoding (i). budding competent full-length Gag, (ii). a myristylation defect mutant GagMyr(-), (iii). the isolated p24 capsid moiety of Gag as well as variants of these proteins, which were C-terminally fused HIV gp120-derived V3 epitope (R10I), respectively. These constructs were compared to different minitopes each encoding one of the H2(d)-restricted Gag epitopes A9I and E10F or the V3 epitope R10I that were directly linked to the C-terminus of an Ad2-E3 protein-derived ER signal peptide. Immunological evaluation of these constructs in BALB/c mice revealed that both, the budding competent as well as the intracellular Gag proteins were-irrespective of their molecular weights-equally efficient in the priming of Gag-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, the capacity of these constructs to stimulate Gag-specific humoral as well as H2-K(d) and H2-L(d) restricted cellular immune responses was not influenced by C-terminal fusion of the immunodominant H2-D(d) restricted V3 epitope. Chimeric GagV3 polyproteins encoding all three major CTL epitopes within a continuous polyprotein were more efficient to stimulate epitope-specific cellular immune responses than the selected minitopes. In addition, the minitopes failed to induce epitope-specific antibody responses. These results clearly show the advantages of complex polypeptides over minitopes regarding the induction of strong humoral and cellular immune responses.	0
9875338	Select types of supporting cell in the inner ear express aquaporin-4 water channel protein. Aquaporins (AQPs) confer a high water permeability on cell membranes and play important parts in secretory and absorptive epithelia in kidney and other organs. Here we investigate whether AQPs are expressed in the sensory epithelia of the inner ear, where a precise volume regulation is crucial. By use of specific antibodies it was found that the inner ear contains AQP1 and 4 while being devoid of detectable levels of AQP2, 3 or 5. Immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labelling revealed a strictly non-epithelial distribution of AQP1, confirming previous data. In contrast, AQP4 protein and mRNA (visualized by in situ hybridization) were concentrated in select types of supporting cell, including Hensen's cells and inner sulcus cells. Immunogold particles signalling AQP4 were confined to the basolateral plasma membrane of Hensen's cells and to the basal plasma membrane of Claudius cells and inner sulcus cells. AQP4 was also found in supporting cells of the vestibular end organs, but was absent from transitional epithelial cells and dark cells. Strong labelling for AQP4 and AQP4-mRNA was associated with the central part of the cochlear and vestibular nerves. Hair cells were consistently unlabelled. Our findings indicate that AQP4 may facilitate osmotically driven water fluxes in the sensory epithelia of the inner ear and thus contribute to the volume and ion homeostasis at these sites.	0
24426008	Optimization of process variables for instant preparation of neyyappam like product and extension of shelf-life. Neyyappam is a very popular traditional sweet of Kerala and Tamilnadu. It is prepared from soaked rice (10-12  h) and had limited shelf-life. Response surface methodology was adopted to optimize, the levels of variables i.e. jaggery, baking powder and holding time based on quantity of rice with selected responses i.e. hardness, bulk density and overall acceptability. All the three variables i.e. jaggery, baking powder and holding time had negative effect (p    <=   0.05) on hardness at linear level. Bulk density was also negatively affected (p    <=   0.05) by jaggery and baking powder. However, the overall acceptability was positively affected (p    <=   0.05) by jaggery and baking powder. It was recommended to use jaggery 90  g/100  g rice flour, baking powder 1.5  g/100  g rice flour and holding time of 13.0  min. Optimized samples were packed in polyethylene pouches, heat treated in a cabinet dryer at 90  C for 2  h, stored under ambient temperature conditions along with control and monitored for peroxide value, free fatty acids and thiobarbutyric acid values as well as microbiological, sensory and textural changes. It was observed that control samples had visible yeast and mould growth at 3rd day, while the treated ones remained highly acceptable up to 30  days with respect to chemical, textural, sensory and microbiological changes.	0
20675952	Increasing HIV-related knowledge, communication, and testing intentions among Latinos: Protege tu Familia: Hazte la Prueba. Latinos are less likely to be aware of their HIV seropositivity than African Americans and Whites. 'Protege tu Familia: Hazte la Prueba' is a culturally and linguistically-sensitive HIV/AIDS prevention and testing program targeting Latino families. Using community-based participatory research techniques, Spanish-speaking bicultural community health workers helped develop and then used an educational flip chart and materials to conduct outreach and HIV prevention education in diverse settings. The intervention was created to increase HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, to improve communication regarding sexual risk, and to augment intentions to use condoms and test for HIV. A secondary purpose was to decrease HIV-related stigma by improving knowledge about transmission and reducing homophobia. Participants demonstrated significant increases in HIV knowledge, intention to practice safer sex and communicate sexual risk to partner(s), and intention to test for HIV. Improvements were also found in self-reported comfort levels when interacting with and caring for the HIV positive, thus decreasing HIV/AIDS-related stigma.	0
15684518	Discovery of a novel and potent human and rat beta3-adrenergic receptor agonist, [3-[(2R)-[[(2R)-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-1H-indol-7-yloxy]acetic acid. In search for potent and selective beta3-adrenergic receptor (beta3-AR) agonists as potential drugs for the treatment of type II diabetes and obesity, a novel series of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-aminoethanol derivatives were prepared and evaluated for their biological activity at human beta1-, beta2-, and beta3-ARs and rat beta3-AR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Replacement of the right-hand side (RHS, benzene ring) in the 'first generation' beta3-AR agonists BRL 37344 and CL 316243 with a 1H-indole ring gave compound 31 with unique pharmacological properties among beta3-AR agonists. Initial in vitro assays showed that 31 possesses modest rat and human beta3-ARs agonistic activity. Introduction of various substituent into the indole nucleus of 31 afforded a number of compounds with good beta3-ARs agonistic activity. In particular, 90 having a carboxylic acid functionality at the 7-position of the indole nucleus showed the most potent human beta3-AR agonistic activity. Finally, optical resolution of 90 led to the identification of the most promising compound, [3-[(2R)-[[(2R)-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-1H-indol-7-yloxy]acetic acid (96, AJ-9677). This compound exhibited potent human beta3-AR agonistic activity (EC50=0.062 nM, IA=116%) with 210- and 103-fold selectivity over human beta2-AR and beta1-AR, respectively. Compound 96 also exhibited potent rat beta3-AR agonistic activity (EC50=0.016 nM, IA=110%). Moreover, repeated oral administration of 96 inhibited body weight gain and significantly decreased glucose, insulin, free fatty acid, and triglyceride concentrations in plasma in KK-Ay/Ta mice. On the basis of this pharmacological profile, 96 entered clinical development as a drug for the treatment of type II diabetes and obesity.	0
9239558	A method to quantify the fiber kinematics of planar tissues under biaxial stretch. We have developed a method for measuring fiber kinematics in two-dimensional soft collagenous tissues. The technique combines small-angle light scattering (SALS) and biaxial stretch controlled by simultaneous optical strain measurement. Preliminary findings on porcine aortic valve leaflets and bovine pericardium indicate that fiber kinematics are highly tissue specific and are generally non-affine. The mobility of the fibers within each tissue seems to be specialized to perform a distinct physiological function. Quantitative knowledge of a tissue's angular fiber distribution and its transformation during biaxial stretch is critical for microstructural modeling of planar tissues. Our results underscore the importance of measuring fiber kinematics for each specific tissue type that is to be modeled.	0
11421692	Edge-bridged octahedral tungsten-oxygen-chlorine clusters: synthesis and characterization of two D(3d)-symmetric [W(6)O(6)Cl(12)](2-) isomers and [W(6)O(7)Cl(11)](3-). Initial access to the chemistry of hexanuclear tungsten oxohalide clusters is provided through the reduction of WOCl(4) with bismuth metal at 360 degrees C. Reactions targeting W(6)O(6)Cl(10) produce an amorphous black solid, which, upon treatment with concentrated aqueous HCl, releases the edge-bridged octahedral cluster [alpha-W(6)O(6)Cl(12)](2-) into solution. The cluster exhibits a D(3d)-symmetry structure in which the six oxygen atoms bridge the edges between two opposing triangular faces of a trigonally compressed W(6) octahedron. Reactions incorporating additional bismuth metal yield a mixture of soluble clusters, including a 5:7 ratio of [alpha-W(6)O(6)Cl(12)](2-) and another D(3d)-symmetry isomer, [beta-W(6)O(6)Cl(12)](2-). The latter species displays a different core structure, in which the six oxygen atoms are situated on the edges comprising two opposing triangular faces of a trigonally elongated W(6) octahedron. Isolated as the BuN(+) salts, the two isomers can be separated by a process relying on the differences in crystal morphology. Cyclic voltammetry of acetonitrile solutions shows two reversible one-electron reductions for each cluster, the alpha isomer being slightly more easily reduced. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the two isomers of [W(6)O(6)Cl(12)](2-) are nearly identical in energy, with the beta isomer lying just 1.4 kcal/mol below the alpha isomer. The other major product isolated from the reaction with additional bismuth is [W(6)O(7)Cl(11)](3-), a cluster at least formally related to [beta-W(6)O(6)Cl(12)](2-) by substitution of an O(2)(-) ion for a core Cl(-) ion. In acetonitrile solution, this cluster displays a single reversible one-electron reduction. It is anticipated that the reactions elaborated here will lead to a general method for synthesizing metastable metal oxohalide clusters.	0

8851035	[Toxocariasis. A cosmopolitan parasitic zoonosis]. The infection by Toxocara canis transmitted by dogs (30% of them are infected in our countries) and less frequently by cats lead to larva migrans visceral syndrome with neurological manifestations, ophtalmological affection and various cutaneous manifestations observed in 24% of the extra-ocular infections: chronic urticaria often associated with asthmatic manifestations and chronic rhinitis, angio-oedema or local oedema reaching particularly the eyclid, chronic pruritus associated with lesions due to scratching or to nodular prurigo. An hypereosinophilia is an argument in favour of a progressive infection. High total IgE is an hallmark of visceral infections by parasites and total IgE level is well correlated with the presence of intra-tissular larva. The serological diagnosis is based on the determination of specific IgG by ELISA which appears also to be interesting for the patient's follow up. The western blot method seems to be more specific than the other methods and so is useful to confirm a diagnosis. The treatment given as early as possible is based on the use of diethylcarbamazine but also of thiabendazole, albendazole and mebendazole. Prophylaxis of toxocara infection includes the prohibition of dog access to children games areas but also a frequent turn over of the sand in public parks.	0
9301080	Light-responsive elements of the tobacco PSI-D gene are located both upstream and within the transcribed region. psaDb is a nuclear gene encoding the ferredoxin-binding subunit of photosystem I in Nicotiana sylvestris. The organization of the light-responsive cis-elements of psaDb was studied using transgenic tobacco plants. Three types of psaDb chimeric constructs were created: (1) a 5' upstream fragment of psaDb transcriptionally fused with the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene, and a series of its 5' deletion derivatives, (2) the transcribed region of psaDb driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, and (3) the 5' terminal 35 bases (the entire leader, +1 to +23, and the initiation codon context, +24 to +35) of the psaDb mRNA translationally fused with a GUS reporter gene under the operation of the CaMV 35S promoter. Light-responsiveness of these fusions in transgenic plants was examined by GUS assay and primer extension analysis. The results indicate that the light-responsive elements (LRE) of psaDb are located both upstream (-170 to +24) and within (+1 to +861) the transcribed region. The internal LRE is utilized in etiolated seedings but not in green leaves. The leader and initiation codon context construct (+1 to +35) did not show any light-response under the conditions tested. Therefore, it is likely that a combination of the upstream and internal LREs generates the complex light-responsive and tissue-specific regulation of this gene. This study also revealed that psaDb has adjacent activator (-267 to -254) and repressor (-253 to -234) regions for basal transcriptional activity; the former contains the ACGT binding motif recognized by many plant bZIP proteins, and the latter has the R3 decamer motif found in several photosystem I-related genes.	0
21765527	Observation of coherence between two independent atomic ensembles by Raman scattering. By using spontaneous Raman processes in the high-gain regime, we create instantaneous coherence between two independent atomic ensembles. The coherence is confirmed by the observation of temporal beating between the two subsequent readout fields converted from the atomic excitations through another enhanced Raman process. The beat frequency is found to be a result of an AC Stark frequency shift effect. We find that, due to the spontaneous nature of the process, the phases of the two ensembles change from one realization to another even though there is good coherence for a single realization.	0

10418992	Progestins in the menopause. While the benefits of progestin use in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are well recognised as far as endometrial protection is concerned, their risks and drawbacks have generated controversial articles. The data related to the progestin effect on breast tissue has been interpreted differently from country to country. However it has been admitted that, according to the type of progestin used, the dose and duration of its application, a predominant antiproliferative effect is observed in the human breast cells. As far as breast cancer risk is concerned, most epidemiological studies do not suggest any difference between the estrogens given alone or combined to progestins in HRT. When the cardiovascular risk factors are considered, some molecules with a higher androgenic potency than others, attenuate the beneficial effects of estrogens on the lipid profile and the vasomotion as well. On the other hand, other progestins devoid of androgenic properties do not exert these deleterious effects. The epidemiological data does not suggest any negative effect of the progestins administered together with estrogens on cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. However, recent results suggest that in women with established coronary heart disease (CHD), HRT may not protect against further heart attacks, when the progestin selected possesses androgenic properties. Complying with the classic contra indications of HRT and selecting molecules devoid of estrogenic, androgenic, or glucocorticoid effect should allow a larger use of the progestins without any major drawback.	0
9101626	Psychometric properties of a brief self-report Type A questionnaire for use in primary health care. OBJECTIVE: To develop a short and easily used self-report measure of Type A behaviour (Simplified Type A Questionnaire = STAQ) and to examine its capacity to predict Type A behaviour as assessed by more time-consuming measures. DESIGN: A Videotaped Structured Interview (VSI) and a self-report measure, previously validated in Sweden, were used as comparison instruments to the STAQ. SETTING: Primary health care. PATIENTS: 206 (81 men and 125 women) aged 17-75 years attending a health centre during one year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The reliability, measured by Cronbach's alpha and split-half correlation. The specificity and sensitivity of the STAQ. The correlaiton between the STAQ and the two other diagnostic measures. RESULTS: The reliability of the STAQ was 0.70 and 0.75, respectively. The specificity was 83% and the sensitivity 75%. The correlation between the STAQ and the VSI was 0.45. The correlation between the STAQ and the previously validated self-report was 0.61. CONCLUSIONS: The STAQ has good psychometric properties and, in comparison with other diagnostic measurement instruments in medical service, it has an acceptable discrimination capacity.	0

9013544	Activation of the nuclear receptor LXR by oxysterols defines a new hormone response pathway. Accumulation of cholesterol causes both repression of genes controlling cholesterol biosynthesis and cellular uptake and induction of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, which leads to the removal of cholesterol by increased metabolism to bile acids. Here, we report that LXRalpha and LXRbeta, two orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, are activated by 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol at physiologic concentrations. In addition, we have identified an LXR response element in the promoter region of the rat cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene. Our data provide evidence for a new hormonal signaling pathway that activates transcription in response to oxysterols and suggest that LXRs play a critical role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.	1

17994149	Anticaries potential of commercial dentifrices as determined by fluoridation and remineralization efficiency. AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate fluoride uptake in human enamel after use of commercially available toothpastes containing different fluoride compounds, or combinations of fluoride actives formulated into a single product, as a means of determining the efficiency of each formula for delivering caries preventing fluoride to demineralized (caries active) enamel. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four test dentifrices and two controls were assessed and placed in groups as follows: Group 1: Lacer (Spain); Group 2: Positive control-USP Reference Standard 1100 ppm F; Group 3: Fluocaril Bi-Fluor   250 (France); Group 4: Colgate Fluor Active (Denmark); Group 5: Elmex (France); and Group 6: A placebo (formulated the same as the USP Reference Standard toothpaste with the exception that it contained < 1 ppm F). Cores 3 mm in diameter were removed from erupted human enamel specimens (extracted by local oral surgeons for orthodontic reasons) and stored in 1% Thymol solution prior to use. They were ground and polished to remove the natural fluoride rich enamel layer, then exposed to a demineralization solution, and assessed for surface microhardness to enable randomization for use in the study. Each group of five specimens underwent a daily pH cycling procedure that involved exposure to pooled human saliva (refreshed three times daily). The groups were then exposed to dentifrice slurries four times daily for one minute per exposure and to a demineralization solution for three hours. The cycling procedure was repeated for five days. Specimens were again analyzed for surface microhardness and fluoride uptake upon completion of five days of treatment. RESULTS: Average surface hardness: Groups 2 and 3 showed a statistically significant greater (p<0.05) change indicating greater remineralization compared to all other groups. The average change was 23.45 for Group 2 and 22.65 for Group 3. All other groups had changes ranging from 4.25-8.62. No other statistically significant differences were observed between groups. Fluoride uptake results: Groups 2 and 3 showed statistically significantly greater fluoride uptake versus all other groups (p<0.05). Groups 1 and 5 were significantly different from Group 6. No other statistically significant differences were observed for either analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Of the marketed products included in the study, the Fluocaril Bi-Fluor   250 product formulation provided both the highest level of fluoride uptake and mineralization to the demineralized enamel. The clinical significance of these in vitro results is the confirmation Fluocaril Bi-Fluor   250 is effective at remineralizing enamel caries lesions.	0
9934743	Symptoms and physiology in severe chronic constipation. OBJECTIVE: Symptoms of constipation have been attributed to slow colon transit, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD). Our aim was to determine the existence of symptom-based constipation subgroups and whether these correspond to differences in colonic transit and anorectal sensorimotor function. METHODS: Constipated patients (n = 108) completed questionnaires, and underwent colon transit studies, anorectal manometry, and rectal sensory testing. Factor analysis of symptoms was performed. Factor-based symptom scores were correlated with physiological findings. RESULTS: Three symptom factors were identified as compatible with slow colonic transit, IBS, and PFD. There was a significant correlation between the symptoms of slow transit and total and rectosigmoid colon transit. There were also significant correlations between both the IBS symptom score and the number of Manning criteria with measures of rectal hypersensitivity typical of IBS. Neither PFD symptom scores nor symptoms of straining correlated with any electromyographic or manometric measure of anal defecatory function or with rectosigmoid colon transit. Based on physiological testing patients were classified as slow transit, visceral hypersensitivity (typical of IBS), PFD, or no abnormalities found. As expected, slow-transit patients had symptoms of infrequent stools and patients with visceral hypersensitivity had an increased number of Manning criteria for IBS. Patients with PFD physiology and those with no detectable abnormalities had no specific symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Three symptom-based subgroups for constipation were confirmed: slow transit, IBS, and PFD. Slow transit and IBS symptoms correlated with expected physiology. Conversely, PFD symptoms and physiology did not correlate.	0

In mature B lymphocytes, the zinc finger transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr-1) is one of the many immediate-early genes induced upon B cell antigen receptor engagement. However, its role during earlier stages of lymphopoiesis has remained unclear. By examining bone marrow B cell subsets, we found Egr-1 transcripts in pro/pre-B and immature B lymphocytes, and Egr-1 protein in pro/pre-B-I cells cultivated on stroma cells in the presence of interleukin (IL)-7. In recombinase-activating gene (RAG)-2-deficient mice overexpressing an Egr-1 transgene in the B lymphocyte lineage, pro/pre-B-I cells could differentiate past a developmental block at the B220(low) BP-1(-) stage to the stage of B220(low) BP-1(+) pre-B-I cells, but not further to the B220(low) BP-1(+) CD25(+) stage of pre-B-II cells. Therefore, during early B lymphopoiesis progression from the B220(low) BP-1(-) IL-2R- pro/pre-B-I stage to the B220(low) BP-1(+) IL-2R+ pre-B-II stage seems to occur in at least two distinct steps, and the first step to the stage of B220(low) BP-1(+) pre-B-I cells can be promoted by the overexpression of Egr-1 alone. Wild-type mice expressing an Egr-1 transgene had increased proportions of mature immunoglobulin (Ig)M+ B220(high) and decreased proportions of immature IgM+ B220(low) bone marrow B cells. Since transgenic and control precursor B cells show comparable proliferation patterns, overexpression of Egr-1 seems also to promote entry into the mature B cell stage. Analysis of changes in the expression pattern of potential Egr-1 target genes revealed that Egr-1 enhances the expression of the aminopeptidase BP-1/6C3 in pre-B and immature B cells and upregulates expression of the orphan nuclear receptor nur77 in IgM+ B cells.	1
15281278	[pRB, p53, p16INK4a, senescence and malignant transformation]. Recent works aimed at clarifying the respective roles of p16INKa and p14ARF (both located on the same INK4a locus on chromosome 9p21 in man) in malignant transformation come to the conclusion that p16INK4a is the true tumor suppressor gene in man. In mouse, it is the p19ARF knockout that suppresses the barrier protecting cells from malignant transformation. This situation is in agreement with p19ARF- and p16-mediated senescence induced by oncogenic mutated ras (Ras*) in mouse and man respectively. Other results have shown that senescence in human diploid fibroblasts is associated with heterochromatin occurrence that maintains in repressed state E2F1-induced gens required for G1 to S phases transition. Since RB protein is responsible for this chromatin modification, cells with any impaired RB pathway cannot enter into senescence.	0
14962646	The common variants/multiple disease hypothesis of common complex genetic disorders. Unlike simple rare Mendelian disorders, the genetic basis for common disorders is unclear. A general model of the genetics of common complex disorders is proposed which emphasizes the shared nature of common alleles in related common disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Type II diabetes and obesity, and among autoimmune diseases. This model, the common variants/multiple disease hypothesis, emphasizes that many disease genes may not be disease specific. Common deleterious alleles, found at a relatively high frequency in the population may play a role in related clinical phenotypes in the context of different genetic backgrounds and under different environmental conditions.	0
11949145	The experiences and perceptions of nursing service managers regarding transformation of health services in selected provincial academic health complexes. Nursing service managers are challenged with enormous transformations within the new political dispensation in South Africa. The objective of the study was to explore and describe the experiences and perceptions of the nursing service managers regarding transformation of health services in selected Provincial Academic Health Complexes. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and phenomenological design was employed utilising focus group interviews and narratives as methods of data collection. After content analysis was performed, results were grouped into management of health service transformation and quality of patient care in relation to the levels of the organisation. The levels in the organisation are individual level, group level, departmental level and organisational level. Positive and negative experiences and perceptions were identified.	0
7911341	Flow cytometry of blood and bone marrow cells from patients with hairy cell leukemia: phenotype of hairy cells and lymphocyte subsets after treatment with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. By flow cytometry and an extensive set of markers, we characterized leukemic cells from the blood and bone marrow of 68 symptomatic patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Hairy cells identified in the large cell gate always expressed CD19, CD20, HLA-DR, CD45RA, and B-ly 7. Other markers were occasionally expressed, such as CD38, CD45RO, CD23, CD15, CD4, CD5, and CD10 (expressed on more than 20% of the hairy cells in 44%, 25%, 21%, 18%, 12%, 10%, and 5% of evaluated cases, respectively). During treatment with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA), the median lymphocyte counts decreased from 2,000/microL to 300/microL. Flow cytometry was repeated at the nadir (n = 24) of lymphocyte counts, at 3 months (n = 46), at 6 months (n = 50), at 1 year (n = 39), and at 2 years (n = 12) after treatment. The initial decrease of CD8+ and CD20+ cells was greater than that of CD4+ and natural killer (NK) cells, leading to an increasing CD4/CD8 ratio. Median nadir values of CD4+, CD8+, CD20+, and NK cells were 128/microL, 78/microL, 10/microL, and 13/microL, respectively. The subsequent recovery was quicker for CD8+ and NK cells, leading to a normalization within 3 months, whereas CD20+ and CD4+ cells required 1 or 2 years to enter the normal range. The CD4/CD8 ratio thus decreased after the nadir and remained less than 1. CD45RA+ CD4 cells and CD45RA+/CD45RO+ double-positive cells were less affected by CdA. Activated T cells, ie, HLA-DR+ cells, rarely decreased below the normal range and often recovered with an overshoot. CD10+ cells increased in the bone marrow posttreatment as an indication of normal B-cell regeneration in 16 of 36 (44%) patients. The quick regeneration of certain lymphoid subsets might explain the lack of late infections in CdA-treated HCL patients.	0
19718722	A small molecule affecting the replication of trinucleotide repeat d(GAA)n. A newly designed ligand, methylcarbamoylnaphthyridine dimer (MCND), was synthesized and characterized. Ligand binding to d(GAA)(10) was investigated by UV thermal denaturation, circular dichroism spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, and cold-spray-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The results indicated that MCND bound to the d(GAA)(n) repeat to form a stable hairpin structure with a major binding stoichiometry of 3:1. The most likely binding site was identified as the G-G mismatch in the AGA/AGA triad. The polymerase stop assay showed that MCND binding to the d(GAA)(n) repeat effectively interfered with the extension of the primer at the first two GAA sites on the template with both prokaryotic Taq DNA polymerase and human DNA polymerase alpha.	0
22676418	Galacto-oligosaccharide synthesis from lactose solution or skim milk using the b-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans. The synthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) catalyzed by a novel commercial preparation of b-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans (Biolactase) was studied, and the products were characterized by MS and NMR. Using 400 g/L lactose and 1.5 enzyme units per milliliter, the maximum GOS yield, measured by HPAEC-PAD analysis, was 165 g/L (41% w/w of total carbohydrates in the mixture). The major transgalactosylation products were the trisaccharide Gal-b(1 > 4)-Gal-b(1 > 4)-Glc and the tetrasaccharide Gal-b(1 > 4)-Gal-b(1 > 4)-Gal-b(1 > 4)-Glc. The GOS yield increased to 198 g/L (49.4% w/w of total carbohydrates) using a higher enzyme concentration (15 U/mL), which minimized the enzyme inactivation under reaction conditions. Using skim milk (with a lactose concentration of 46 g/L), the enzyme also displayed transgalactosylation activity: maximum GOS yield accounted for 15.4% (7.1 g/L), which was obtained at 50% lactose conversion.	0
16940180	Luman/CREB3 induces transcription of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response protein Herp through an ER stress response element. Luman/CREB3 (also called LZIP) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound transcription factor which is believed to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis in response to cellular cues. We previously found that Luman activates transcription from the unfolded protein response element. Here we report the identification of Herp, a gene involved in ER stress-associated protein degradation (ERAD), as a direct target of Luman. We found that Luman was transcriptionally induced and proteolytically activated by the ER stress inducer thaspsigargin. Overexpression of Luman activated transcription of cellular Herp via ER stress response element II (ERSE-II; ATTGG-N-CCACG) in the promoter region. Mutagenesis studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Luman physically associates with the Herp promoter, specifically the second half-site (CCACG) of ERSE-II. Luman was also necessary for the full activation of Herp during the ER stress response, since Luman small interfering RNA knockdown or functional repression by a dominant negative mutant attenuated Herp gene expression. Like Herp, overexpression of Luman protected cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis. With Luman structurally similar to ATF6 but resembling XBP1 in DNA-binding specificities, we propose that Luman is a novel factor that plays a role in ERAD and a converging point for various signaling pathways channeling through the ER.	1
6644014	Allomonads - a new group of microorganisms of the Vibrionaceae family. A total of 24 strains of microorganisms with basic marks relating them to the family of Vibrionaceae were isolated from human faeces, liquid sewage and waters of surface reservoirs contaminated with sewage. The study of biological, cultural and biochemical characteristics, determination of phenotypic similarity according to Adanson-Sneath, investigation of DNA composition and extent of DNA hybridization by the methods of gene taxonomy induced us to establish taxonomic independence of the discovered strains at the level of the genus Allomonas gen. nov. with so far the only species A. enterica sp. nov.	0
8103960	Deletions on the long arm of chromosome 17 in pilocytic astrocytoma. Pilocytic astrocytomas are the most common astrocytic tumors of childhood and differ clinically and histopathologically from those astrocytomas that affect adults. Studies of adult astrocytic tumors have revealed allelic losses on chromosomes 10, 17p, 19q and alterations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. We have previously examined pilocytic astrocytomas for allelic losses on chromosomes 10 and 19q and for amplification of the EGFR gene, but did not detect genomic alterations at these loci. In the present study we assayed 20 pilocytic astrocytomas for loss of allelic heterozygosity of chromosome 17p, including one locus in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. In addition, because pilocytic astrocytomas frequently affect patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and the NF1 gene has been mapped to 17q11.2, we also examined multiple loci on the long arm of chromosome 17. Allelic loss was observed on chromosome 17 in four cases (three sporadic, one NF1); all lost portions of the long arm in chromosome 17, and one tumor lost the short arm as well. One tumor showed an interstitial deletion on the long arm that included the region of the NF1 gene. These data suggest the presence of a tumor suppressor gene on 17q that is associated with pilocytic astrocytomas. A potential candidate for this gene is the NF1 tumor suppressor gene.	0

23764322	A novel use of the facial artery based buccinator musculo-mucosal island flap for reconstruction of the oropharynx. The buccinator musculo-mucosal island or Zhao flap can be used to reconstruct a wide range of intra-oral defects including floor of mouth, tonsillar fossa and lateral tongue. We describe our experience with the inferiorly based facial artery buccinator musculo-mucosal flap for a novel use in the reconstruction of oropharyngeal tumours at the tongue base and lateral pharyngeal wall. We prospectively reviewed all patients who underwent buccinator musculo-mucosal island flap reconstruction examining indication, operative details, and post-operative outcomes. We describe our technique for its novel use in lateral pharynx/tongue base reconstruction through neck dissection access. Deeper flaps were adequately visualised and monitored using flexible nasoendoscopy. There were no flap failures with all patients achieving primary healing with minimal complications. All donor sites closed directly with minimal scarring. Two patients reported mild tightness on mouth opening and two patients reported transient weakness of the mandibular branch of the facial nerve. In our experience the buccinator musculo-mucosal island flap is an extremely versatile 'like for like' local flap option due to its long arc of rotation. As inset can be achieved via neck dissection access, this avoids lip/jaw split as per conventional oropharyngeal surgical management further minimising morbidity. We present the first series of its effective use in oropharyngeal reconstruction.	0
20102160	The basic helix-loop-helix region of human neurogenin 1 is a monomeric natively unfolded protein which forms a \"fuzzy\" complex upon DNA binding. Neuronal specification is regulated by the activity of transcription factors containing the basic helix-loop-helix motif (bHLH); these regulating proteins include, among others, the neurogenin (Ngn) family, related to the atonal family of genes. Neurogenin 1 (NGN1) is a 237-residue protein that contains a bHLH domain and is involved in neuronal differentiation. In this work, we synthesized the bHLH region of NGN1 (bHLHN) comprising residues 90-150 of the full-length NGN1. The domain is a monomeric natively unfolded protein with a pH-dependent premolten globule conformation, as shown by several spectroscopic techniques (namely, NMR, fluorescence, FTIR, and circular dichroism). The unfolded character of the domain also explains, first, the impossibility of its overexpression in several Escherichia coli strains and, second, its insolubility in aqueous buffers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first extensive study of the conformational preferences of a bHLH domain under different solution conditions. Upon binding to two DNA E-boxes, the protein forms \"fuzzy\" complexes (that is, the complexes were not fully folded). The affinities of bHLHN for both DNA boxes were smaller than those of other bHLH domains, which might explain why the protein-DNA complexes were not fully folded.	0
15376688	Frequent word section extraction in a presentation speech by an effective dynamic programming algorithm. Word frequency in a document has often been utilized in text searching and summarization. Similarly, identifying frequent words or phrases in a speech data set for searching and summarization would also be meaningful. However, obtaining word frequency in a speech data set is difficult, because frequent words are often special terms in the speech and cannot be recognized by a general speech recognizer. This paper proposes another approach that is effective for automatic extraction of such frequent word sections in a speech data set. The proposed method is applicable to any domain of monologue speech, because no language models or specific terms are required in advance. The extracted sections can be regarded as speech labels of some kind or a digest of the speech presentation. The frequent word sections are determined by detecting similar sections, which are sections of audio data that represent the same word or phrase. The similar sections are detected by an efficient algorithm, called Shift Continuous Dynamic Programming (Shift CDP), which realizes fast matching between arbitrary sections in the reference speech pattern and those in the input speech, and enables frame-synchronous extraction of similar sections. In experiments, the algorithm is applied to extract the repeated sections in oral presentation speeches recorded in academic conferences in Japan. The results show that Shift CDP successfully detects similar sections and identifies the frequent word sections in individual presentation speeches, without prior domain knowledge, such as language models and terms.	0
20107561	Analytical Applications of Reactions of Iron(III) and Hexacyanoferrate(III) with 2,10-Disubstituted Phenothiazines. The presented review is devoted to analytical applications of reactions of Fe(III) and K(3)[Fe(CN)(6)] with 2,10-disubstituted phenothiazines (PT). It was found that iron(III) and hexacyanoferrate(III) ions in acidic media easily oxidized PT with the formation of colored oxidation products. This property has been exploited for spectrophotometric determination of iron(III) ions and phenothiazines. Some flow-injection procedures of the determination of PT based on the oxidation reaction by means of the above-mentioned oxidants have been proposed. In the presented review, the application of 2,10-disubstituted phenothiazines as indicators in complexometric titration of iron(III) as well as procedures of PT determination based on generation of ternary compound in the system Fe(III)-SCN(-)- PT was also described.	0

12937444	The Bactericidal And Cytotoxic Effects Of Antimicrobial Wound Cleansers. OBJECTIVE: Wound care is a part of daily activity for many athletic trainers. Knowing which cleansers are effective against the bacteria that most commonly cause infection and whether they are toxic to healthy cells enables athletic trainers to make educated decisions on which cleanser to use. We compared the bactericidal effectiveness and cytotoxicity to human fibroblast cells of 4 cleansers at various dilutions. DESIGN AND SETTING: A 4 x 4 factorial design was used for the cytotoxicity testing. The independent variables were type and dilution of cleanser. The dependent variable was cell viability of the human fibroblast cells. We used a 2 x 3 x 4 x 4 factorial design for the bacterial testing. The independent variables were type and dilution of bacteria and type and dilution of cleanser. The dependent variable was the bactericidal action of the cleanser on the bacteria. SUBJECTS: Human foreskin samples were used to obtain a line of fibroblast cells. Bacterial samples were obtained from an athletic training clinic, isolated from swabs of a whirlpool water supply valve (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or skin surface (Staphylococcus aureus). MEASUREMENTS: We obtained bactericidal measurements by testing isolated Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Minimum and maximum concentrations were identified according to bactericidal effectiveness. Cytotoxicity measurements were obtained from spectrophotometer readings of a neutral red assay for fibroblast cell viability. Final dilutions tested were determined by pilot testing. RESULTS: At the 1:5 dilution of product in sterile 0.9% saline, both Cinder Suds and Nitrotan and hydrogen peroxide were different from the control with regard to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At the 1:10 dilution, both Betadine and hydrogen peroxide were different from the control with regard to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These 2 cleansers were also different from each other. At the 1:10 dilution, only Betadine was not different from the control for the cytotoxicity testing. CONCLUSIONS: Betadine was both effective against bacteria and not harmful to human fibroblast cells at a 1:10 dilution of a commercially purchased solution.	0
10959046	Adhesion-linked kinases in cancer; emphasis on src, focal adhesion kinase and PI 3-kinase. Our understanding of the complex signal transduction pathways involved in signalling within cancer cells, between cancer cells and between cancer cells and their environment has increased dramatically in recent years. Here we concentrate on three non-receptor kinases: Src, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). These form part of a complex network of intracellular signals which is thought to be important in regulating cancer cells.	0
9398290	Mapping the suramin-binding sites of human neutrophil elastase: investigation by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and molecular modeling. Neutrophil elastase (NE), a mediator of inflammation, binds with high affinity numerous anionic molecules including suramin, a polysulfated naphthylurea, which inhibits it with a Ki of 0.2 microM and a 4:1 suramin:NE stoichiometry and thus constitutes a potential therapeutic agent. In an attempt to locate the suramin molecules on NE, we investigated the NE-suramin interaction using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The time-resolved intensity decay of NE, a protein with three Trp residues, in positions 27, 141, and 237 (chymotrypsin numbering system) was best described by a three-exponential function with lifetimes ranging from 0.22 to 2.28 ns. Comparison of the accessibility of the three lifetime classes to the fluorescence quenchers acrylamide and iodide with the computed solvent accessibility of the three Trp residues in the crystal structure of NE indicates that the main, if not the sole, contribution to the 2.28 ns lifetime class is brought about by the fully buried Trp 141 residue. The addition of suramin to NE induces a sharp decrease in NE fluorescence and a corresponding increase in suramin fluorescence due to an efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Trp residues of NE, acting as donors, and the naphthalene rings of suramin, behaving as acceptors. From the fate of the longest lifetime class in the presence of variable suramin concentrations, we deduce that two suramins are bound at less than 17 A from Trp 141, whereas the two others are located at least 29 A from Trp 141. Moreover, neither the binding of suramin to NE nor the FRET process was modified when NE was complexed with a peptide chloromethylketone inhibitor, suggesting that suramin does not directly interfere with the substrate binding site of NE. These data were used as constraints to model the NE-suramin complex.	0
22219172	Drinking patterns, psychological distress and quality of life in a Norwegian general population-based sample. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate possible relationships between drinking patterns, psychological distress and quality of life (QoL) in a general population-based sample in Norway. METHODS: A random sample of 4,000 Norwegian citizens, aged 18 to 79, was drawn from the National Register held by Statistics Norway. RESULTS: Males consumed significantly more alcohol and reported more drinking-related problems with more negative consequences, compared to females. Psychological distress increased, and all QoL domain scores decreased with increasing alcohol consumption within the group drinking alcohol at all. The excessive drinkers demonstrated the highest level of psychological distress and lowest QoL in the psychological, social relationships and environment domains. Non-drinkers reported to have poorest QoL in the physical health domain, whereas light and moderate drinkers demonstrated lowest psychological distress and best QoL. Psychological distress demonstrated substantial more importance for QoL than socio-demographic variables, alcohol consumption, alcohol dependency and negative consequences of alcohol use did. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the need for a focus on psychological distress and its negative impact upon all QoL domains. Attention should also be paid to excessive drinkers who have poor QoL (psychological, social relationships and environment domains) and a high level of psychological distress. In addition, non-drinkers reported poor physical health. Further research is needed concerning the relation between alcohol consumption, psychological distress and QoL both in general population studies and in more specific samples.	0
9914941	Osteoinduction by demineralised bone. Bone contains several growth factors, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic and acidic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF and aFGF). The BMPs are the only factors known to provoke bone formation heterotopically by making undifferentiated mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts (osteoinduction). Much of our knowledge of osteoinduction derives from studies in rodents of heterotopically implanted demineralised bone which contains various growth factors, including BMPs. This model has been used to examine the effect on osteoinduction of different factors, including the type of host soft tissue, age and species of donor and recipient, demineralisation procedure, storage and sterilisation procedures, experimental diabetes, dietary factors, hormones, growth factors, caffeine, biphosphonates, indomethacin and biomaterials. Demineralised bone enhances bone formation experimentally in various animal models, including cranio-maxillofacial reconstructions, healing of diaphyseal defects, and spinal fusion; demineralised bone has also been used in a limited way clinically. However, sufficient osteoinduction in humans may require a higher concentration of BMPs and other growth factors than those found in demineralised bone.	0
21334783	[Left-sided endocarditis due to gram-negative bacilli: epidemiology and clinical characteristics]. INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and outcome of patients with left-side endocarditis caused by gram-negative bacteria. METHOD: Prospective multicenter study of left-sided infective endocarditis reported in the Andalusian Cohort for the Study of Cardiovascular Infections between 1984 and 2008. RESULTS: Among the 961 endocarditis, 24 (2.5%) were caused by gram-negative bacilli. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica. Native valves (85.7%) were mainly affected, most of them with previous valve damage (57%). Comorbidity was greater (90% vs 39%; P=.05) than in endocarditis due to other microorganism, the most frequent being, diabetes, hepatic cirrhosis and neoplasm. A previous manipulation was found in 47.6% of the cases, and 37% were considered hospital-acquired. Renal failure (41%), central nervous system involvement (33%) and ventricular dysfunction (45%) were the most frequent complications. Five cases (21%) required cardiac surgery, mostly due to ventricular dysfunction. More than 50% of cases were treated with aminoglycosides, but this did not lead to a better outcome or prognosis. Mortality (10 patients) was higher than that reported with other microorganisms (41% vs 35%; P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: Left-sided endocarditis due to gram-negative bacilli is a rare disease, which affects patients with major morbidities and often with a previous history of hospital manipulations. Cardiac, neurological and renal complications are frequent and associated with a high mortality. The association of aminoglycosides in the antimicrobial treatment did not involve a better outcome or prognosis.	0
20550405	Direct determination of fluid-solid coexistence of square-well fluids confined in narrow cylindrical hard pores. Fluid-solid phase transition and coexistence of square-well fluids confined in narrow cylindrical hard pores are characterized using molecular simulation methods. The equation of state containing a fluid phase, a solid phase and a fluid-solid coexistence state was separately obtained for different attractive ranges of potential well and pore diameters; lambda=1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 for a pore of diameter D=2.2sigma, lambda=1.5 and 1.65 for a pore of diameter D=2.5sigma. For lambda=1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 at pore diameter D=2.2sigma, lambda=1.5 at D=2.5sigma, the fluid-solid phase coexistence densities and pressure are close to the hard sphere fluids at the same temperature, while the pressure decreases significantly for lambda=1.5 at D=2.2sigma and lambda=1.65 at D=2.5sigma, respectively. We also report the structural properties of the systems undergoing a phase transition.	0
7704320	Gastrointestinal autonomic nerve tumours and their separation from other gastrointestinal stromal tumours: an ultrastructural and immunohistochemical study of seven cases. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) represent a heterogeneous group whose classification frequently requires ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies. In a retrospective study of the ultrastructural findings of 24 gastrointestinal stromal tumours, whose light microscopic study has yielded ambiguous results and in which accurate diagnosis had required ultrastructural support, seven were found to have the characteristics of gastrointestinal autonomic nerve (GAN) tumours. In all of them the diagnosis was based on the presence of dendritic processes with dense neuroendocrine granules. Immunohistochemically, the seven tumours were negative for smooth-muscle markers. All stained positively for vimentin. NSE, chromogranin, and synaptophysin were positive in most of them, while S-100 protein was positive only in two cases. We present the ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features of seven GANT against the background of the GISTs of our series. We conclude that GAN tumours cannot be diagnosed by light microscopy alone but this tumour group displays characteristic electron microscopic and immunohistochemical features and appears to represent a distinct type of GIST.	0
11580865	Assessing the heritability of attentional networks. BACKGROUND: Current efforts to study the genetics of higher functions have been lacking appropriate phenotypes to describe cognition. One of the problems is that many cognitive concepts for which there is a single word (e.g. attention) have been shown to be related to several anatomical networks. Recently we have developed an Attention Network Test (ANT) that provides a separate measure for each of three anatomically defined attention networks. In this small scale study, we ran 26 pairs of MZ and DZ twins in an effort to determine if any of these networks show sufficient evidence of heritability to warrant further exploration of their genetic basis. RESULTS: The efficiency of the executive attention network, that mediates stimulus and response conflict, shows sufficient heritability to warrant further study. Alerting and overall reaction time show some evidence for heritability and in our study the orienting network shows no evidence of heritability. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that genetic variation contributes to normal individual differences in higher order executive attention involving dopamine rich frontal areas including the anterior cingulate. At least the executive portion of the ANT may serve as a valid endophenotype for larger twin studies and subsequent molecular genetic analysis in normal subject populations.	0
22923612	Characterization of the DNA-binding properties of the Mohawk homeobox transcription factor. The homeobox transcription factor Mohawk (Mkx) is a potent transcriptional repressor expressed in the embryonic precursors of skeletal muscle, cartilage, and bone. MKX has recently been shown to be a critical regulator of musculoskeletal tissue differentiation and gene expression; however, the genetic pathways through which MKX functions and its DNA-binding properties are currently unknown. Using a modified bacterial one-hybrid site selection assay, we determined the core DNA-recognition motif of the mouse monomeric Mkx homeodomain to be A-C-A. Using cell-based assays, we have identified a minimal Mkx-responsive element (MRE) located within the Mkx promoter, which is composed of a highly conserved inverted repeat of the core Mkx recognition motif. Using the minimal MRE sequence, we have further identified conserved MREs within the locus of Sox6, a transcription factor that represses slow fiber gene expression during skeletal muscle differentiation. Real-time PCR and immunostaining of in vitro differentiated muscle satellite cells isolated from Mkx-null mice revealed an increase in the expression of Sox6 and down-regulation of slow fiber structural genes. Together, these data identify the unique DNA-recognition properties of MKX and reveal a novel role for Mkx in promoting slow fiber type specification during skeletal muscle differentiation.	1
11105309	[Rubral tremor of Holmes, rare case of pathological tremor: case report]. The authors present a very rare case of Holmes tremor (previously known as rubral or midbrain tremor). In all described till now cases the tremor was due to a known and revealed in laboratory or neuroimaging cause. We present an unusual case of a 42-year old woman with unilateral tremor of right extremities (mostly proximal part of upper extremity) which started abruptly 3 years ago. She had no suffer any serious disease before the onset of symptoms and her family history was also negative. The tremor was present at rest but accelerated during specific postures and active movements. The laboratory tests including: copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations, blood analysis for acanthocytes, evoked potentials, EEG, CT, MRI, MRA and SPECT did not reveal any significant changes. Treatment attempts with neuroleptics, clonazepam, L-dopa, valproic acid, biperiden were almost completely ineffective except local injections of botulinum toxin (Botox, Allergan, 150 U) into the muscles of right arm girdle which moderately alleviated tremor. We did not find any underlying pathology as a cause of tremor, clinically the same as symptomatic cases described in literature. We suggest the possibility of idiopathic origin of tremor in our case, although a very small size of lesion (f.i. ischaemic) could be undetectable in the described tests.	0
8897840	A critical evaluation of resting intracellular free calcium regulation in dystrophic mdx muscle. There are conflicting reports regarding whether resting free calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) are elevated in dystrophic mouse (mdx) myotubes and adult myofibers. We reinvestigated this question and found several lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that increased calcium influx via leak channels leads to increases in resting [Ca2+]i. 1) Step calibration of fura 2/free acid in myofibers with use of microinjected Ca(2+)-ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid buffers revealed greater [Ca2+]i in dystrophic cells. Careful calibration of fura PE3-AM, a compartmentalization-resistant derivative of fura 2, also showed elevated [Ca2+]i in mdx myotubes. 2) Chronic, but not acute, application of tetrodotoxin reduced resting [Ca2+]i in dystrophic myotubes, suggesting that elevated resting [Ca2+]i is a consequence of previous long-term contractile activity. 3) Rates of manganese quenching of fura 2 fluorescence, an indirect indicator of calcium influx, were significantly higher in mdx myotubes and were increased by nifedipine, a calcium leak channel agonist. 4) Calcium leak channel activity, measured using patch clamping, was greater in the sarcolemma of adult non-enzyme-treated mdx myofibers.	0
11515908	Herniation of the lung after video-assisted thoracic surgery. We report a case of lung herniation occurring following video-assisted thoracic surgery. Although lung hernias are rare, the widespread application of video-assisted thoracic surgery to patients at risk for lung hernia will likely result in more reports in the future. Consequently, pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons must be aware of this condition, risk factors for development, and potential methods of prevention in order to minimize the occurrence of this complication.	0
19296030	Neonatal resuscitation programme in Malaysia: an eight-year experience. INTRODUCTION: The neonatal resuscitation programme (NRP) published by the American Academy of Paediatrics and American Heart Association was launched in Malaysia in 1996. This study aimed to review the outcome of NRP in Malaysia during the first eight years. METHODS: Information on basic demographical data and training activities of NRP providers were collected prospectively from NRP instructors from all over Malaysia during the eight years following the inception of the NRP. The national perinatal and neonatal mortality data during the five-year period before and eight years following implementation of the NRP were compared. RESULTS: During the eight years following the launch, 14,575 personnel were trained. 40 percent of NRP-certified personnel worked in areas where delivery services were provided, viz. labour room, operation theatre, obstetric ward, emergency department and maternal and child health clinic. There were very few NRP-certified providers working in emergency departments and most of them were medical assistants. Most of the providers working in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and labour rooms were nurses while those in paediatric wards were doctors. All NRP-certified doctors working in NICUs and labour rooms obtained full certificates. Only 80 percent of NRP-certified nurses in these two areas obtained full certificates. There was further serial decrease in perinatal mortality and neonatal mortality rates in Malaysia during the years following the launch of the NRP programme. CONCLUSION: The launch of the Malaysian NRP was associated with further improvement in perinatal and neonatal mortality rates.	0

23418092	High-intensity training induces EIB in rats through neuron transdifferentiation of adrenal medulla chromaffin cells. A high prevalence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) can be found in elite athletes, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Airway responsiveness, NGF and epinephrine (EPI) levels, and chromaffin cell structure in high- (HiTr) and moderate-intensity training (MoTr) rats with or without ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization were measured in a total of 120 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The expression of NGF-associated genes in rat adrenal medulla was tested. Both HiTr and OVA intervention significantly increased airway resistance to aerosolized methacholine measured by whole body plethysmography. HiTr significantly increased inflammatory reaction in the lung with a major increase in peribronchial lymphocyte infiltration, whereas OVA significantly increased the infiltration of various inflammatory cells with an over 10-fold increase in eosinophil level in bronchoalveolar lavage. Both HiTr and OVA intervention upregulated circulating NGF level and peripherin level in adrenal medulla, but downregulated phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase level in adrenal medulla and circulating EPI level. HiTr + OVA and HiTr + ExhEx (exhaustive exercise) interventions significantly enhanced most of the HiTr effects. The elevated NGF level was significantly associated with neuronal conversion of adrenal medulla chromaffin cells (AMCC). The levels of p-Erk1/2, JMJD3, and Mash1 were significantly increased, but the levels of p-p38 and p-JNK were significantly decreased in adrenal medulla in HiTr and OVA rats. Injection of NGF antiserum and moderate-intensity training reversed these changes observed in HiTr and/or OVA rats. Our study suggests that NGF may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of EIB by inducing neuron transdifferentiation of AMCC via MAPK pathways and subsequently decreasing circulating EPI.	0
16380550	Deficiency of the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter gene leads to cardiac fibrosis and valvulopathy in mice. BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) overproduction is responsible for cardiac valvular disease in patients with carcinoid tumors. Reduced 5-HT inactivation is one proposed mechanism of the valvulopathy observed in individuals treated with the appetite suppressants fenfluramine and phentermine. One key protein limiting systemic availability of 5-HT is the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) expressed by platelets and pulmonary vascular cells; 5-HTT is responsible for 5-HT uptake and subsequent inactivation of the amine passing through the lung. Here we investigated whether 5-HTT-deficient (5-HTT-KO) mice developed structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and valvulopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac endothelial cells expressed large amounts of 5-HTT in wild-type mice. 5-HTT deficiency appeared to be associated with marked interstitial, perivascular, and valvular fibrosis as evidenced by staining of cardiac collagen in 5-HTT-KO mice. Histological analysis provided evidence for valvulopathy characterized by valvular hyperplasia and prominent fibrosis at the attachment site and base of the leaflets. Echocardiography revealed an increase in left ventricular lumen diameter and a decrease in left ventricular diameter fractional shortening. Although 5-HT1B receptors mediated the 5-HT-induced collagen secretion by human cardiac myofibroblasts, the contribution of this receptor type to valvulopathy was ruled out because double-KO mice deficient in both 5-HTT and 5-HT1B receptors showed the same cardiac alterations as 5-HTT-KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: The present results establish a link between 5-HTT and the development of cardiac fibrosis and valvulopathy in vivo. 5-HTT-KO mice represent an especially relevant model for studying the mechanisms by which 5-HT induces valvulopathy.	0
18597210	[Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors]. Two thirds of all neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are located in the gastroentero-pancreatic system. Depending on its localisation, each tumor presents a different histological pattern as well as different clinical symptoms and prognosis. Symptoms are usually due to the mass effects of the local tumor or tumor-related fibrosis. The classical \"carcinoid-syndrome\" with flush and diarrhea is seen in fewer than 10 %. Tests like chromogranin A (serum) or 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (24h urine-collection) are indicators for the initial diagnosis of NET. Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy is the most valuable imaging modality. In addition CT/MRI can be used for further topographical definition. Endoscopic techniques like the use of capsule endoscopy are being evaluated for the diagnosis of small intestinal NETs. The only curative treatment of NET is still complete surgical resection. However, it can only be done in 20 %, depending on localization and local extension of the primary tumor. If the liver is involved local ablation techniques should be considered. The gold standard for medical treatment is the use of somatostatin analogs, although interferons show a comparable therapeutic potential. Traditional cytotoxic agents should only be used for poorly differentiated tumors refractory to other forms of treatment. New compounds that target different pathways at the intra- and intercellular level are under investigation. Supportive therapy should be considered for the control of symptoms.	0
10123355	Five original recipes for strengthening hospital patient care. Organizational innovation has a varied parentage--its famous mother being necessity--that can include the economic climate, marketplace characteristics, an organization's unique history and culture, leadership style, and corporate species. The following five Robert Wood Johnson Foundation/Pew Charitable Trusts grantees (see article, page 1) cast their own perspectives on approaches to strengthening nursing. The first three chose different emphases on programs built on existing practice models. The fourth hospital focuses on preparing the groundwork for major change, while the last looks outside at educating the youth who will eventually fill its caregiver roles.	0
15620192	[Effects of qianggu electuary on ovariectomized osteoporotic rats]. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of qianggu electuary (QGE), a Chinese herbal preparation, on ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic rats. METHOD: Female Wistar rats were ovariectomized and administered QGE, calcium gluconate (CG) and longmu zhuanggu granules (LMZG) for 12 weeks. Bone mineral density (BMD), indexes of biomechanics and serum E2, Ca were detected in grouped rats including QGE, CG, LMZG and control groups. RESULT: QGE could significantly increase the BMD and maximum load, maximum stress YP-load of femora in the osteoporotic rats. The values of E2 in ovariectomized osteoporotic rats decreased, compared with those of control normal rats (P > 0.05), while in the QGE treated rats, the values of E2 increased. CONCLUSION: QGE can increase the BMD and improve indexes of bone biomechanics in ovariectomized osteopotic rats, possibly due to its estrogen-like effect.	0
8786124	The gene (POLR2L) encoding the hRPB7.6 subunit of human RNA polymerase. The gene (POLR2L) encoding a 7.6-kDa subunit (hRPB7.6) of human RNA polymerase has been cloned. It compromises two exons, 116 and 227 bp, respectively, interspaced with an intron of about 2.1 kb. This gene, whose localization has been assigned to the short arm of chromosome 11 (position 11p15), is transcribed in HeLa cells as one major messenger RNA, which encodes a 67-residue polypeptide (7645 Da) that shares strong homologies with the corresponding subunits of other eukaryotic and archaeal RNA polymerase subunits. Like its yeast counterpart (ABC10 beta, encoded by the RPB10 gene), the hRPB7.6 subunit may be shared by all three classes of human nuclear RNA polymerase. Cysteine residues characteristic of an atypical zinc-binding domain are conserved in the homologous sequences of all six species analyzed. A small, related RNA polymerase subunit from vaccinia virus exhibits an identical set of cysteines, suggesting that these residues may be contribute to a crucial function in the multimeric RNA polymerases.	0

22698020	Socioeconomic inequalities in health in older adults in Brazil and England. OBJECTIVES: We examined socioeconomic inequalities in health among older adults in England and Brazil. METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative samples of residents aged 50 years and older in 2008 data from the Brazilian National Household Survey (n   =   75,527) and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n   =   9589). We estimated prevalence ratios for self-rated health, functional limitations, and reported chronic diseases, by education level and household income tertiles. RESULTS: Brazilians reported worse health than did English respondents. Country-specific differences were higher among the poorest, but also affected the wealthiest persons. We observed a strong inverse gradient of similar magnitude across education and household income levels for most health indicators in each country. Prevalence ratios (lowest vs highest education level) of poor self-rated health were 3.24 in Brazil and 3.50 in England; having 2 or more functional limitations, 1.81 in Brazil and 1.96 in England; and having 1 or more diseases, 1.14 in Brazil and 1.36 in England. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic inequalities in health affect both populations, despite a less pronounced absolute difference in household income and education in Brazil than in England.	0
21262910	Validation of a small set of ancestral informative markers for control of population admixture in African Americans. Confounding due to population stratification is a potential source of concern in population-based genetic association studies, particularly in recently admixed populations such as African Americans. Several methods have been developed to control for population stratification in the context of genome-wide association studies. Because these approaches require thousands of genotypes from genetic markers, they are not well suited to be used in genetic association analyses without genome-wide data. An alternative approach to control for population stratification is to estimate admixture proportions by using ancestral informative markers (AIMs). The authors evaluated whether a relatively small number of AIMs would be sufficient to estimate ancestral proportions in African Americans. They first estimated European admixture proportions in 1,757 subjects from the Black Women's Health Study (1995-2009) by genotyping an admixture panel of 1,373 AIMs; they then compared these results with those obtained using smaller sets of AIMs. The authors found that just 30 AIMs are needed to obtain very high correlation of estimates with the entire set (r = 0.89; P < 0.0001). A set of 200 AIMs gave an almost perfect correlation with the entire set (r = 0.98; P < 0.0001). These results show that a small number of AIMs are sufficiently precise to estimate European admixture in African Americans.	0

20851035	Root hair systems biology. Plant functional genomic studies have largely measured the response of whole plants, organs and tissues, resulting in the dilution of the signal from individual cells. Methods are needed where the full repertoire of functional genomic tools can be applied to a single plant cell. Root hair cells are an attractive model to study the biology of a single, differentiated cell type because of their ease of isolation, polar growth, and role in water and nutrient uptake, as well as being the site of infection by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This review highlights the recent advances in our understanding of plant root hair biology and examines whether the root hair has potential as a model for plant cell systems biology.	0

We show, with examples, how our method of analysis of R (0) can be used in the design of strategies for controlling invasive species.	0

23644914	Cortical excitability in smoking and not smoking individuals with and without nicotine. RATIONAL: Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has a major neuromodulatory impact on central nervous system function. Beyond acute activation, chronic nicotine intake has long-lasting effects on cortical excitability in animal experiments, caused by receptor up- or down-regulation. Knowledge about the impact of nicotine on cortical excitability in humans, however, is limited. OBJECTIVES: We therefore aimed to explore the effect of nicotine intake on cortical excitability in healthy human smokers and non-smokers. METHODS: The primary motor cortex served as model, and cortical excitability was monitored via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Corticospinal excitability and intracortical excitability were recorded before and after application of nicotine patch in both groups. Corticospinal excitability was explored by motor threshold and input/output curve (I/O curve), and intracortical excitability was explored by means of paired-pulse TMS techniques (intracortical facilitation (ICF), short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI), I-wave facilitation and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI)). RESULTS: The results show that smokers during nicotine withdrawal display increased corticospinal excitability with regard to the I/O curve (TMS intensity 150  % of resting motor threshold) compared to non-smokers and furthermore enhanced SAI and diminished ICF at the intracortical circuit level. After administration of nicotine, intracortical facilitation in smokers increased, while in non-smokers, inhibition (SICI, SAI) was enhanced. CONCLUSION: Our results show that chronic nicotine consumption in smokers alters cortical excitability independent from acute nicotine consumption and that acute nicotine has different effects on motor cortical excitability in both groups.	0

23355086	Adverse postoperative outcomes in surgical patients with immune thrombocytopenia. BACKGROUND: Patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are likely to have various medical co-morbidities, yet their global features regarding adverse postoperative outcomes and use of medical resources when undergoing major surgery are unknown. The objective of this study was to validate whether ITP is an independent risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes, and to explore the potential clinical predictors of outcomes after major surgery among patients with ITP. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, controlling for preoperative co-morbidities by means of multiple logistic regression. Major postoperative complication and mortality rates, and in-hospital medical costs were analysed. RESULTS: The study included 11,085 surgical patients with ITP and 44,340 controls without ITP matched for sex, age, and type of surgery and anaesthesia. Surgical patients with ITP had a higher risk of postoperative death (odds ratio (OR) 1.89, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.57 to 2.27), and overall postoperative complications (OR 1.47, 1.39 to 1.56), and increased hospital stay (OR 1.90, 1.80 to 2.01), admission to the intensive care unit (OR 1.73, 1.63 to 1.83) and medical costs (OR 1.89, 1.79 to 1.99). Amount of preoperative platelet and/or red blood cell transfusion, emergency visits and admission to hospital for ITP care were identified as risk factors for adverse postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patients with ITP undergoing surgery are at increased risk of adverse perioperative events, particularly if blood or blood product transfusion are required preoperatively, or the procedure is done as an emergency.	0
24120162	Recent advances in the development of single cell analysis--a review. Development of techniques for the analysis of the content of individual cells represents an important direction in modern bioanalytical chemistry. While the analysis of chromosomes, organelles, or location of selected proteins has been traditionally the domain of microscopic techniques, the advances in miniaturized analytical systems bring new possibilities for separations and detections of molecules inside the individual cells including smaller molecules such as hormones or metabolites. It should be stressed that the field of single cell analysis is very broad, covering advanced optical, electrochemical and mass spectrometry instrumentation, sensor technology and separation techniques. The number of papers published on single cell analysis has reached several hundred in recent years. Thus a complete literature coverage is beyond the limits of a journal article. The following text provides a critical overview of some of the latest developments with the main focus on mass spectrometry, microseparation methods, electrophoresis in capillaries and microfluidic devices and respective detection techniques for performing single cell analyses.	0
17297480	Beyond standardization: dynamic software infrastructures for systems biology. Progress in systems biology is seriously hindered by slow production of suitable software infrastructures. Biologists need infrastructure that easily connects to work that is done in other laboratories, for which standardization is helpful. However, the infrastructure must also accommodate the specifics of their biological system, but appropriate mechanisms to support variation are currently lacking. We argue that a minimal computer language, and a software tool called a generator, can be used to quickly produce customized software infrastructures that 'systems biologists really want to have'.	0

17184068	[Hemodynamic disorders in liver transplantation and their correction]. To study the pre- and intraoperative causes of hemodynamic disorders at the basic stages of liver transplantation in adult recipients, case histories and anesthesia protocols were analyzed in detail in 15 recipients of the cadaveric liver (Group 1) and 60 recipients of a liver portion taken from a living relative donor (Group 2). The patients' preoperative status, the etiology of the disease, the pattern and scope of preoperative preparation and examination, the cause of anesthesia, the volume, pattern, and rate of infusion were studied. Particular emphasis was placed on the presence of pathophysiological prerequisites and various intraoperative factors, which are causes of hemodynamic disorders. Orthotopic transplantation of the liver was performed under generalized balanced anesthesia whose major components were the inhalational anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane (89.3%) or total intravenous anesthesia based on neuroleptic anesthetics (10.7%). The main causes of hemodynamic disorders were the patients' severe baseline condition, anemia, ascitis, intoxication, encephalopathy, and the specific features of a surgical intervention, blood loss, heavy plasma and perspiration losses, water-electrolyte balance impairments, vein-vein shunt and reperfusion syndrome. Operations of extraordinary duration (longer than 15-20 hours) required higher plasma compensation volumes (36-52 ml/kg). Severest hemodynamic disorders were observed in patients admitted to hospital for emergency transplantation of the cadaveric liver. These patients who are to undergo transplantation are outside hospital in most cases, which is why any operation should be regarded in them as an emergency one made in patients who are in a very severe state (ASA IV-VE).	0

19387489	Comparative profiling identifies C13orf3 as a component of the Ska complex required for mammalian cell division. Proliferation of mammalian cells requires the coordinated function of many proteins to accurately divide a cell into two daughter cells. Several RNAi screens have identified previously uncharacterised genes that are implicated in mammalian cell division. The molecular function for these genes needs to be investigated to place them into pathways. Phenotypic profiling is a useful method to assign putative functions to uncharacterised genes. Here, we show that the analysis of protein localisation is useful to refine a phenotypic profile. We show the utility of this approach by defining a function of the previously uncharacterised gene C13orf3 during cell division. C13orf3 localises to centrosomes, the mitotic spindle, kinetochores, spindle midzone, and the cleavage furrow during cell division and is specifically phosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, C13orf3 is required for centrosome integrity and anaphase onset. Depletion by RNAi leads to mitotic arrest in metaphase with an activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and loss of sister chromatid cohesion. Proteomic analyses identify C13orf3 (Ska3) as a new component of the Ska complex and show a direct interaction with a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase PP2A. All together, these data identify C13orf3 as an important factor for metaphase to anaphase progression and highlight the potential of combined RNAi screening and protein localisation analyses.	0
23904140	A simple test for synergy for a small number of combinations. A method for detecting deviations from the Loewe additive drug combination reference model for in vitro drug combination experimentation is described. It is often difficult to fit a response surface model to drug combination data, especially in situations where the experimental design contains a sparse set of combinations. The literature does contain good response surface modeling approaches, but they tend to be complex and can be difficult to execute. It is especially difficult to check model quality when fitting to more than two combined agents. A simple method based on sound statistical principles is proposed that examines the mean response deviation of each combination from the predicted response under Loewe additivity. The method can readily handle any number of combined agents, does not require sophisticated modeling, and can even be programmed into Microsoft Excel without the use of macros. Several potential extensions to the method are discussed in detail. Computer-generated simulations demonstrate the statistical capabilities of the approach, and a real-data example is given to illustrate the method.	0

23231351	Porphyrin metabolisms in human skin commensal Propionibacterium acnes bacteria: potential application to monitor human radiation risk. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, is a commensal organism in human skin. Like human cells, the bacteria produce porphyrins, which exhibit fluorescence properties and make bacteria visible with a Wood's lamp. In this review, we compare the porphyrin biosynthesis in humans and P. acnes. Also, since P. acnes living on the surface of skin receive the same radiation exposure as humans, we envision that the changes in porphyrin profiles (the absorption spectra and/or metabolism) of P. acnes by radiation may mirror the response of human cells to radiation. The porphyrin profiles of P. acnes may be a more accurate reflection of radiation risk to the patient than other biodosimeters/biomarkers such as gene up-/down-regulation, which may be non-specific due to patient related factors such as autoimmune diseases. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and possible solutions for using the P. acnes response to predict the radiation risk.	0

11556706	Replication competition between lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus quasispecies in mice. Implications for quasispecies selection and evolution. The common quasispecies of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), LDV-P and LDV-vx, are highly resistant to the humoral host immune response because the single neutralization epitope on the ectodomain of the primary envelope glycoprotein, VP-3P, carries three large N-glycans. Two laboratory mutants, LDV-C and LDV-v, have lost two of the N-glycans on the VP-3P ectodomain, thereby gaining neuropathogenicity for AKR/C58 mice but at the same time, becoming susceptible to the humoral immune response of the host. In attempts to further assess the origins and evolution of these LDVs we have determined their competitiveness by monitoring their fate in mixed infections of wild type, SCID, nude, and cyclophosphamide-treated mice by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction assays that distinguish between them. In mixed infections with LDV-P and LDV-vx, LDV-C and LDV-v became rapidly lost even when present initially in large excess over the former. In mixed infections of mice unable to generate neutralizing antibodies, LDV-C and LDV-v also became replaced by LDV-P and LDV-vx as predominant quasispecies but more slowly than in immunocompetent mice. The results indicate that the humoral immune response plays an important role in the displacement of LDV-C and LDV-v by LDV-P and LDV-vx but that in addition, LDV-C and LDV-v possess an impaired ability to compete with LDV-P and LDV-vx in the productive infection of the subpopulation of macrophages that represents the host for all these LDVs. In addition, LDV-v outcompeted LDV-C in mixed infections and the same was the case for neutralization escape mutants of LDV-v and LDV-C which had regained all three N-glycosylation sites on the VP-3P ectodomain. Thus a hierarchy exists in replication fitness: LDV-P/LDV-vx>LDV-v>LDV-C, which is unrelated to the number of N-glycans on the VP-3P ectodomain. The implications of the results in relation to the evolution and selection of the LDV-quasispecies is discussed. LDV-P and LDV-vx are genetically highly stable and thus seem to have achieved evolutionary stasis with optimum ability to establish viremic persistent infections of mice that are unimpeded by the host immune responses.	0

After having excluded any traumatic and cerebral origins, an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was performed and revealed a\"dissociation albuminocytologique\". This finding in association with limb quadriplegia led to the diagnosis of Guillain-Barr   syndrome. Therapy with high-dose i.v. immunoglobulins led to a complete recovery.	0
9527903	Selective loss of alpha motoneurons innervating the medial gastrocnemius muscle in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase gene 1 (SOD-1) are found in patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS). Overexpression of a mutated human SOD-1 gene in mice results in neurodegenerative disease as result of motoneuron loss in lumbar spinal cord (10). Using this mouse model of FALS, we have established a quantitative assay utilizing the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) to determine the number of motoneurons innervating one skeletal muscle in mice with ongoing disease. In adult wild-type mice, the number of alpha motoneurons retrogradely labeled by an injection of FG into medial gastrocnemius muscle is 50 +/- 7 and this number remains constant from 7 to 18 weeks of age. In mutant mice, the number of alpha motoneurons retrogradely labeled by FG is the same as in wild-type mice at 7 and 9 weeks, but then declines to 36% of that in normal mice at 18 weeks. This decline also correlates positively to severity of motor impairments in these mice as assessed by the hindlimb splay test. In contrast, the number of FG-labeled gamma motoneurons remains relatively unchanged in both wild-type and mutant mice up to 18 weeks. At 18 weeks of age, this apparent alpha motoneuron denervation is paralleled by an average of 55% reduction of MG-muscle mass and 40% weaker performance in the hindlimb splay test. These data suggest that alpha motoneurons are the most vulnerable neuronal subtype in this mouse model of ALS and it is primarily their loss that leads to functional motor deficits. This quantitative bioassay also will be valuable for evaluating novel therapeutics for ALS.	0
11254275	Calculation of the BET-Compatible Surface Area from Any Type I Isotherms Measured above the Critical Temperature. In our previous papers [T  th, J., et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci. 212, 402 (1999); 212, 411 (1999)] it has been proven that a BET-compatible specific surface area, a(s)(c)(N(2), 77), can be calculated from any Type I monolayer isotherms and from the monolayer domain of Type II isotherms, both measured below the critical temperature. In this paper, the calculation of a(s)(c)(N(2), 77) from Type I isotherms at temperatures above the critical temperature is discussed. These calculations are also based on the thermodynamical consistent form of the T  th (T) equation. This relationship can be derived from the differential equation dn(s)/n(s)=[psi(p)](-1)dp/p, where the function psi(p) is calculable from the measured isotherms and includes the change in the surface free energy. The basic problem of the calculation of a(s)(c)(N(2), 77) is the determination of the upper limit of integration (p(u)) required to solve this differential equation. It is demonstrated that p(u) can be calculated from the equation ln(p(u))=-alphaT(-1)+beta. The constants alpha and beta are independent of the temperature of the isotherms but they are very sensitive to the structure of adsorbents and to the quality of adsorptives. This fact also makes it possible to characterize exactly the nanostructure of solids and the state of adsorptives. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.	0

However, electric fields could have a lower threshold in conditions where field sensitivity is enhanced, such as those simulating epilepsy. Uniform electrical fields were applied to hippocampal brain slices exposed to picrotoxin, high potassium or low calcium solutions. The results in the low calcium medium show that neuronal activity can be completely blocked in 10% of the 30 slices tested with a field amplitude of 1 mV mm(-1). These results suggest that the threshold for this effect is clearly smaller than 1 mV mm(-1). The hypothesis that the extracellular resistance could affect the sensitivity to the electrical fields was tested by measuring the effect of the osmolarity of the extracellular solution on the efficacy of the field. A 10% decrease in osmolarity resulted in a 56% decrease (n = 4) in the minimum field required for full suppression. A 14% in osmolarity produced an 81% increase in the minimum field required for full suppression. These results show that the extracellular volume can modulate the efficacy of the field and could lower the threshold field amplitudes to values lower than approximately 1 mmV mm(-1).	0
20943513	Two new unusual Leucoagaricus species (Agaricaceae) from tropical China with blue-green staining reactions. Most species of the genus Leucoagaricus have been described from temperate regions in North America and Europe, but little is known about the genus from tropical areas. In this report we describe two new species of Leucoagaricus, namely La. flavovirens and La. atroazureus, from tropical China. The two species are characterized by turning blue-green or dark blue where bruised and by unique phylogenetic placement. Two new combinations, namely La. viriditinctus and La. caerulescens, are proposed. A collection examined and cited under the name of La. viridiflavus by Kumar _ Manimohan (2009b), who designated the neotype of the species, (Petch) TKA Kumar _ Manimohan, was found to differ from La. flavovirens based on morphology and ITS sequence comparison.

22731884	Simple rules describe bottom-up and top-down control in food webs with alternative energy pathways. Many human influences on the world's ecosystems have their largest direct impacts at either the top or the bottom of the food web. To predict their ecosystem-wide consequences we must understand how these impacts propagate. A long-standing, but so far elusive, problem in this endeavour is how to reduce food web complexity to a mathematically tractable, but empirically relevant system. Simplification to main energy channels linking primary producers to top consumers has been recently advocated. Following this approach, we propose a general framework for the analysis of bottom-up and top-down forcing of ecosystems by reducing food webs to two energy pathways originating from a limiting resource shared by competing guilds of primary producers (e.g. edible vs. defended plants). Exploring dynamical models of such webs we find that their equilibrium responses to nutrient enrichment and top consumer harvesting are determined by only two easily measurable topological properties: the lengths of the component food chains (odd-odd, odd-even, or even-even) and presence vs. absence of a generalist top consumer reconnecting the two pathways (yielding looped vs. branched webs). Many results generalise to other looped or branched web structures and the model can be easily adapted to include a detrital pathway.	0

11065257	Churg-Strauss syndrome associated with pregnancy. Churg-Strauss syndrome, an uncommon condition, occurs even more rarely in association with pregnancy. One month postpartum, a 25-year-old Japanese woman was hospitalized for dyspnea, fever, diarrhea, and complaints of dysesthesia in the right lower limb and right lumbar and abdominal region. Marked eosinophilia was present. Symptoms of bronchial asthma had developed early in the pregnancy, which concluded with delivery of a healthy baby at 39 weeks of gestation. Churg-Strauss syndrome was diagnosed and prednisolone was administered with a good response leading to remission. Three years after the first pregnancy, low-dose steroid therapy was continued through another pregnancy. The patient delivered another healthy baby at 39 weeks of gestation, this time with no exacerbation of symptoms.	0
24287579	The last intron of the human thrombopoietin gene enhances expression in milk of transgenic mice. Introns can enhance gene expression levels. This effect is known as intron-mediated enhancement, which is different from that of enhancers or promoters. In our previous study, under the control of the cytomegalovirus or goat b-casein promoter, the vector containing intron V-TPOcDNA expressed the highest thrombopoietin (TPO) level, whereas the vector containing TPOgDNA expressed the lowest level. In order to verify whether intron V also improves TPO expression in the milk of transgenic mice, rat whey acidic protein promoter was used as regulatory element to construct mammary gland expression vectors including pTPOWA (containing TPOcDNA), pTPOWB (containing intron V-TPOcDNA), and pTPOWC (containing TPOgDNA). These vectors were transfected into HC-11 cells and the supernatants were analyzed at 48 h. The highest TPO level was found in pTPOWB (795 pg/mL) and the lowest level in pTPOWC (193 pg/mL). Then, corresponding vectors were microinjected into fertilized mice zygotes. Transgenic mice were identified by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to measure TPO levels in the milk of lactating transgenic mice. The highest and lowest TPO levels were found in transgenic mice carrying intron V-TPOcDNA (2,307 pg/mL) and in transgenic mice carrying TPOgDNA (242 pg/mL), respectively. Thus, intron V remarkably improved TPO expression in transgenic mice.	0
19900540	Mutations alter secretion of fukutin-related protein. Mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I) as well as other severe muscle disorders, including Walker-Warburg syndrome, muscle-eye-brain disease, and congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C. The FKRP gene encodes a putative glycosyltransferase, but its precise localization and functions have yet to be determined. In the present study, we demonstrated that normal FKRP is secreted into culture medium and mutations alter the pattern of secretion in CHO cells. L276I mutation associated with mild disease phenotype was shown to reduce the level of secretion whereas P448L and C318Y mutations associated with severe disease phenotype almost abolished the secretion. However, a truncated FKRP mutant protein lacking the entire C-terminal 185 amino acids due to the E310X nonsense mutation was able to secrete as efficiently as the normal FKRP. The N-terminal signal peptide sequence is apparently cleaved from the secreted FKRP proteins. Alteration of the secretion pathway by different mutations and spontaneous read-through of nonsense mutation may contribute to wide variations in phenotypes associated with FKRP-related diseases.	0
16687219	A one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR for detection and typing of bovine viral diarrhea viruses. A one-step multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using SmartCycler technology and TaqMan probes was developed for detection and typing of bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV). Common primers and type-specific (BVDV1 and BVDV2) TaqMan probes were designed in the 5'-untranslated region of the viral genome. The real-time assay was able to detect 10-100 TCID50 of virus, with correlation coefficient (r2) values of 0.998 and 0.999 for BVDV1 and BVDV2, respectively. The assay accurately typed 54 BVDV strains and field isolates and specificity of the TaqMan probes was further demonstrated by the lack of reactivity with the closely related Pestiviruses, classical swine fever virus and border disease virus. The assay was also shown to have high reproducibility. When the assay was compared with virus isolation for bovine serum samples, there was full agreement between the tests. Thus, the one-step real-time RT-PCR assay appears to be a rapid, sensitive, and specific test for detection and typing of BVDV.	0

21529292	Monoclonal antibodies against Muscleblind-like 3, a protein with punctate nuclear localization. Muscleblind-like 3 (MBNL3) belongs to a family of RNA binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing. We have generated a set of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against mouse MBNL3, three of which do not cross-react with the other muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2. Epitope mapping revealed that MAbs P1C7, P1E7, SP1C2, and P2E6 recognize distinct, non-overlapping segments of the MBNL3 polypeptide sequence. Immunohistochemical staining of proliferating muscle precursor cells localized MBNL3 to the nucleus in a punctate pattern, characteristic of subcellular structures in the nucleus enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors. Although MBNL3 did not co-localize with SC35 and PSP1 (widely used markers of splicing speckles and paraspeckles), the punctate localization pattern of MBNL3 within interchromatin regions of the nucleus is highly predictive of proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing. Monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse MBNL3 will facilitate further investigation of the expression pattern and unique functions of this splicing factor during development and in different adult mouse tissues.	0

19588066	Lethality toxicities induced by metal exposure during development in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Lethality changes were investigated during development in 4 h metal exposed Caenorhabditis elegans. Exposure to examined metals caused severe lethality toxicities in L1- and L2-larvae, in L3-larvae exposed to examined metals at concentrations of 50 and 100 microM and to Pb, Hg, and Cr at the concentration of 2.5 microM, in L4-larvae exposed to examined metals at concentrations of 50 and 100 microM, and in adults exposed to Pb, Hg, and Cr at the concentration of 100 microM. Moreover, the lethality toxicities induced by Pb and Hg in L1 larvae for 4 h could be largely comparable to those in young adults for 24 h.	0
15692976	The relationship between body composition and knee cartilage volume in healthy, middle-aged subjects. OBJECTIVE: Although obesity is widely accepted as a risk factor for knee osteoarthritis, it is not clear whether individual components of body composition, such as the mass and distribution of muscle and fat, are associated with development of the disease. This study examined the effect of measures of body composition on the longitudinal change in tibial cartilage volume. METHODS: Body composition, assessed via dual x-ray absorptiometry, and tibial cartilage volume, assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, were measured in 86 healthy men and women who were mid-life in age. Change in tibial cartilage volume was assessed by imaging each knee 2 years after the baseline measurement and determining the difference from baseline in tibial cartilage volume. Correlations were determined between the muscle and fat mass of the arm, leg, and total body and the volume of the lateral- and medial-tibial cartilage, as well as the change in tibial cartilage volume over 2 years, after adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: There was a significant association between muscle mass and the medial-tibial cartilage volume, independent of age, sex, body mass index, tibial bone area, and level of physical activity. Although there was a positive association between muscle mass and the lateral-tibial cartilage volume, this did not persist after adjustment for confounders. Loss of muscle mass was associated with an increased loss of medial- and lateral-tibial cartilage over 2 years, after adjusting for confounders. No relationship was apparent between fat mass and either medial- or lateral-tibial cartilage volume, or between fat mass and change in either medial- or lateral-tibial cartilage volume over 2 years, after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION: Muscle mass is an independent predictor of medial-tibial cartilage volume in healthy people in mid-life and is associated with a reduction in the rate of loss of tibial cartilage. This suggests that increased muscle mass may be protective against the onset of osteoarthritis.	0
18262376	[Contribution of case-crossover design to the analysis of short-term health effects of air pollution: reanalysis of air pollution and health data]. BACKGROUND: During the last decades, numerous studies have shown significant links between short-term exposure to air pollution and health. Time series design have been widely used in order to study these associations. In recent years, the case-crossover design has been applied to the analysis of acute effects of environmental exposures, especially air pollution. The aims of this paper are to describe the case-crossover design and to compare this approach with time series design to assess the association between air pollution and health. METHODS: In the case-crossover approach, a case-control study is conducted whereby each person who had a health event (case period) is matched with himself/herself on a nearby time period where he/she did not have the event (control period). Review of the literature shows that the referent selection strategies can be associated to a bias in the estimation of the health effect of air pollution. In comparison with time series design, the case-crossover design is easier to conduct, and individual factors can be taken into account. Nevertheless, it is not possible to take into account the overdispersion in the health indicator with this approach. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we suggest to use time series analysis with population data and case-crossover design with individual data.	0
15911341	Differential actions of nerve growth factor receptors TrkA and p75NTR in a rat model of epileptogenesis. Kindling, an experimental model of epileptogenesis, and activation-induced synaptic reorganization are modulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), but whether NGF acts via its high-affinity receptor TrkA and/or the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR is unknown. We previously demonstrated, and confirmed in this study, that inhibition of NGF binding to both TrkA and p75NTR inhibited kindling and decreased kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting. We now report specific inhibition of TrkA.NGF binding, but not p75NTR.NGF binding, retarded perforant path kindling progression. However, mossy fiber sprouting was inhibited by either selective TrkA.NGF or p75NTR.NGF antagonists. Our results suggest that TrkA, but not p75NTR, plays a role in kindling, while both receptors modulate kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting. This implicates different mechanisms of neurotrophin action on kindling (mediated by TrkA) and neuronal sprouting (mediated by both TrkA and p75NTR) and suggests that sprouting involves kindling-independent neurotrophin action via p75NTR.	0

17826733	The effect of centrifugal force on the mRNA and protein levels of ATF4 in cultured human periodontal ligament fibroblasts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the changes of ATF4 expression in cultured human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLF) after mechanical stimuli, and to investigate whether ATF4 is essential for the mechanical stress-induced hPDLF differentiation. METHODS: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to examine mRNA and protein levels of ATF4 expression in hPDLFs after application of centrifugal force. pMyc-ATF4 transfected cells were subjected to centrifugal force for 30min, and the changes of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OCN), osteopontin (OPN), collagen I (COLI), bone sialoprotein (BSP) genes were measured to assess the differentiation of hPDLFs. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of ATF4 increased shortly and then decreased rapidly towards its pre-pressure levels. Overexpression of pMyc-ATF4 exhibited a greater increase in ALP activity and all four osteogenic genes compared to the untransfected cells in response to the centrifugal force. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ATF4 is essential in response of hPDLFs to mechanical stress, resulting in increased differentiation of hPDLFs to osteoblast-like cells.	0

10770027	Survey of infectious skin diseases and skin infestations among primary school students of Taitung County, eastern Taiwan. BACKGROUND: There are no complete records on the prevalence of childhood skin diseases in Taiwan. We conducted a survey of infectious skin diseases and skin infestations among primary school children in Taitung County, which is located in southeastern Taiwan. METHODS: From March 1998 through October 1998, a total of 3,029 students from four rural districts (Changbin, Yanping, Lanyu, and Dawu) and one urban area (Taitung City of Taitung County) were examined by dermatologists. Treatment and instructions for disease care were given immediately after the diagnosis of dermatoses, when appropriate. RESULTS: The most common infectious skin diseases and infestations were pediculosis capitis (12.9%), verruca vulgaris (5.1%), tinea versicolor (4.4%), tinea pedis (4.1%), verruca plantaris (1.8%), and scabies (1.4%). Most skin diseases, including pediculosis capitis, scabies, verruca vulgaris, verruca plantaris, folliculitis, pyoderma, tinea pedis, and tinea versicolor, were significantly more common in rural areas than in the urban area (p < 0.05 for all). Pediculosis capitis was more common among girls (p < 0.001), but tinea pedis and tinea versicolor were more common among boys (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of most skin infections and infestations are much higher in rural Taitung County than in Taitung City. Prevention and treatment of these skin diseases should be reemphasized in the education of teachers, as well as students and their families. Adequate dermatologic training of nurses and physicians and the development of teleconsultation and teledermatology in rural areas might decrease the prevalence of these skin diseases in school children.	0
11278455	Genomic structure of the promoters of the human estrogen receptor-alpha gene demonstrate changes in chromatin structure induced by AP2gamma. Expression of human estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) involves the activity from several promoters that give rise to alternate untranslated 5' exons. However, the genomic locations of the alternate 5' exons have not been reported previously. We have developed a contig map of the human ERalpha gene that includes all of the known alternate 5' exons. By using S1 nuclease and 5'- rapid amplification of cDNA ends, the cap sites for the alternate ERalpha transcripts E and H were identified. DNase I-hypersensitive sites specific to ERalpha-positive cells were associated with each of the cap sites. A DNase I-hypersensitive site, HS1, was localized to binding sites for AP2 in the untranslated region of exon 1 and was invariably present in the chromatin structure of ERalpha-positive cells. Overexpression of AP2gamma in human mammary epithelial cells generated the HS1-hypersensitive site. The ERalpha promoter was induced by AP2gamma in mammary epithelial cells, and trans-activation was dependent upon the region of the promoter containing the HS1 site. These results demonstrate that AP2gamma trans-activates the ERalpha gene in hormone-responsive tumors by inducing changes in the chromatin structure of the ERalpha promoter. These data are further evidence for a critical role for AP2 in the oncogenesis of hormone-responsive breast cancers.	1

22732991	Analysis of bone microarchitecture related to anthropometry in climateric women. BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is one of the most important public health problems involving a high percentage of costs in the medical care system. Reliable diagnostic techniques for an early detection of bone deterioration and studies of factors that influence its development in menopausal women are crucial. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between bone microarchitecture and anthropometry in climacteric women. METHODS: Women were recruited at the Menopause Clinic, University Hospital of FMRP/USP, and submitted to anthropometry and to the evaluation of bone quality (Ultrasound Bone Profile Index, UBPI) and quantity (Amplitudedependent Speed of Sound, AD-SoS-) by phalangeal quantitative osteosonography (DBM Sonic BP). Descriptive analysis of the data was reported and a multiple linear regression was performed using the software SAS   9.0. RESULTS: 71 patients aged 58    7 y were studied: 28% had BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2), 35% BMI 24.9-29.9 and 37% BMI > 30. Mean AD-SoS was 2059    79 m/s and mean UBPI was 0.67    0.13. Considering AD-SoS the dependent variable, there was no statistically significant relationship between age (p = 0.20), BMI (p = 0.76), fat mass by bioelectrical impedance (p = 0.42) and by anthropometry (p = 0.95). The variables had very low effect on the UBPI when it was considered the dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between bone microarchitecture and the anthropometry of the women studied shows that, the greater the bone quantity, the better the anthropometric parameters, without statistically significance. This work was a cross-sectional study on a small sample that needs to be validated in a prospective design.	0
6937444	Education in forensic odontology. The present state of education in forensic odontology is surveyed. Courses in the subject within dental schools are directed mainly towards dental students (lectures, seminars, demonstrations), but also towards chairside assistants, dental hygienists and laboratory technicians. Extra-mural postgraduate education is directed towards private practitioners, but includes community dental health officers and colleagues serving in the defence forces; the question of 'qualification' is discussed. Finally, a wide range of non-dental personnel is approached (medical and law students, community health officers, forensic medical experts, police technicians etc.). The authors concur that independent departments of forensic odontology are now needed at all major dental schools; only here can the manpower and the facilities be developed to cope with this wide spectrum of education, and only here can recognized academic positions be ensured for those who--together with other specialists--must handle an increasing extra-mural case load, from which all material for education and research is subsequently to be derived.	0
14754893	PE-1/METS, an antiproliferative Ets repressor factor, is induced by CREB-1/CREM-1 during macrophage differentiation. The molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the balance between cellular proliferation and differentiation remain poorly understood. Members of the Ets-domain family of transcription factors are candidates for proteins that might differentially regulate cell cycle control and cell type-specific genes during the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. The Ets repressor PE-1/METS has been suggested to contribute to growth arrest during terminal macrophage differentiation by repressing Ets target genes involved in Ras-dependent proliferation. An important feature of this regulatory model is that PE-1/METS is itself induced by the program of macrophage differentiation elicited by M-CSF. Here, we present evidence that the PE-1/METS gene is a transcriptional target of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein-1 (CREB-1). CREB-1 expression is dramatically up-regulated during macrophage differentiation and phosphorylation of CREB-1 and the related factor CREM-1 are stimulated by M-CSF in a SAPK2/p38-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that CREB-1/CREM-1 are recruited to the PE-1/METS promoter as well as to the promoters of other genes that are up-regulated during terminal macrophage differentiation. Overexpression of CREB-1 stimulates the activities of the PE-1/METS, and macrosialin promoters, while expression of a dominant negative form of CREB-1 during macrophage differentiation inhibits expression of the PE-1/METS and macrosialin genes. Inhibition of CREB function also results in reduced expression of CD54 and impaired cell adhesion. Taken together, these findings reveal new roles of CREB-1/CREM-1 as regulators of macrophage differentiation.	1
22102160	Online enzymatic sequencing of glycans from Trastuzumab by phospholipid-assisted capillary electrophoresis. CE separations of glycans taken from the cancer drug, Trastuzumab (Herceptin(  )), were accomplished using phospholipid additives. Glycans were labeled with 1-aminopyrene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid and were separated with efficiencies as high as 510000 theoretical plates in a 60.2 cm 25  m id fused-silica capillary. The thermally tunable phospholipid was loaded into the capillary when it possessed a viscosity similar to that of water. The temperature was increased, and the separations were performed when the material exhibited higher viscosity. Enzymes were integrated into the separation with the phospholipid additive. Neuraminidase, b1-4 galactosidase, and b-N-acetylglucosaminidase were injected into the capillary without covalent modification and used for enzyme hydrolysis. Exoglycosidase enzymes cleaved the terminal glycan residues. The glycan sequence could be verified based on enzyme specificity. Neuraminidase was used to determine total glycan content of the low-abundance glycans containing sialic acid. b1-4 Galactosidase and b-N-acetylglucosaminidase were used sequentially in-capillary, to determine the structure of the high-abundance glycans.	0

16779798	Separate brain regions code for salience vs. valence during reward prediction in humans. Predicting rewards and avoiding aversive conditions is essential for survival. Recent studies using computational models of reward prediction implicate the ventral striatum in appetitive rewards. Whether the same system mediates an organism's response to aversive conditions is unclear. We examined the question using fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent measurements while healthy volunteers were conditioned using appetitive and aversive stimuli. The temporal difference learning algorithm was used to estimate reward prediction error. Activations in the ventral striatum were robustly correlated with prediction error, regardless of the valence of the stimuli, suggesting that the ventral striatum processes salience prediction error. In contrast, the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insula coded for the differential valence of appetitive/aversive stimuli. Given its location at the interface of limbic and motor regions, the ventral striatum may be critical in learning about motivationally salient stimuli, regardless of valence, and using that information to bias selection of actions.	0

The dramatic episode of a febrile seizure, happening short and generalized with normal children, has a good prognosis. The examiner has to perform a very exact differential diagnosis in which an exact history and physical examination have to be on the first place, followed by serological examinations, the EEG and occasionally a lumbar punction. Skull radiography, as we wanted to show in the paper, has lost its place in general examination and should be reserved for special cases.	0
9268677	High-level expression of soluble protein in Escherichia coli using a His6-tag and maltose-binding-protein double-affinity fusion system. Using the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vector pMAL-c1 from C. V. Maina et al. (1988, Gene 74, 365-373), we have constructed expression vectors which contain a sequence encoding six consecutive histidine residues (His6-tag) at the 3' end of the MBP-encoding malE gene which is followed by either a thrombin-binding site (LVPRGS) or a factor Xa-binding site (IEGR). The benefits of this approach include; (a) high expression levels of soluble MBP fusion proteins (exceeding 2% of the total cellular protein), (b) high-quality purification of proteins under various conditions (high salt, low salt, denaturing, nondenaturing, etc.), and (c) two alternative protease cleavage sites to test for the most efficient cleavage of each fusion protein. We also constructed these MBP-His 6-tag expression vectors with alternative selection markers (Ampr, Kanr) and alternative promoters (tac, T7). Using these constructs, we expressed and purified several proteins of which we present two, penicillin-binding protein PBP2a and UDP-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase (MurC), and compare their expression level and purity with other expression systems. We also discuss the use of minimal media with supplements versus rich media and cell growth strategies to optimize the protein yield in general and for isotope labeling.	0
12418992	Factors that promote and prevent preparation for future care needs: perceptions of older Canadian, German, and US. women. The risk of needing help with household tasks or of requiring care in old age increases. Using semi-structured, qualitative interviews, beliefs about the usefulness versus uselessness of planning ahead for future care needs (FCN) were investigated in 23 East German, 10 U.S., and 10 Canadian elderly-community dwelling women (> or= 65 years). Primary reasons in favor of planning for FCN were: gaining a feeling of security regarding the future, avoiding being a burden to potential helpers, and coping with one's present health conditions. Factors that prevent planning for FCN were: the difficulty foreseeing FCN, the lack of resources to plan, and low levels of perceived vulnerability. The women dealt with the contradictions between these factors that promote and prevent preparation by making general plans which could be adapted in the case of needing help by developing alternative plans or by avoidance of thinking about possible future health crises.	0
15108461	[Obstructive respiration disorders during sleep and disorders of cardiac rhythm]. AIM: To investigate the impact of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) on circadian profile of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and to determine clinical markers of OSA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 52 patients (31 males, 21 females, body mass index 30.5 +/- 5.8 kg/m2) with IHD admitted to hospital for ventricular extrasystole and paroxysmal cardiac fibrillation filled in questionnaires, were examined anthropometrically, with nocturnal cardiorespiration and holter monitoring. Cluster and correlation-regression mathematical analyses of the findings were made. RESULTS: OSA was detected in 42 (80.8%) patients. Patients with primarily nocturnal arrhythmia, compared to those with diurnal arrhythmia had a significantly higher index apnea/hypopnea (29.2 and 21.5 vs 4.4, respectively), more pronounced fall in saturation (12.9 and 9.4% vs 4.9%, respectively) and lower body mass index. In 12 (23%) patients arrhythmia arose in parallel with episodes of sleep apnea/hypopnea. Mathematical analysis determined the following clinical markers of sleep respiratory disorders: regular intensive nocturnal snoring, body mass index > 25 kg/m2 and diurnal drowsiness > 15 scores by Epworth scale. CONCLUSION: ORDS may provoke cardiac arrhythmia in patients with IHD.	0
18525203	Validity of subject self-report for acne. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Acne prevalence studies often use subject self-report as data source. Our aim was to evaluate the validity of acne self-report. METHODS: Responses of university students to an acne questionnaire were compared to the trained observer's concurrent examination of acne. The validity of self-report was measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Agreement was measured by Cohen's kappa and correct classification percentage. RESULTS: The sensitivity of self-report was 0.55 (95% CI 0.47-0.63), the specificity was 0.72 (95% CI 0.63-0.80), the positive predictive value was 0.70 (95% CI 0.61-0.78), and the negative predictive value was 0.57 (95% CI 0.49-0.65). Cohen's kappa was 0.26 (95% CI 0.15-0.38) and correct classification percentage was 63. CONCLUSIONS: Validity of self-report was moderate at best and agreement was fair, indicating that college students could not accurately report that they have acne. This is likely not sufficient for clinical or research activities or to assure that individuals who self-guide their acne therapy actually have acne.	0
17005851	Oculomotor instabilities in zebrafish mutant belladonna: a behavioral model for congenital nystagmus caused by axonal misrouting. A large fraction of homozygous zebrafish mutant belladonna (bel) larvae display a reversed optokinetic response (OKR) that correlates with failure of the retinal ganglion cells to cross the midline and form the optic chiasm. Some of these achiasmatic mutants display strong spontaneous eye oscillations (SOs) in the absence of motion in the surround. The presentation of a stationary grating was necessary and sufficient to evoke SO. Both OKR reversal and SO depend on vision and are contrast sensitive. We built a quantitative model derived from bel fwd (forward) eye behaviors. To mimic the achiasmatic condition, we reversed the sign of the retinal slip velocity in the model, thereby successfully reproducing both reversed OKR and SO. On the basis of the OKR data, and with the support of the quantitative model, we hypothesize that the reversed OKR and the SO can be completely attributed to RGC misrouting. The strong resemblance between the SO and congenital nystagmus (CN) seen in humans with defective retinotectal projections implies that CN, of so far unknown etiology, may be directly caused by a projection defect.	0

9094059	Hypercortisolism after stroke--partly cytokine-mediated? Increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is common early after stroke. Hypercortisolism is a prominent manifestation. Normally the secretion of cortisol is regulated by adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), but recently an ACTH/cortisol dissociation after stroke was reported. Cytokines may influence the HPA axis, and plasma IL-6 levels are elevated following stroke. We investigated correlations between cortisol, ACTH, and cytokines, and between blood pressure and blood hormone levels early after stroke in seven stroke patients. All had neurological symptoms secondary to brain infarctions. Blood samples for analysis of cortisol, ACTH, IL-6, TNF alpha, norepinephrine, and epinephrine were collected four times daily, and 24-h blood pressure was measured. Plasma IL-6, but not ACTH, correlated significantly to serum cortisol. Catecholamine levels correlated with cytokine and cortisol levels. This study suggests that several routes for HPA-axis dysregulation is present early after stroke. Cytokine release may play an important role in this situation.	0

18276778	Long-term engraftment of bone marrow-derived cells in the intimal hyperplasia lesion of autologous vein grafts. Intimal hyperplasia of autologous vein grafts is a critical problem affecting the long-term patency of many types of vascular reconstruction. Within intimal hyperplasia lesions, smooth muscle cells are a major component, playing an essential role in the pathological process. Given that bone marrow-derived cells may differentiate into smooth muscle cells in the neointima of injured arteries, we hypothesized that the bone marrow may serve as a source for some of the smooth muscle cells within intimal hyperplasia lesions of vein grafts. To test this hypothesis, we used an established mouse model for intimal hyperplasia in wild-type mice that had been transplanted with bone marrow from a green fluorescent protein (GFP+/+) transgenic mouse. High-resolution confocal microscopy analysis performed 2 and 8 weeks after grafting demonstrated expression of GFP in 5.4 +/- 0.8% and 11.9 +/- 2.3%, respectively, of smooth muscle cells within intimal hyperplasia lesions. By 16 weeks, GFP expression in smooth muscle cells was not detected by immunohistochemistry; however, real-time PCR revealed that 20.2 +/- 1.7% of the smooth muscle cells captured from the neointima lesion by laser capture microdissection at 16 weeks contained GFP DNA. Our results suggest that bone marrow-derived cells differentiated into smooth muscle cells within the intimal lesion and may provide a novel clinical approach for decreasing intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.	0

12840234	Outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention among elderly patients in cardiogenic shock: a multicenter, decade-long experience. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the characteristics and hospital mortality rate for elderly patients in cardiogenic shock undergoing emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Early revascularization for patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock is recommended for patients < 75 years of age. This age-restricted recommendation is based upon evidence that elderly shock patients undergoing early revascularization have extremely high hospital mortality rates. The real world mortality rate for elderly shock patients undergoing emergent PCI has not been determined. METHODS: We examined a decade-long experience in our prospective registry of consecutive PCIs in Northern New England to assess the generalizability of these findings. Characteristics and hospital mortality were compared for elderly ( 75 years old) versus non-elderly (< 75 years old) patients. Predictors of hospital survival were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2000, a total of 310 out of 52,418 patients (0.59%) had PCI for cardiogenic shock, twenty-four percent of whom were elderly. Procedural characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Independent predictors of mortality for both groups were older age and the absence of collaterals; during the stent era (1997 2000), significant predictors were lack of stent placement and diabetes mellitus. The mortality rate for elderly shock patients undergoing PCI was 46%, which is significantly less than previously reported in randomized clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Real world selection of elderly shock patients for PCI is possible with mortality rates far less than seen in randomized trials.	0
18759226	Transcriptional profiling of a mice plague model: insights into interaction between Yersinia pestis and its host. Despite the importance of pneumonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis, a few is known about the interaction between Y. pestis and its host at the molecular level during the pneumonic plague development. In this study, we employed an intranasally challenged plague model in mice for investigating the kinetics of the disease progression by transcriptional profiling of Y. pestis and mice using qRT-PCR and microarray, respectively. The increasing transcription of important virulence genes of Y. pestis and of mice genes involving in immune and inflammatory defensive responses, and responses to stimuli, presents an overview of interaction between Y. pestis and mice during development of pneumonic plague. The early and persisting up-regulation of caf 1, psa A and lcr V in vivo indicated their role in resisting the host innate immune responses. The up-regulation of fur, ybt A and hms H in vivo reflected the ability of Y. pestis for acquiring iron. The transcription regulators, including pho P, oxy R and omp R, were up-regulated during plague development, suggesting their roles in interaction between Y. pestis and mice. Many genes encoding cytokines, such as IL2, IL-1B, CXCL2, CXCL5, CCL20, CD14 and TNFRSF13B, were up-regulated during the infection, confirming the report that they are important mediators to activate host responses to invading pathogens. The up-regulation of some genes encoding important virulent factors of Y. pestis and expression alterations of some genes encoding cytokines in the host reflect the interaction between the pathogen and the host, which will help us better understand plague pathogenesis.	0
18550405	Yolk androgens as pleiotropic mediators of physiological processes: a mechanistic review. Avian egg yolks are made up of complex mixtures of physiologically relevant substances. Androgens, in particular, accumulate in yolks in variable amounts based on social and environmental conditions experienced by laying females, and using experimental elevations of yolk androgen content, researchers have unveiled potent physiological and behavioral effects on offspring. These patterns and effects are exciting in an adaptive context, as the transfer of endogenously-produced substances such as androgens to egg yolks may allow fine manipulation of offspring phenotype to maximize reproductive success. However, to gain an in-depth understanding of how yolk androgens function in an adaptive context, we must first understand the complex entanglement of physiological and endocrine interrelationships that change after exposure to yolk androgens. Here, we take a comparative approach towards a discussion of how yolk androgens can simultaneously affect multiple body systems within developing birds, ultimately resulting in the large-scale phenotypic endpoints that may represent adaptive consequences of exposure to elevated levels of yolk androgens.	0
8581008	Health control policies in fish viral diseases. Viral infections cause significant levels of mortality in intensive fish farming. There is no treatment, and, because vaccination is not yet feasible, prevention is only possible through fish health control measures or policies. The transportation of fish or fish products represents a major means of virus dissemination. For this reason, official systems of inspection and certification have focused mainly on exported shipments. A need for unanimity among the various systems has been recognized. Standardized rules and procedures have been encouraged by the international organizations (the FAO and the OIE) through the publication of technical documents, guidelines and codes. Health control systems can be effective, but they may be affected by many socio-economic factors and should always be associated with other preventive measures.	0
18620612	Measurement of macular pigment optical density and distribution using the steady-state visual evoked potential. The purpose of this study was to specify isoluminance at different retinal eccentricities and to characterize macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and distribution using the steady-state visual evoked potential (VEP). Redgreen (B/G) gratings were generated within two circular stimulus fields (radius = 0.55 or 1.1 deg) and within four annular fields (maximum mean radius = 6.0 deg) on a color monitor. Temporal frequency was 15 Hz. Isoluminance was determined for each stimulus using minimum flicker photometry. Steady-state onset-offset VEPs were recorded to the same annular stimuli as the luminance ratio between adjacent chromatic components was changed from 0.25 to 0.85 in 11 automated steps (0.5 representing photometric isoluminance). Fourier analysis showed that the power of the first harmonic was minimized at the isoluminant ratio specific to each subject. Relative OD was computed by comparing the isoluminant ratio at any location with that for the most eccentric annulus. To compensate for the broadband characteristics of the monitor, OD values were corrected according to minimum flicker measurements made through known concentrations of carotenoid solution. MPOD was additionally measured using minimum motion photometry.There was high correlation between the isoluminant ratios determined by minimum flicker and VEPs for both R/G and B/G stimulation (r = 0.91, P < 0.005, slope = 1). Calibrated OD values computed from VEP estimates of B/G isoluminance correlated with those derived from minimum flicker (r = 0.96, P < 0.0005, slope = 0.85) and motion photometry (r = 0.94, P < 0.0005, slope = 0.88). OD values derived from B/G VEPs increased toward the fovea and corresponded closely with minimum flicker and minimum motion assessment of MP distribution profiles. The steady-state VEP can be used to determine isoluminance at different retinal eccentricities. MPOD and distribution can be measured by steady-state VEPs to B/G stimuli.	0

16595680	KLF5 Interacts with p53 in regulating survivin expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The Kruppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a transcription factor that regulates cellular signaling involved in cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Here, we report that KLF5 interacts with tumor suppressor p53 in regulating the expression of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein survivin, which may play a role in pathological process of cancer. The core promoter region of survivin contains multiple GT-boxes that have been characterized as KLF5 response elements. Deletion and mutation analyses as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation and electronic mobility shift assay indicated that KLF5 binds to the core survivin promoter and strongly induces its activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that KLF5 protein is able to bind to p53 and abrogate the p53-regulated repression of survivin. Transfection of KLF5 into a KLF5-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line EU-8 enhanced survivin expression, and conversely, silencing of KLF5 by small interfering RNA in a KLF5-overexpressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line EU-4 down-regulated survivin expression. The KLF5 small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of survivin sensitized EU-4 cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. These findings identify a novel regulatory pathway for the expression of survivin under the control of KLF5 and p53. Deregulation of this pathway may result in overexpression of survivin in cancer, thus contributing to drug resistance.	1

12689019	Current-induced spin-wave excitations in a single ferromagnetic layer. Evidence for a current-induced spin-transfer torque effect has been investigated in a series of point contacts to single ferromagnetic layers. At specific current densities, abrupt resistance changes, similar to those attributed to current-induced spin-wave excitations in multilayers, have been observed for one current polarity. The critical current for these resistance changes depends linearly on the external field applied perpendicular to the layer. The observed effect is interpreted as a current-driven heterogeneous instability in an otherwise uniform ferromagnetic layer.	0
15587309	Clinical trial of Mirazid in treatment of human fascioliasis, Ezbet El-Bakly (Tamyia Center) Al-Fayoum Governorate. A field survey was done in Ezbet El-Bakly, Al-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt to assess the efficacy and safety of Mirazid in the treatment of human fascioliasis. Among 1019 individuals examined for parasitosis, the prevalence of fascioliasis was 1.7% and the geometric mean egg count (GMEC) was 33.2 eggs/gram stools. About 23.5% of the fascioliasis patients were asymptomatic. The most frequent symptoms were abdominal dis\\tension and flatulence (76.5%), right hypochondrial pain (17.6%) and epigastric pain (17.6%). The most prevalent signs were pallor (52.9%,), tender right hypochondrium (23.5%) and tinge of jaundice (17.6%). All cases were treated by Mirazid as two capsules (600 mg) on an empty stomach an hour before breakfast for six consecutive days and followed up clinically and parasitologically. The parasitological cure rate, two and three months after treatment was 88.2% and 94.1% with an overt clinical cure without any side-effects. The cases not completely responding to a single course of treatment showed a marked reduction of the egg intensity. It was concluded that Mirazid (or Myrrh extract of Commiphora molmol) is safe and effective in the treatment of human fascioliasis under the field conditions.	0
18359482	Influence of vitrification on mouse metaphase II oocyte spindle dynamics and chromatin alignment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate influences of vitrification and warming of metaphase II (MII) mouse oocytes on survival, spindle dynamics, spindle morphology, and chromatin alignment on metaphase plates. DESIGN: Experimental animal study. SETTING: University animal laboratory. ANIMAL(S): Eight-week-old B6D2F1 mice. INTERVENTION(S): Denuded MII oocytes were used fresh (control), exposed to vitrification/warming solutions (Sol Expos), or vitrified and warmed (Vitr). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Oocyte recovery and survival after warming and the influence of solution exposure and cryopreservation on spindle dynamics and chromatin alignment. RESULT(S): Cryopreservation of two or 10 oocytes per straw resulted in recovery (100% +/- 0% and 95% +/- 4%, respectively; mean +/- SE) and survival (95% +/- 2% and 98% +/- 2%, respectively). Immediately after warming (Vitr), significantly fewer oocytes assessed with immunocytochemistry contained spindles, compared with control and Sol Expos. When oocytes were placed into a 37 degrees C environment for 2 hours after exposure or warming, the ability to recognize spindles by immunocytochemistry was not significantly different between groups. Using live-cell time-lapse imaging with LC-Polscope, similar time-dependent spindle formation dynamics were observed. At 2 hours after collection or treatment, spindle morphology and length were not significantly different between the groups, nor was the incidence of aberrant alignment of chromatin on metaphase plates. CONCLUSION(S): Immediately after warming of vitrified MII oocytes, beta-tubulin is depolymerized and chromatin remains condensed on the metaphase plate. Within a 2-hour period, beta-tubulin repolymerizes, forming morphologically normal metaphase spindles with properly aligned chromatin.	0

18028353	Feather mites and birds: an interaction mediated by uropygial gland size? Feather mites (Arachnida: Acari: Astigmata) feed mainly on secretions of the uropygial gland of birds. Here, we use analyses corrected for phylogeny and body size to show that there is a positive correlation between the size of this gland and mite abundance in passerine birds at an interspecific level during the breeding season, suggesting that the gland mediates interactions between mites and birds. As predicted on the basis of hypothesized waterproofing and antibiotic functions of uropygial gland secretions, riparian/marsh bird species had larger glands and higher mite loads than birds living in less mesic terrestrial environments. An unexpected pattern was a steeper relationship between mite load and gland size in migratory birds than in residents. If moderate mite loads are beneficial to a host but high loads detrimental, this could create complex selection regimes in which gland size influences mite load and vice versa. Mites may exert selective pressures on gland size of their hosts that has resulted in smaller glands among migratory bird species, suggesting that smaller glands may have evolved in these birds to attenuate a possible detrimental effect of feather mites when present in large numbers.	0
7509901	Intracoronary infusion of E6010 has more potent thrombolytic activity than tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in dogs: a higher plasma level of E6010 than t-PA causes potent thrombolytic activity. We examined the thrombolytic properties of a novel modified human tissue plasminogen activator (PA) (E6010), in which cysteine 84 is replaced by serine, and which has a prolonged biologic half-life (t1/2). We compared the thrombolytic efficacy of continuous intracoronary (i.c.) infusion of E6010 with that of recombinant human tissue PA (rt-PA) in a canine model with copper coil-induced 1-h-old coronary artery thrombi and also compared the relation between thrombolytic efficacy and plasma clearance represented by pharmacokinetic parameters of i.c.-infused E6010 and rt-PA. Sixty-minute E6010 and rt-PA i.c. infusions were compared. The thrombolytic effects of i.c.-infused E6010 and rt-PA, represented by time to reperfusion (TR), reperfusion rate at 60 min (RR), and reocclusion rates at 60 min after reperfusion (OR) were as follows. E6010: Dose 0.06, 0.15, 0.3 (mg/kg/h); TR 25 +/- 10, 15 +/- 10, 13 +/- 5 (min); RR 100, 100, 100 (%); and OR 0, 0, 17 (%), respectively. Recombinant t-PA: Dose 0.06, 0.15, 0.3 (mg/kg/h); TR 47 +/- 12, 18 +/- 17, 14 +/- 4 (min); RR 50, 75, 100 (%); and OR 100, 33, 33 (%), respectively. These findings indicate that E6010 has more potent thrombolytic activity than rt-PA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
8269978	Actin dynamics in human neutrophils during adhesion and phagocytosis is controlled by changes in intracellular free calcium. The role of changes in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the assembly and disassembly of actin during adhesion and phagocytosis was evaluated. Rhodamine-phalloidin staining combined with quantitative fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to measure local F-actin changes in single adherent human neutrophils phagocytosing yeast particles on different surfaces and under different calcium conditions. Cells were suspended in a) calcium-containing medium (CCM) or b) calcium-free medium (CFM) or c) were first depleted of calcium (i.e., MAPT/AM-loaded in CFM) and then suspended in CFM (MAPT). In parallel, local [Ca2+]i changes were monitored using a fura-2 ratio imaging system. In CCM or CFM, attachment to the substrate and formation of pseudopods around a yeast particle generated, within a few seconds, rises in [Ca2+]i, both around the phagosome and in the cell body. During continued phagocytosis, [Ca2+]i was more elevated around the phagosome compared to the rest of the cell. No [Ca2+]i fluctuations were observed in MAPT cells. Adhesion and phagocytosis led to a several-fold increase in F-actin. The increase was transient in cells in CCM and CFM, but remained high in Ca-depleted neutrophils. A distinct ring of F-actin was formed around a phagosome with a yeast particle. Twenty min after ingestion the amount of this actin decreased more than 50% in CCM and CFM cells but increased by 40 to 100% in MAPT cells. The accumulation of F-actin in MAPT cells was reduced to resting levels by adding Ca2+ and ionomycin after ingestion. This treatment reestablished the periphagosomal [Ca2+]i rises, as observed in CCM cells. In conclusion, the present study shows that the actin polymerization, occurring in human neutrophils during adhesion and phagocytosis, is not influenced by changes in [Ca2+]i, whereas the subsequent depolymerization is. The accumulation of actin filaments around the phagosome in calcium-depleted cells could be involved in the inhibition of phagolysosome fusion seen in the absence of [Ca2+]i changes (Jaconi et al., J. Cell Biol. 110, 1555-1564 (1990)). This suggests that the actin network, controlled by [Ca2+]i, regulates the movement of granules during phagocytosis.	0

9421692	Influenza vaccines. A reappraisal of their use. The medical and economic burden associated with annual influenza activity is well known and well documented. Yearly updated influenza vaccines are available to combat the disease and its consequences. In many countries, less than half of the high risk patients are being vaccinated, despite recommendations to do so by national health authorities. Scientific evidence on the safety, tolerance, efficacy and effectiveness of currently existing inactivated influenza vaccines unambiguously demonstrates the favourable benefit/risk ratio of influenza immunisations for high risk patients and strongly suggests an economic benefit of influenza immunisation programmes. Because of both the successful world-wide efforts of the WHO to optimise the chance of an adequate antigenic match between vaccine and epidemic strains each year and the available scientific data about the inactivated influenza vaccines, influenza immunisations should be offered annually to high risk patients. On the basis of the available evidence, offering a vaccination to such patients should be considered an ethical obligation.	0

8451395	Percutaneous enteral alimentation: gastrostomy versus gastrojejunostomy. Scintigraphy was used to detect gastroesophageal reflux, determine whether percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) tubes cause reflux, and help in the choice between PG tubes versus percutaneous gastrojejunostomy (PGJ) tubes. During a 2-year period, 46 patients were evaluated with scintigraphy immediately before and 1 week after PG tube placement. Findings in the pre- and postplacement reflux studies were the same in 39 patients (85%). Proof of reflux on either study was considered an indication for conversion to the PGJ tube; at least one study was positive for reflux in 21 patients (46%). All patients were followed up for tube complications, pneumonia, and cause of death. During follow-up, six of 24 patients correctly maintained with PG tubes (25%) and 18 patients with PGJ tubes (39%) developed pneumonia, the cause of death in four of 24 patients with PG tubes (17%) and five of 18 patients with PGJ tubes (28%). The PG tube does not induce reflux, and scintigraphy is useful in selection of patients who can be safely maintained with the PG tube without an increase in the morbidity or mortality associated with reflux and aspiration.	0

11358962	Characterization of a new subfamily of winged-helix/forkhead (Fox) genes that are expressed in the lung and act as transcriptional repressors. Epithelial gene expression in the lung is thought to be regulated by the coordinate activity of several different families of transcription factors including the Fox family of winged-helix/forkhead DNA-binding proteins. In this report, we have identified and characterized two members of this Fox gene family, Foxp1 and Foxp2, and show that they comprise a new subfamily of Fox genes expressed in the lung. Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed at high levels in the lung as early as E12.5 of mouse development with Foxp2 expression restricted to the airway epithelium. In addition, Foxp1 and Foxp2 are expressed at lower levels in neural, intestinal, and cardiovascular tissues during development. Upon differentiation of the airway epithelium along the proximal-distal axis, Foxp2 expression becomes restricted to the distal alveolar epithelium whereas Foxp1 expression is observed in the distal epithelium and mesenchyme. Foxp1 and Foxp2 can regulate epithelial lung gene transcription as was demonstrated by their ability to dramatically repress the mouse CC10 promoter and, to a lesser extent, the human surfactant protein C promoter. In addition, GAL4 fusion proteins encoding subdomains of Foxp1 and Foxp2 demonstrate that an independent and homologous transcriptional repression domain lies within the N-terminal end of the proteins. Together, these studies suggest that Foxp1 and Foxp2 are important regulators of lung epithelial gene transcription.	1
22975248	Relaxation and modulation interference effects in two-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM). Two-pulse electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) line widths are influenced by transverse electron spin relaxation, which is in turn induced by local field fluctuations. Simultaneous analysis of the decays of the unmodulated and modulated parts of the ESEEM signal provides deeper insight into the relaxation of a spin system consisting of an electron spin 1/2 coupled to N(I) nuclei with spin 1/2. Standard two-pulse ESEEM formulas either do not account for relaxation or assume uniform relaxation for all lines. In general, the relaxation rates on allowed and forbidden transitions may not be the same. Experimental results obtained on a single crystal of Cu(II)-doped L-histidine suggest that such a difference exists. Theoretical considerations show that in such a case the product rule for two-pulse ESEEM does not extend to expressions including relaxation. Product rules in general do not properly account for relaxation in three-pulse ESEEM and HYSCORE experiments. Decay of the apparently non-oscillatory part of the two-pulse echo may be strongly affected by modulation interference. Such interference of difference frequencies of matrix nuclei may cause a rather flat initial feature, which was previously attributed solely to non-exponential phase relaxation of electron spin transitions due to spin diffusion of the matrix nuclei. In addition, the sometimes observed drastic initial decay of the time domain signal is related to modulation interference of multiple-quantum coherences that arise from a strong cross-suppression effect.	0
19569307	Separating the men from the boys: masculinity and maturity in understandings of shell shock in Britain. This article examines gendered discourses of shell shock in Britain during the First World War. Located within the context of the ideas about shell shock as a form of male hysteria put forward by Elaine Showalter, it examines the ways in which the contemporary discourses of soldiers, medical professionals and popular novelists used ideas of maturity and self-control to understand a condition that appeared to undermine both the war effort and national masculinity. It argues that contemporary understandings of authority and maturity helped to normalize shell shock as a medical condition, thereby lessening its perceived threat to society.	0
22136364	Communication and AAC in the lives of adults with autism: the stories of their older parents. The aim of this study was to explore the communication experiences, particularly those related to augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), of older parents who had an adult son or daughter with autism. A narrative analysis of in-depth interviews with 16 older parents indicated that the majority had rarely spontaneously mentioned AAC or other communication interventions. Most did not express the need for such services. Yet, communication breakdown featured prominently in parents' narratives about interactions with their son or daughter. The quality of the communication between older parents and their offspring with autism constituted important sources of both gratification and strain in parents' roles as caregivers. Reasons for the current lack of communication interventions are discussed, along with implications for communication and AAC service provision.	0
9878938	Influences of sex and smoking habits on anticoagulant activity in low-molecular-weight heparin treatment of unstable coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND: In the FRISC trial, dalteparin 120 IU/kg body weight twice daily for unstable coronary artery disease was safe and reduced the risk of new coronary events. This risk reduction was maintained during the following extended treatment with a fixed dose of 7500 IU dalteparin once daily. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minor bleeding was more frequent in women compared with men: relative risk (CI) 2.88 (1.78 to 4.67) during the weight-adjusted and 2.36 (1.37 to 2.63) during the fixed dose treatment. The anti-Xa activity determined in samples (n = 175) obtained during the acute phase treatment was higher in women compared with men (P <.001) and in nonsmokers compared with smokers (<.001) in multiple regression analysis. Also, during the fixed-dose treatment (n = 131) an independent relation between anti-Xa activity and sex (P <.001), but not smoking habits, persisted. CONCLUSION: To improve future low-molecular-weight heparin dose regimens for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes, it might be important to consider the influence of sex and smoking habits.	0
10150765	Social relationships and physical activity in health club members. The results of this study support the hypothesis that social variables are related to exercise behavior and satisfaction. Exercise frequency was related to having friends at the health club and socializing outside the club with people met at the club. Frequency of skipping workouts was negatively associated with having friends at the club. The results shown in Table 2 suggest that of the three social variables, socializing outside the club with people met at the club was the best predictor of exercise frequency, having friends at the club was the best predictor of frequency of skipping, and exercising with a friend was the best predictor of exercise satisfaction. The three social variables explained 11% of the variance in exercise frequency, 8% of the variance in skipping frequency, and 4% of the variance in satisfaction. These findings suggest that friendships that involve exercising together and the social contacts that result from exercising in public places such as health clubs may motivate exercise behavior. A large segment of the population may derive social, as well as physical, benefits from exercise, and these social benefits may encourage them to adhere to their exercise programs. The significant interaction of marital status and socialization with people met at the club in the prediction of exercise frequency suggests that social interaction may be a more important motivator of exercise behavior for single people than for people who are married or have significant others. Exercise programs involving social interaction may be especially effective for single, divorced, or widowed people.	0

Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.	0

15212871	A consumer involvement model for health technology assessment in Canada. Similar to other health policy initiatives, there is a growing movement to involve consumers in decisions affecting their treatment options. Access to treatments can be impacted by decisions made during a health technology assessment (HTA), i.e., the rigorous assessment of medical interventions such as drugs, vaccines, devices, materials, medical and surgical procedures and systems. The purpose of this paper was to empirically assess the interest and potential mechanisms for consumer involvement in HTA by identifying what health consumer organizations consider meaningful involvement, examining current practices internationally and developing a model for involvement based on identified priorities and needs. Canadian health consumer groups representing the largest disease or illness conditions reported a desire for involvement in HTA and provided feedback on mechanisms for facilitating their involvement.	0

8287579	Clinical implications of hyperinsulinaemia in women. In the polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperinsulinaemia is commonly found in women with hirsutism, oligomenorrhoea and acanthosis nigricans and this subset of patients possess adverse risk factors for coronary artery disease, particularly reduced HDL2 concentrations. Conversely, raised serum insulin concentrations are not common in women with PCOS in whom raised serum LH concentrations or regular menstrual cycles are present. We postulate that both direct ovarian and indirect actions of insulin (through changes in IGFI-I, IGFBP-I and SHBG concentrations) play important roles in determining androgen concentrations in women. Many intriguing questions follow from this link between the control of nutrition and reproduction and many old observations required re-examination in this new light. Vital to our understanding in this field will be the cause of moderate hyperinsulinaemia, the action of insulin on the normal ovary, and the importance of adverse surrogate risk factors for heart disease in hyperinsulinaemic women.	0

17675518	Inhibition of experimental allergic airways disease by local application of a cell-penetrating dominant-negative STAT-6 peptide. Allergic airways disease is initiated and perpetuated by an aberrant Th2 inflammatory response regulated in part by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, each of which induces activation of the STAT-6 transcription factor. Data from murine models indicate that the clinical manifestations of acute asthma are STAT-6 dependent, and thus, STAT-6 is a target for drug development in allergic airways disease. We designed a novel chimeric peptide (STAT-6 inhibitory peptide (STAT-6-IP)) comprised of a sequence predicted to bind to and inhibit STAT-6, fused to a protein transduction domain, to facilitate cellular uptake of the STAT-6-binding peptide. Our data demonstrate that the STAT-6-IP inhibited OVA-induced production of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 in vitro. In contrast, the STAT-6-IP did not affect production of IFN-gamma, demonstrating specificity for Th2 cytokine inhibition. Following intranasal administration, the STAT-6-IP was localized to epithelial cells in the airways. Finally, in in vivo murine models of allergic rhinitis and asthma, intranasal delivery of the STAT-6-IP inhibited OVA-induced lung inflammation and mucus production as well as accumulation of eosinophils and IL-13 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and OVA-dependent airway hyperresponsiveness. Together these data show that local application of cell-penetrating peptide inhibitors of STAT-6 has significant potential for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma.	0
11310081	Effects of a single music therapy intervention on anxiety, discomfort, satisfaction, and compliance with screening guidelines in outpatients undergoing flexible sigmoidoscopy. Screening flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) is an effective tool for the detection of colon cancer. Nonetheless, persons are reluctant to undergo FS for a variety of reasons such as anxiety, discomfort, and the possibility of abnormal findings. Nurses caring for FS patients can implement interventions to allay anxiety and promote comfort in an effort to enhance satisfaction and future compliance. Music therapy is one nonpharmacologic intervention that has been shown to be effective in allaying anxiety, reducing discomfort, and promoting satisfaction in other patient populations. A two-group pretest, posttest experimental design with repeated measures study recruited 64 subjects undergoing FS from one Midwestern tertiary care center. Subjects were randomly assigned to a control condition of usual procedural care or to an experimental condition of music therapy during the examination. State and trait anxieties were measured at pretest. State anxiety, discomfort, satisfaction, and perceived compliance with future screening were measured after the procedure. Subjects in the music group reported less anxiety and discomfort than subjects in the control group. There were no differences on satisfaction ratings or perceived compliance with screening guidelines. Nurses caring for patients undergoing screening FS can offer music therapy as one nonpharmacologic intervention to ameliorate anxiety and reduce discomfort.	0
23662916	Matching structural, effective, and functional connectivity: a comparison between structural equation modeling and ancestral graphs. In this study, we examined the accuracy of ancestral graphs (AGs) to study effective connectivity in the brain. Unlike most other methods that estimate effective connectivity, an AG is able to explicitly model missing brain regions in a network model. We compared AGs with the conventional structural equation models (SEM). We used both methods to estimate connection strengths between six regions of interest of the visual cortex based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data of a motion perception task. In order to examine which method is more accurate to estimate effective connectivity, we compared the connection strengths of the AG and SEM models with connection probabilities resulting from probabilistic tractography obtained from diffusion tensor images. This was done by correlating the connection strengths of the best fitting AG and SEM models with the connection probabilities of the probabilistic tractography models. We show that, in general, AGs result in more accurate models to estimate effective connectivity than SEM. The reason for this is that missing regions are taken into account when modeling with AG but not when modeling with SEM: AG can be used to explicitly test the assumption of missing regions. If the set of regions is complete, SEM and AG perform about equally well.	0
20165167	Pulse distortion in the ultimate multimode optical fiber. The shape of the impulse reponse of a step index, multimode fiber of circular cross section with material limited by Rayleigh scattering only is nearly invariant with fiber length L, unless L is so large that the signal has suffered an enormous scattering loss. The percent fraction of pulse energy responsible for distortion by scattering approximately 8.63 (1 - n(2)(CL)/n(2)(CO)) W(dB), where W(dB) is the associated energy reduction in decibels due to scattering from the core, and n(CL), n(CO) are the refractive indexes of cladding and core, respectively. WdB is nearly equal to length in kilometers for highly transparent material.	0

18058082	[Chronic spinal subdural hematoma]. Compared with spinal epidural hematomas, spinal subdural hematomas are rare; chronic forms are even more uncommon. These hematomas are associated not only with lumbar puncture and spinal trauma, but also with coagulopathies, vascular malformations and tumors. Compression of the spinal cord and the cauda equina means that the patients develop increasing back or radicular pain, followed by paraparesis and bladder and bowel paralysis, so that in most cases surgical decompression is carried out. On magnetic resonance imaging these hematomas present as thoracic or lumbar subdural masses, their signal intensity varying with the age of the hematoma. We report the clinical course and the findings revealed by imaging that led to the diagnosis in three cases of chronic spinal subdural hematoma.	0

21709721	Churg-Strauss syndrome with necrosis of toe tips. Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is a granulomatous necrotizing vasculitis of unknown etiology associated with bronchial asthma. Despite affecting small to medium-sized vessels, necrosis of the digits due to vasculitis is extremely rare. We report a case of CSS with necrosis of the toe tips. A 37-year-old woman with asthma, who had been diagnosed with CSS 2 years ago, was admitted to our hospital with an exacerbation of CSS. The patient had a high grade fever and complained of abdominal pain and numbness of the lower extremities. Blood examination revealed marked eosinophilia. The fever pattern, abdominal pain and blood eosinophilia showed improvement by combination treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide. However, the color of her right toe tips changed, and necrosis finally resulted despite antithrombotic therapy. Arteriography showed narrowing of the dorsalis pedis artery and of the more peripheral arteries of her right leg. Stump plasty with negative pressure dressing therapy for the toe tips, but not amputation, was done to preserve the leg function. While numbness of the extremities remained, no recurrence of necrosis was seen. Clinicians need to be aware that rare complications of CSS, including necrosis of the digits, can occur.	0
8208866	[A reply to Dr. Bidzan's article \"Relationship between the normal aging ad Alzheimer's dementia. Practical implications]. In research on the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease much attention is devoted to the possible connections between this type of dementia and the ageing process of the brain alone, or the normal ageing accelerated or increased by certain adverse factors. There is cause to suppose, that normal ageing is only a certain ideal image. Indeed it is very difficult to meet an old person free from influences of adverse psychosocial and biological factors. There is no proof that these factors lead to primary degenerative dementia. To the contrary, there exist some indications that patients with Alzheimer's disease are physically healthier, than their undemented contemporaries. Epidemiological studies, neuropathological, neurochemical and genetics research, together with the clinical picture and the course of Alzheimer's disease, indicate that this is a different state from normal ageing. In research on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease it is important to establish not only risk factors, but also protective factors. Nevertheless due to the significance of Alzheimer's disease in Poland, in the nearest future, more attention will be devoted to vascular dementia. It is possible that the prevalence of vascular dementia is equal, if not greater than the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. Because of the fact that the risk factors for vascular dementia are well known, it gives a possibility of prophylaxis and treatment of this type of dementia.	0

22782628	Identification of ANAPC13 gene polymorphisms associated with body measurement traits in Bos taurus. Body measurement traits, influenced by genes and environmental factors, play numerous important roles in the value assessment of productivity and economy. There has been some indication that ANAPC13 influences adult height. We used PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing technology to identify polymorphisms in the ANAPC13 gene. A polymorphism in intron 1 (A > G at base 17) was identified and an additional polymorphic site (C > T at base 42) was also uncovered, which accompanied the previous polymorphism in more than 98% of the subjects. The two novel polymorphisms in exon 1 were assayed and potential associations with body measurement traits were evaluated in 404 individuals. Three genotypes were detected in the study group, named AACC, AGCT and GGTT. Significant differences were observed between genotypes AACC and AGCT for body length, withers height, hip height, hip width, heart girth, pin bone width. However, no associations were found among any genotypes and chest depth. We conclude that polymorphisms and mutations in non-coding regions of the ANAPC13 gene significantly affect body measurement traits.	0
8134563	Gadolinium-enhanced MR aortography. PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential for preferential arterial enhancement at magnetic resonance (MR) aortography with an intravenous infusion of paramagnetic contrast material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gadolinium chelates were administered intravenously (0.2 mmol/kg) during three-dimensional MR imaging (1.5 T) in 125 patients (77 male and 48 female patients, aged 4-86 years [mean, 66 years]) with suspected aorta or aortic branch vessel disease. RESULTS: Infusion for the duration of the MR acquisition resulted in significant preferential arterial enhancement without the confounding effects of excessive venous or background-tissue enhancement (P < 10(-5)). Angiographic or surgical correlation in 48 patients revealed an 88% sensitivity and a 97% specificity for detection of stenoses or occlusions and a 100% sensitivity and a 100% specificity for detection of aortic or iliac artery aneurysms. CONCLUSION: Preferential arterial enhancement is possible at MR aortography with an intravenous infusion of paramagnetic contrast material.	0

9358686	Which environmental variables are related to the onset of seasonal affective disorder? The regular fall-winter onset of seasonal affective disorder is believed to be related to seasonal changes in the environment. However, the high correlation among various environmental variables has made it difficult to distinguish which ones may play a causal role. Photoperiod should explain variations in onset risk across both latitude and day of the year because it varies as a function of only these 2 factors. In Study 1, the authors found this to be the case using data from 5 locations. Environmental factors that vary from year to year should explain variations in onset risk across both time of year and actual year. In Study 2, the authors examined data from 7 years at 1 location and failed to find evidence of this effect for daily hours of sunshine, mean daily temperature, and total daily radiation. Findings support photoperiod as being related to the onset of seasonal affective disorder.	0

11835734	Vascularized peripheral nerve trunk autografted in the spinal cord: a new experimental model in adult rats. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of vascularized peripheral nerve trunk autografted in spinal cord. METHODS: With modern microsurgical technique, vascularized peripheral median and ulnar nerve trunk autografted in the upper thoracic region of the spinal cord were established in 20 female adult rats. The origin and the termination of axons in the graft were studied by retrograde neuronal labeling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Cord, nerve grafts and some normal median an d ul nar nerves in the right upper limb were removed and sectioned for Bielschowsky's silver stain and haematoxylin and eosin (H_E) stain. Light and electron microscopic examination and electrophysiological examination were applied. RESULTS: The grafts were innervated by many new fibers. Studies with HRP indicated that new axons in graft were originated from intrinsic cent ral nervous system (CNS) neurons with their cell bodies from brain stem to s acral segments of spinal cord. Other axons arose from dorsal root ganglia at the level of graft and at least 19 distal segments to them. Together with electron microscopy, electrophysiological examination, silver and H_E stain, the results demonstrated that vascularized peripheral nerve trunk grafted in spinal cord attracted many neurons to grow into the nerve grafts. CONCLUSIONS: The findings implicate that CNS is able to regenerate much better in vascularized nerve autografted in spinal cord.	0
15383888	An absolute vascular milieu for primary bone graft in aesthetic nasal reconstruction. Restoration of a composite nasal defect with an aesthetically acceptable vascularized full-thickness soft tissue cover and a primary bone graft in a surgically unscarred area at the same stage requires that the flap have a complete formal inset from all the sides, for enhancement of the milieu interior. This article addresses such a situation, which required the use of a cantilever bone graft simultaneously with an interpolated midline forehead flap based on the supratrochlear vessel and transferred on a deepithelialized bridge segment, which allowed an absolute inset from all the sides. The eventual aesthetic outcome was satisfactory after a secondary surgery for nasal tip correction using conchal cartilage graft for tip framework. The procedure has allowed placement of the bone graft in an unscarred bed, with a complete inset of the vascularized full-thickness soft tissue cover. This provided the graft with the ideal vascular milieu for survival and consolidation and achieved an aesthetically acceptable soft tissue reconstruction of the nose with minimal donor-site morbidity. It obviated the need for the staged procedures and provided a secure vascular milieu for the primary bone graft.	0
14570762	Induction of multidrug resistance protein 3 (mrp3) in vivo is independent of constitutive androstane receptor. We previously demonstrated that multidrug resistance protein 3 (Mrp3/ABCC3) is induced in rat liver by phenobarbital (PB) and several other microsomal enzyme inducers that induce cytochrome P450 2B (CYP2B). CYP2B is induced by constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer binding to a phenobarbital-responsive promoter element in the CYP2B promoter. Hepatic mRNA levels of CYP2B and Mrp3 were measured in three models of altered CAR activity to determine whether CAR is also involved in the induction of Mrp3. In Wistar Kyoto rats, where males express higher CAR protein levels than females, the induction of CYP2B1/2 was significantly higher in males than in females by PB, diallyl sulfide, and trans-stilbene oxide but not oltipraz. Mrp3 was induced by each of these treatments, but in contrast to CYP2B1/2, to a similar magnitude in males and females. In male hepatocyte-specific RXRalpha-/- mice, CYP2B10 was not induced by diallyl sulfide or oltipraz but remained inducible by PB and trans-stilbene oxide after considering the decrease in basal CYP2B10 expression. Mrp3, however, was induced by PB, diallyl sulfide, trans-stilbene oxide and oltipraz in both wild-type and RXRalpha-/- mice. Additionally, constitutive expression of Mrp3 was significantly reduced in RXRalpha-/- mice. In CAR-/- mice, the robust induction of CYP2B10 by PB was completely absent. However, Mrp3 was equally induced both in wild-type and CAR-/- mice by PB. These data clearly demonstrate that induction of hepatic Mrp3 by PB and other microsomal enzyme inducers is CAR-independent and implies a role for RXRalpha in the constitutive expression of Mrp3.	1
22980648	[Effect of IL-17 on collagen I/III expression in cardiac fibroblasts isolated from BALB/c mice]. AIM: To investigate the effect of IL-17 on the expression of collagen I/III in cardiac fibroblasts and analyze its molecular mechanism. METHODS: Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from 7-14-day-old BALB/c mice and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were collected after IL-17 treatment for 0, 24, 48, 72 h. IL-17 receptors on cardiac fibroblasts were detected by PCR; the collagen I/III expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence; the PKCb, Erk1/2, NF-kB phosphorylation were investigated by Western blotting. RESULTS: IL-17RA/C was expressed on cardiac fibroblasts; after 24 h of IL-17 stimulation, the collagen I/III expression obviously increased; Western blotting showed that PKCb, Erk1/2 and NF-kB were phosphorylated on 30, 45, 45 min, respectively. CONCLUSION: IL-17 could induce the expression of collagen I/III in cardiac fibroblasts, which might be related with PKCb-ERK1/2-NF-kB phosphorylation.	0
8231773	State anxiety and blood pressure following 30 min of leg ergometry or weight training. The effect of different modes of acute exercise on state anxiety and blood pressure was examined. Collegiate varsity athletes (11 females and 15 males) completed 30-min sessions of leg cycle ergometry or weight training in a randomized order on separate days. Both exercise modes were performed within 70-80% of the maximum capacity of each subject. State anxiety, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were measured at baseline prior to exercise, immediately post-exercise, 20 min and 60 min following exercise. Repeated-measures ANOVA detected significant (P < 0.05) trial by condition effects for state anxiety and SBP. State anxiety increased (P < 0.001) immediately following weight training but returned to baseline for the remaining assessments. State anxiety decreased (P < 0.05) below baseline at 60 min following ergometry. SBP did not decrease following weight training but was reduced (P < 0.05) by 6.5 mm Hg below baseline at 60 min following ergometry. DBP did not change following either exercise mode. In summary, state anxiety and blood pressure responses to acute physical activity appear to be dependent on the exercise mode, with reductions in state anxiety and systolic blood pressure being associated with ergometry but not weight training.	0

7684518	Chemotherapy with cisplatin and continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil and bleomycin for recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Taiwan. Twenty-five patients with metastatic and/or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with cisplatin 20 mg/m2/day on days 1-5 i.v. with hydration; 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1,000 mg/m2/day by continuous infusion (CI); and bleomycin 15 mg/m2 on day 1 also by CI. These cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. Twenty-three (92%) had distant metastases. Bone was the most frequently involved site (72%), followed by lungs (44%) and liver (40%). More than half the patients (14/25) presented with at least 3 organ sites involved or had local T3/T4 or N3 lesions with a distant metastasis. The median time from relapse to start of chemotherapy was 7.5 months. We observed 1 (4%) complete response (CR), and 9 (36%) partial responses (PR). The objective response rate (CR + PR) was 40%. Hematologic toxicities were frequently encountered. Twenty (80%) patients experienced leukopenia during the treatment courses and 9 (36%) had severe (grade 3 or 4) leukopenia. Eight patients had grade 3 or 4 infections. Two of them died of sepsis and 1 succumbed to uncontrolled pneumonia. The objective response rate was inferior to other series. Possible explanation included longer delay before initiation of definitive treatment, larger tumor burdens, higher severe hematologic toxicity and lower dosage of bleomycin. The results suggested metastatic and/or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma is chemosensitive, however, for patients with large tumor burdens, more intensive chemotherapy regimens with support of hematopoietic growth factors may be required to achieve a better control.	0
24402304	ABSL-4 aerobiology biosafety and technology at the NIH/NIAID integrated research facility at Fort Detrick. The overall threat of a viral pathogen to human populations is largely determined by the modus operandi and velocity of the pathogen that is transmitted among humans. Microorganisms that can spread by aerosol are considered a more challenging enemy than those that require direct body-to-body contact for transmission, due to the potential for infection of numerous people rather than a single individual. Additionally, disease containment is much more difficult to achieve for aerosolized viral pathogens than for pathogens that spread solely via direct person-to-person contact. Thus, aerobiology has become an increasingly necessary component for studying viral pathogens that are naturally or intentionally transmitted by aerosol. The goal of studying aerosol viral pathogens is to improve public health preparedness and medical countermeasure development. Here, we provide a brief overview of the animal biosafety level 4 Aerobiology Core at the NIH/NIAID Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA.	0
12438794	Mapping the distribution of the telomeric sequence (T(2)AG(3))(n) in rock wallabies, Petrogale (Marsupialia: Macropodidae), by fluorescence in situ hybridization. ii. the lateralis complex. The distribution of the conserved vertebrate telomeric sequence (T(2)AG(3))(n) was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in the six Petrogale (rock wallabies) taxa of the lateralis complex. As expected, the (T(2)AG(3))(n) sequence was located at the termini of all chromosomes in all taxa. However, the sequence was also present at several nontelomeric (viz., interstitial and centromeric) sites. The signals identified were associated with either ancient rearrangements involved with the formation of the 2n = 22 plesiomorphic macropodine karyotype or more recent rearrangements associated with karyotypes derived from the 2n = 22 karyotype. Interstitial (T(2)AG(3))(n) signals identified on chromosomes 3 and 4 in all six species of the lateralis complex and a large centromeric signal identified on chromosome 7 in the five subspecies/races of P. lateralis appear to be related to the more ancient rearrangements. Subsequent chromosome evolution has seen these signals retained, lost, or amplified in different Petrogale lineages. Within the lateralis complex, in two submetacentric chromosome derived by recent centric fusions, the telomeric sequence was identified at or near the centromere, indicating its retention during the fusion process. In the two taxa where chromosome 3 was rearranged via a recent centromeric transposition to become an acrocentric chromosome, the telomeric signal was located interstitially.	0
16932043	Urine gonococcal/Chlamydia testing in adolescents. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will highlight the recent literature findings regarding urine-based Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing in adolescents. RECENT FINDINGS: Rates of Chlamydia trachomatis are increasing, likely due to increased detection efficiency, but have not yet begun to decrease. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is at an all-time low. Urine-based testing for sexually transmitted infections is readily available and convenient but underutilized. Interesting approaches to a more universal screening program, including self-collected, mail-in urine samples, have been shown to be effective. SUMMARY: In spite of recommendations urging universal screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae and the availability of highly accurate and convenient tests, screening rates for adolescents and young adults remain below the universal recommendations. Strategies to improve screening rates should take advantage of urine-based screening methodologies for sexually transmitted infections because of their cost-effectiveness as well as the convenience for patient and provider.	0
15131863	[Investigation of the influence of nitric oxide on the survival of a random pattern skin flap]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes of nitric oxide concentration in the distal portion of a random pattern skin flap and the influence of the exogenous L-arginine on the survival of the random pattern skin flap. METHODS: A random pattern skin flap (7 cm x 2 cm) was cranially designed and elevated on the back of a Wistar rat. An image analysis technology was used to evaluate the survival rate of the skin flap, while a biochemistry method was used to test the concentrations of the NO in the tissue. RESULTS: The survival area of the flap in the L-arginine-treated group was significantly enlarged (63.83 +/- 5.13)% (P < 0.01) in seven days postoperatively, compared with the control group (43.26 +/- 2.86)%. The NO concentration in the tissue was no statistic difference between all of the groups immediately after the operation (P > 0.05). But, the NO concentration in the control was decreasing at the beginning and then increasing slightly to reach the high level in 12 hours after the operation. It was thereafter slumped down to the baseline in 72 hours after the surgery. Although the changes in the L-arginine-treated group were quite similar to the control excepting of the extent, the NO concentration was kept in a higher level in the sequential time after the operation (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The NO concentration in skin flap tissue after the elevation was going up slightly for a short time. The exogenous L-arginine could promote the NO concentration in the random pattern skin flap to protect it from ischemic injury.	0
9342484	The influence of apoprotein epsilon 2 homozygosity on nephrotic hyperlipidemia. In the normal population, the usual effect of the epsilon 2 allele is to decrease plasma cholesterol and to increase plasma triglyceride. We report here the association of nephrotic syndrome and the apo epsilon 2 epsilon 2 genotype in which we observed a hyperlipidemia characterized by very low levels of lipoprotein lipase activity, chylomicronemia, high levels of plasma apo B, C III, E and lipoprotein(a), very low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and concentrations of cholesterol and triglyceride that are higher than expected in all the other lipoprotein fractions. When proteinuria was partially resolved and plasma albumin levels returned to normal, a residual type III hyperlipidemia was still present. These findings suggest that the combination of apo epsilon 2 homozygosity and massive proteinuria may cause considerable changes in the clearance of triglyceride rich particles probably mediated by the almost complete absence of lipolytic enzymes and a low interaction of lipoproteins with specific receptors. The apo E genotype should be investigated in nephrotic patients with chylomicronemia.	0

12680018	[Isolated pulmonary hypertension in overlap syndrome: successful treatment by methylprednisolone pulse therapy]. A 43-year-old woman was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc). On admission, absence of both thromboembolism and severe interstitial lung disease suggested that vascular damage led to PH. In addition, the patient met the criteria for the classification of SLE. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy was effective not only for the clinical symptoms but also the laboratory findings. The report of overlap syndrome associated with PH is rare. The prognosis of patients with collagen diseases associated PH has been reported to be extremely poor. Since PH in this case responded favorably to methylprednisolone pulse therapy, this therapy may be effective for PH associated with overlap syndrome.	0
23097660	Cardiorenal biomarkers in acute heart failure. Managing patients with heart failure (HF) is a challenging task within itself, but the presence of associated worsening renal function can greatly increase mortality and morbidity. Early diagnosis and treatment is the key to prevent re-hospitalizations and reduce healthcare costs. Biomarkers have long been established as highly sensitive and specific tools in diagnosing and prognosticating patients with HF. Reflecting distinct pathophysiological events and ongoing cellular insult, biomarkers have been proven superior to conventional laboratory tests. Availability of better assays and rapid analysis has allowed the use of biomarkers as point-of-care tests in the emergency department and at the patient's bed-side. Acute HF patients often go on to develop worsening renal function, termed as acute cardiorenal syndrome. The growing breadth of studies has shown the implications of combining multiple biomarkers to better chart outcomes and produce desirable results in such patients.	0

23707921	An alternative method to determine the 5' extremities of non-segmented, negative sense RNA viral genomes using positive replication intermediate 3' tailing: application to two members of the Paramyxoviridae family. Determining the sequence of non-segmented, negative sense RNA viral genomes is far from routine and often requires the application of several techniques. In this study, an existing method used currently just for determination of the genomic 3' extremity was used to determine both the 3' and 5' sequence extremities of a Newcastle disease virus and an avian metapneumovirus. This was achieved with a single 3' nucleotide tailing reaction of both the genomic RNA and the full length, positive sense, antigenomic RNA, followed by a single reverse transcription reaction targeted to the common polynucleotide tails, and then individual PCRs specific for each extremity using PCR primers derived from the sequence of the RT primer or from neighbouring virus sequences known previously. For each virus the method was employed separately. Sequences from both viruses were in agreement with those reported previously for other paramyxoviruses, yet one extra base at the 3' and one extra base at the 5' were identified for the avian metapneumovirus. In this study, importantly, the newly determined extremities maintained the complementarity known to exist between the extremities of these viruses. The method was equally successful with both viruses and can be tailored easily to function with other non-segmented, negative sense viruses through minor modification of only the primer sequences.	0
21826733	Developing country health systems and the governance of international HIV/AIDS funding. Donor country initiatives for the prevention and mitigation of HIV/AIDS are not a matter of simple burden sharing. Instead, they have brought in their wake many of the complexities and unforeseen effects that have long been associated with more general overseas development assistance. In the case of funding directed toward HIV/AIDS, these effects are by no means either secondary or easily calculable. It is widely acknowledged that there is no consensus framework on how these impacts may be defined, no framework/toolkit for the evaluation of impacts and no longitudinally significant data that could provide the substance for those evaluations. The subject of this study focuses not on the health outcomes of funding but on how donor-recipient relations could be better deliberated, negotiated and coordinated. We argue that effective leadership and governance of developing country health systems for HIV/AIDS work requires a reconfiguration of how donor-recipient relations are conceived and contracted, and for this purpose, we propose an adaptation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Paris Declaration principles of aid effectiveness.	0
15848335	A high fidelity tissue-based cardiac surgical simulator. OBJECTIVE: Issues concerning the training and certification of surgical specialists have taken on great significance in the last decade. A realistic computer-assisted, tissue-based simulator developed for use in the training of cardiac surgical residents in the conduct of a variety of cardiac surgical procedures in a low-volume cardiothoracic surgery unit of a typical developing country is described. The simulator can also be used to demonstrate the function of technology specific to cardiac surgical procedures in a way that previously has only been possible via the conduct of a procedure on a live animal or human being. METHODS: A porcine heart in a novel simulated operating theatre environment with real-time simulated haemodynamic monitoring and coronary blood flow, in arrested and beating-heart modes, is used as a training tool for surgical residents. RESULTS: Standard and beating-heart coronary arterial bypass, aortic valve replacement, aortic homograft replacement and pulmonary autograft procedures can be simulated with high degrees of realism and with the superimposition of adverse clinical scenarios requiring valid decision making and clinical judgments to be made by the trainees. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiac surgical simulation preparation described here would appear to be able to contribute positively to the training of residents in low-volume centres, as well as having the potential for application in other settings as a training tool or clinical skills assessment or accreditation device. Collaboration with larger centres is recommended in order to accurately assess the utility of this preparation as an adjunctive cardiothoracic surgical training aid.	0
17707921	Exploratory and habituation phenotype of heterozygous and homozygous COMT knockout mice. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inactivates dopamine in prefrontal cortex and is associated clinically with a schizophrenia endophenotype. Using an ethologically based approach, the phenotype of mice with heterozygous COMT deletion was characterised by decreased rearing with increased sifting and chewing. Heterozygous COMT deletion is associated with a distinctive phenotype. This differs from that which we have reported previously for heterozygous deletion of the schizophrenia risk gene neuregulin-1.	0
8656546	Effects of organizational change in the medical intensive care unit of a teaching hospital: a comparison of 'open' and 'closed' formats. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of change from an open to a closed intensive care unit (ICU) format on clinical outcomes, resource utilization, teaching, and perceptions regarding quality of care. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study; prospective economic evaluation. SETTING: Medical ICU at a university-based tertiary care center. For the open ICU, primary admitting physicians direct care of patients with input from critical care specialists via consultation. For the closed ICU, critical care specialists direct patient care. PATIENTS: Consecutive samples of 124 patients admitted under an open ICU format and 121 patients admitted after changing to a closed ICU format. Readmissions were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of hospital mortality with mortality predicted by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) system; duration of mechanical ventilation; length of stay; patient charges for radiology, laboratory, and pharmacy departments; vascular catheter use; number of interruptions of formal teaching rounds; and perceptions of patients, families, physicians, and nurses regarding quality of care and ICU function. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD APACHE II scores were 15.4 +/- 8.3 in the open ICU and 20.6 +/- 8.6 in the closed ICU (P=.001). In the closed ICU, the ratio of actual mortality (31.4 percent) to predicted mortality (40.1 percent) was 0.78. In the open ICU, the ratio of actual mortality (22.6 percent) to predicted mortality (25.2 percent) was 0.90. Mean length of stay for survivors in the open ICU was 3.9 days, and mean length of stay for survivors in the closed ICU was 3.7 days (P=.79). There were no significant differences between periods in patient charges for radiology, laboratory, or pharmacy resources. Nurses were more likely to say that they were very confident in the clinical judgment of the physician primarily responsible for patient care in the closed ICU compared with the open ICU (41 percent vs 7 percent; P<.Ol), and nurses were the group most supportive of changing to a closed ICU format before and after the study. CONCLUSIONS: Based on comparison of actual to predicted mortality, changing from an open to a closed ICU format improved clinical outcome. Although patients in the closed ICU had greater severity of illness, resource utilization did not increase.	0
15328083	The melaminophenyl arsenicals melarsoprol and melarsen oxide interfere with thiamine metabolism in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The melaminophenyl arsenical melarsoprol is the main drug used against late-stage sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei subspecies. Its active metabolite in the human body is melarsen oxide. Here, it is shown that this metabolite inhibits growth of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and that its toxicity can be abolished efficiently by thiamine (vitamin B(1)), thiamine analogues, and the pyrimidine moiety of the thiamine molecule. Uptake of melarsen oxide is mediated by a membrane protein (car1p), which is involved in the uptake of thiamine and its pyrimidine moiety. Melarsoprol is taken up by cells in a thiamine- and car1p-dependent manner but is not toxic to cells.	0

12336289	The fate of Rukmini Prasad. The case a women who was forced to undergo a tubal ligation in India in 1976 and who recently underwent a reversal operation was described. In 1976 the government of Indira Gandhi carried out a policy of involuntary sterilization. A total of 8.2 million sterilizations were performed during 1976-1977 and many of these were performed under coercion. Although this program was abandoned with the fall of the Gandhi government, it set back family planning in India by making the population suspicious of any government programs aimed at limiting family size. The year before the coercive program was instituted, 2.7 million sterilizations were performed, but in the year following the collapse of the program, only 0.9 million sterilizations were performed. Although Indira Gandhi recently returned to power, it is unlikely that compulsory sterilization policies will be reinstituted. Rukmini Prasad was one of the many women who was forced into accepting a tubal ligation in 1976. Her husband, who worked as a janitor in a government office building, was indirectly threatened with the loss of his job unless he or his wife agreed to accept sterilization. At the time of sterilization, Rukmini Prasad had just given birth to her 2nd son and had a total of 4 children. She was harshly criticised by her family and neighbors for submitting to the operation and to add to her anguish her new son died shortly after the sterilization. Recently she developed a hernia. Since she needed an operation to correct the problem, she decided to have a sterilization reversal performed at the same time. During the operation her doctor discovered that the tubes were cut at the optimum location for successful reversal. The patient was informed that she had a 40% chance of becoming pregnant again. She was pleased to receive this good news but more importantly, she felt that she once again had the respect of her neighbors and her family.	0
18210171	Micro-colinearity between rice, Brachypodium, and Triticum monococcum at the wheat domestication locus Q. Brachypodium, a wild temperate grass with a small genome, was recently proposed as a new model organism for the large-genome grasses. In this study, we evaluated gene content and microcolinearity between diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum), Brachypodium sylvaticum, and rice at a local genomic region harboring the major wheat domestication gene Q. Gene density was much lower in T. monococcum (one per 41 kb) because of gene duplication and an abundance of transposable elements within intergenic regions as compared to B. sylvaticum (one per 14 kb) and rice (one per 10 kb). For the Q gene region, microcolinearity was more conserved between wheat and rice than between wheat and Brachypodium because B. sylvaticum contained two genes apparently not present within the orthologous regions of T. monococcum and rice. However, phylogenetic analysis of Q and leukotriene A-4 hydrolase-like gene orthologs, which were colinear among the three species, showed that Brachypodium is more closely related to wheat than rice, which agrees with previous studies. We conclude that Brachypodium will be a useful tool for gene discovery, comparative genomics, and the study of evolutionary relationships among the grasses but will not preclude the need to conduct large-scale genomics experiments in the Triticeae.	0
18091359	Fetal onset of general movements. Perinatal qualitative assessment of general movements (GMs) is a tool to evaluate the integrity of the young nervous system. The aim of this investigation was to study the emergence of GMs. Fetal onset of GMs was studied sonographically in 18 fetuses during the first trimester of uncomplicated in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancies in weekly assessments. The earliest motility consisting of small and simple sideways bending (SB) of head and/or rump starts at 7 wk, lasting about 1 s. Between 7 and 8.5 wk, motility differentiates further into movements in which also one or two arms or legs become active; movements are still slow, small, and in one direction, but the duration increases to a few seconds. The transition into GMs at 9-10 wk is characterized by variation in participating body parts and amplitude, speed, and direction during longer periods of time. Between 9 and 13 wk, simple and stereotyped SBs and GMs may coexist. At 9 wk, the incidence of SBs decreases (p = 0.01) and that of GMs increases (p = 0.006). The data suggest that initial simple fetal motility is generated by spinal and brainstem circuitries, and the emergence of complex and variable GMs denotes the onset of supraspinal modulation of this spinal and brainstem activity.	0
14753825	Oxidation in nonclassical organolanthanide chemistry: synthesis, characterization, and X-ray crystal structures of cerium(III) and -(IV) amides. [Ce(NR(2))(3)] (R = SiMe(3)) with TeCl(4) in tetrahydrofuran solution gave a mixture of two major products in a combined yield of ca. 50% based on available metal: (i) the Ce(IV) amide [CeCl(NR(2))(3)] (1), which was isolated as purple needles and identified on the basis of (1)H NMR and mass spectra, microanalysis, and a single-crystal X-ray analysis [C(18)H(54)CeClN(3)Si(6), rhombohedral, R3c (No. 161), a = b = 18.4508(7) A, c = 16.8934(7) A, Z = 6]; (ii) unstable [[Ce(NR(2))(2)(mu-Cl)(thf)](2)] (2), as colorless blocks [C(32)H(88)Ce(2)Cl(2)N(4)O(2)Si(8), monoclinic, P2(1)/n (No. 14), a = 14.506(3) A, b = 13.065(3) A, c = 16.779(3) A, beta = 113.789(12) degrees, Z = 2], which readily disproportionated in solution. In toluene solution, the product 1 was obtained exclusively. The same cerium(III) amide starting material was oxidized by PBr(2)Ph(3) in diethyl ether solution to give purple [CeBr(NR(2))(3)] (3) [C(18)H(54)BrCeN(3)Si(6), rhombohedral, R3c (No. 161), a = b = 18.4113(12) A, c = 16.9631(17) A, Z = 6], along with presumed [CeBr(3)(OEt(2))(n)()], which has not been characterized but with thf, by displacement of the ether ligands, gave [CeBr(3)(thf)(4)] (4) [C(16)H(32)Br(3)CeO(4), triclinic, P1 (No. 2), a = 8.2536(7) A, b = 9.4157(5) A, c = 15.5935(14) A, alpha = 79.009(5), beta = 87.290(3) degrees, gamma = 74.835(5) degrees, Z = 2).

18303133	Memantine-induced myoclonus and delirium exacerbated by trimethoprim. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of myoclonus and delirium seen in a patient taking a combination of memantine and trimethoprim. CASE SUMMARY: A 78-year-old woman was admitted to the medical center in October 2007 with rapid deterioration of Alzheimer's dementia and progressive myoclonus. In 2003, donepezil 5 mg/day had been initiated and her disease slowly progressed. In 2006, memantine 10 mg twice daily was added. Myoclonic activity and delirium were noted in 2007 when a urinary tract infection (UTI) was treated with double-strength trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX 160 mg/800 mg). After discontinuation of TMP/SMX, the patient's condition returned to baseline level. Several weeks later, trimethoprim 100 mg daily was added for UTI prophylaxis. Within weeks, spontaneous generalized myoclonic activity resumed to the extent that the patient was unable to walk. She became increasingly delirious. A week before admission, levodopa/carbidopa 250 mg/100 mg was added for presumptive restless legs syndrome and the patient became extremely delirious and combative, requiring hospitalization. Because of the striking similarity of dose-related toxicities reported with amantadine, a slightly different aminoadamantane, memantine was withheld. Trimethoprim was discontinued due to a likely interaction with memantine. Donepezil and famotidine were withheld due to questions of therapeutic necessity. After 3 days, the myoclonus had completely resolved and the patient was no longer agitated or combative during the remainder of her hospitalization. She was cooperative and ambulatory and was discharged. DISCUSSION: Memantine is cleared primarily through the kidneys and should be renally dosed. Drugs that interfere with elimination-that is, other drugs utilizing the organic cation transporter-2 in the tubule, such as trimethoprim, metformin, or imipramine-may lead to drug accumulation. Our patient, who had impaired renal function, developed severe myoclonus and delirium after trimethoprim was added to therapy with memantine. As there were no reports of myoclonus and delirium with this drug combination and because of the structural, pharmacologic, and pharmacokinetic similarities between the aminoadamantanes memantine and amantadine, we researched similar dual adverse effects reported with amantadine. Amantadine has led to the same adverse effects noted in our patient, not only in patients with renal impairment, but also in one patient when trimethoprim was added to a stable dose of amantadine. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of a drug interaction between memantine and trimethoprim, which resulted in clinically significant myoclonus and delirium. Clinicians should be aware of this potential interaction, since there have been reports of this adverse effect with the use of amantadine. Because memantine chemically and pharmacologically resembles amantadine, it is quite possible that their toxicities are similar.	0

17657516	CCM3 interacts with CCM2 indicating common pathogenesis for cerebral cavernous malformations. Individuals carrying a mutation in one of the three cerebral cavernous malformation genes (CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2, CCM3) cannot be clinically distinguished, raising the possibility that they act within common molecular pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that CCM3 (PDCD10) coprecipitates and colocalizes with CCM2. We also show that CCM3 directly binds to serine/threonine kinase 25 (STK25, YSK1, SOK1) and the phosphatase domain of Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1, PTPN13, PTP-Bas, PTP-BL). CCM3 is phosphorylated by STK25 but not by its other Yeast-Two hybrid interactor STK24, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain of FAP-1 dephosphorylates CCM3. Finally, our experiments reveal that STK25 forms a protein complex with CCM2. Thus, our data link two proteins of unknown function, CCM3 and STK25, with CCM2, which is part of signaling pathways essential for vascular development and CCM pathogenesis.	0

15288562	An examination of the characteristics and traffic risks of drivers suspended/revoked for different reasons. PROBLEM: Prior research has demonstrated that suspended/revoked drivers pose a significant traffic risk, but until now little has been known about whether, and if so how, this risk varies as a function of the reason for suspension/revocation. METHOD: This study classifies suspended/revoked drivers into subgroups based on their reason for suspension/revocation, and then develops demographic and driving record profiles for each group. Separate driving record profiles are developed for the following traffic safety indicators, measured 3 years prior to the suspension/revocation action: (a) total crashes, (b) fatal/injury crashes, (c) total traffic convictions, and (d) total incidents (crashes + convictions). RESULTS: The findings clearly show that: (a) suspended/revoked drivers are a heterogeneous group, both demographically and in their driving behavior; (b) some suspended drivers, such as those suspended/revoked for a non-driving offense, have low traffic risks that are not much higher than those of validly-licensed drivers, and; (c) all suspended groups have elevated crash and conviction rates, compared to validly-licensed drivers. DISCUSSION: The implications of these findings for current laws and policies targeting suspended/revoked drivers are discussed, and recommendations for improving these laws/policies are presented. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: None.	0
22879838	Minimally invasive surgical treatment of malignant pleural effusions. INTRODUCTION: Usually the pleural cavity contains a small amount of liquid (approximately 10 ml). Pleural effusions appear when the liquid production rate overpasses the absorption rate with a greater amount of liquid inside the pleural cavity. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between January 1998 to December 2008 we conducted a study in order to establish the adequate surgical treatment for MPEs. Effective control of a recurrent malignant pleural effusion can greatly improve the quality of life of the cancer patient. The present review collects and examines the clinical results of minimally invasive techniques designed to treat this problem. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Patients with MPEs were studied according to several criteria. In our study we observed the superiority of intraoperative talc poudrage, probably due to a more uniform distribution of talc particles over the pleural surface. Minimal pleurotomy with thoracic drainage and instillation of a talc suspension is also a safe and effective technique and should be employed when there are contraindications for the thoracoscopic minimally invasive procedure. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of comparisons involving effectiveness, morbidity, and convenience, we recommend the thoracoscopic insufflations of talc as a fine powder with pleural drainage as the procedure of choice.	0
22899640	Rapid determination of alkylphenols in aqueous samples by in situ acetylation and microwave-assisted headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A rapid and solvent-free procedure for the determination of 4-tert-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol isomers in aqueous samples is described. The method involves in-situ acetylation and microwave-assisted headspace solid-phase microextraction prior to their determination using gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry operated in the selected ion storage mode. The dual experimental protocols to evaluate the effects of various derivatization and extraction parameters were investigated and the conditions optimized. Under optimized conditions, 300  L of acetic anhydride mixed with 1 g of potassium hydrogencarbonate and 2 g of sodium chloride in a 20 mL aqueous sample were efficiently extracted by a 65  m polydimethylsiloxane-divinylbenzene fiber that was located in the headspace when the system was microwave irradiated at 80 W for 5 min. The limits of quantitation were 5 and 50 ng/L for 4-tert-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol isomers, respectively. The precision for these analytes, as indicated by relative standard deviations, were less than 8% for both intra- and inter-day analysis. Accuracy, expressed as the mean extraction recovery, was between 74 to 88%. A standard addition method was used to quantitate 4-tert-octylphenol and 4-nonylphenol isomers, and the concentrations ranged from 120 to 930 ng/L in various environmental water samples.	0

10447795	Persistent effects of maternal deprivation on HPA regulation can be reversed by feeding and stroking, but not by dexamethasone. Maternal deprivation of neonatal rats for 24 h has immediate and persistent effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) regulation. Immediately after deprivation corticosterone (CORT) is elevated. The primary purpose of our experiments was to determine if, by preventing this CORT elevation, the persistent effects could be reversed. In experiment 1, pups were injected with dexamethasone at the onset of the 24-h deprivation period on postnatal day 11 to suppress the rise in CORT. In experiment 2 some aspects of maternal behaviour known to suppress CORT levels were mimicked during deprivation from postnatal days 11-12. The pups were either: (1) left undisturbed; (2) stroked periodically; or (3) stroked and episodically fed. At postnatal day 20 basal and stress-induced adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and CORT levels were measured as well as brain mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR). Neonatal rats receiving dexamethasone prior to the onset of the deprivation on day 11 did not differ on day 20 from deprived pups that were exposed to elevated CORT levels. There were no detectable changes in the non-deprived pups that were treated with dexamethasone. In contrast, feeding and stroking during the period of deprivation obliterated the persistent effects both with regard to the reduced ACTH response and the decreased GR mRNA in hippocampus and hypothalamus. Stroking alone appears to have no influence. In conclusion, the persistent reduction of the ACTH response to mild stress and the decrease of GR mRNA is not mediated by deprivation-induced elevations in CORT, but appears to be reversible by reinstating specific aspects of the dam's nurturing behaviour.	0
7371040	Age-dependent cell inactivation by vincristine alone or in combination with 1-propargyl-5-chloropyrimidin-2-one. Inactivating effects caused by vincristine alone or in combination with another mitotic inhibitor, 1-propargyl-5-chloropyrimidin-2-one, were studied as loss of colony-forming ability in exponentially growing or synchronized populations of the human cell line NHIK 3025. Treatment with 4 ng vincristine per ml(4.3 nM) in G2 led to irreversible mitotic arrest. Both mitotic arrest and lethal damage due to vincristine were primarily induced when cells were exposed in late S and G2, suggesting a correlation between the cell cycle-inhibitory and inactivating effect of this drug at clinically relevant concentrations. No repair of sublethal damage after vincristine treatment could be detected within 5 hr. A common feature in the age response of NHIK 3025 cells to the two mitotic inhibitors is drug resistance in G1. However, while mitosis is the most sensitive stage in the cycle with respect to inactivation by 1-propargyl-5-chloropyrimidin-2-one, mitotic cells are relatively resistant to treatment with vincristine. The combined inactivating effect of vincristine and 1-propargyl-5-chloropyrimidin-2-one was purely additive during interphase. In mitosis, the two drugs demonstrated a striking synergistic effect.	0
21036454	Dispatcher-assisted telephone cardiopulmonary resuscitation using a French-language compression-only protocol in volunteers with or without prior life support training: A randomized trial. OBJECTIVES: Due to the recent interest in hands-only protocols for dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the lack of any validated algorithms in French, our primary objective was to evaluate a new French-language protocol in terms of its efficacy to help previously untrained volunteers in performing basic life support efforts of appropriate quality, and secondarily to investigate its potential utility in subjects with previous training. METHODS: Untrained volunteers were recruited among adults in a public movie centre and previously trained volunteers among undergraduate nursing students. Participants were randomly assigned to 'phone CPR' versus 'no phone CPR' by drawing sets of envelopes. Primary outcome measures were the results of the Cardiff evaluation test; the secondary measures were global scoring of a complete 5min period of CPR, in a manikin model of cardiac arrest. RESULTS: Out of 146 volunteers assessed for eligibility, 36 previously untrained candidates declined participation. 110 participants, distributed into four groups, completed the study: the previously untrained non-guided group (group A, n=30), the previously untrained guided group (group B, n=30), the previously trained non-guided group (group C, n=25) and the previously trained guided group (group D, n=25). Results of the Cardiff test and global evaluation of CPR performance revealed a significant improvement in group B as compared with group A, approaching the level of the group C. Previously trained guided bystanders had the best CPR scores, notably because of an improvement in the quality of airway management. CONCLUSION: When used by dispatchers, this new French-language algorithm offers the opportunity to help previously untrained bystanders initiate CPR. The same protocol may serve to guide volunteers with prior basic life support training to reach their best CPR performance.	0
23805131	Microbial communities associated with ferromanganese nodules and the surrounding sediments. The formation and maintenance of deep-sea ferromanganese/polymetallic nodules still remains a mystery 140 years after their discovery. The wealth of rare metals concentrated in these nodules has spurred global interest in exploring the mining potential of these resources. The prevailing theory of abiotic formation has been called into question and the role of microbial metabolisms in nodule development is now an area of active research. To understand the community structure of microbes associated with nodules and their surrounding sediment, we performed targeted sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene from three nodules collected from the central South Pacific. Results have shown that the microbial communities of the nodules are significantly distinct from the communities in the surrounding sediments, and that the interiors of the nodules harbor communities different from the exterior. This suggests not only differences in potential metabolisms between the nodule and sediment communities, but also differences in the dominant metabolisms of interior and exterior communities. We identified several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) unique to both the nodule and sediment environments. The identified OTUs were assigned putative taxonomic identifications, including two OTUs only found associated with the nodules, which were assigned to the a-Proteobacteria. Finally, we explored the diversity of the most assigned taxonomic group, the Thaumarchaea MG-1, which revealed novel OTUs compared to previous research from the region and suggests a potential role as a source of fixed carbon for ammonia oxidizing archaea in the environment.	0

15470297	Prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in a heart failure program. Recent data show that a high percentage of patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), contributing to the incidence of morbidity and mortality in heart failure. This study examines the prevalence of sleep disorders in stable heart failure patients regardless of ejection fraction. On three consecutive days in a heart failure clinic, all patients were asked to participate in a screening for SDB. This screening involved the placement of an outpatient device (ClearPath, Nexan, Inc., Alpharetta, GA), which collects thoracic impedance, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and 2-lead electrocardiogram data. Sixteen patients (42%) had moderate or severe SDB, and 22 patients (55%) had mild or no significant SDB. Fourteen of the 16 patients with moderate or severe SDB subsequently received treatment by confirming SDB and the continuous positive airway pressure in a sleep lab. Forty-two percent of patients with stable heart failure presenting to a heart failure clinic screened positive for SDB, despite receiving optimal standard of care.	0
23412879	Indirect determination of pediatric blood count reference intervals. BACKGROUND: Determination of pediatric reference intervals (RIs) for laboratory quantities, including hematological quantities, is complex. The measured quantities vary by age, and obtaining samples from healthy children is difficult. Many widely used RIs are derived from small sample numbers and are split into arbitrary discrete age intervals. Use of intra-laboratory RIs specific to the examined population and analytical device used is not yet fully established. Indirect methods address these issues by deriving RIs from clinical laboratory databases which contain large datasets of both healthy and pathological samples. METHODS: A refined indirect approach was used to create continuous age-dependent RIs for blood count quantities and sodium from birth to adulthood. The dataset for each quantity consisted of 60,000 individual samples from our clinical laboratory. Patient samples were separated according to age, and a density function of the proportion of healthy samples was estimated for each age group. The resulting RIs were merged to obtain continuous RIs from birth to adulthood. RESULTS: The obtained RIs were compared to RIs generated by identical laboratory instruments, and to population-specific RIs created using conventional methods. This comparison showed a high concordance of reference limits and their age-dependent dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: The indirect approach reported here is well-suited to create continuous, intra-laboratory RIs from clinical laboratory databases and showed that the RIs generated are comparable to those created using established methods. The procedure can be transferred to other laboratory quantities and can be used as an alternative method for RI determination where conventional approaches are limited.	0
11225473	Pamidronate and calcitonin as therapy of acute cancer-related hypercalcemia in children. Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia is a rare event in children with malignancies. Up to now there is limited experience treating childhood hypercalcemia with bisphosphonates in addition to calcitonin. We report a 5-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic lymphoma who presented with malignant hypercalcemia at diagnosis. The maximal serum calcium concentration was 15.2 mg/dl (3.81 mmol/l). Conventional therapy with forced diuresis and furosemide failed. Calcitonin (10 IU/kg/24 h i.v. for 2 days) and pamidronate (1 mg/kg over 2 hours i.v.) were used successfully without adverse effect lowering the serum calcium level within 24 hours to normal values. We recommend the use of calcitonin and pamidronate as first-line therapy together with forced diuresis and furosemide in childhood hypercalcemia secondary to malignancies as it is rapidly effective and has no significant side effects.	0

10723141	Identification of Mad as a repressor of the human telomerase (hTERT) gene. Activation of telomerase, which has been frequently associated with cellular immortality, may constitute a key step in the development of human cancer. De-repression in the expression of its catalytic subunit hTERT gene has been proposed to directly link to the telomerase activation in tumor cells. Little is known about the mechanism how the hTERT gene is repressed in telomerase-negative mortal cells. This study was conducted, using an expression cloning approach, with the aim of identifying the gene(s) responsible for repressing the hTERT gene expression. Using this genetic screen, we isolated the transcription factor Mad as a repressor. Mutation of its DNA binding sites caused significant de-repression of hTERT promoter activity in mortal cells. This Mad-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter in mortal cells was counteracted by ectopic expression of Myc. The antagonism between Mad and Myc was also observed with an endogenous hTERT promoter. Their potential roles in differential hTERT promoter activities were further supported by the relative amounts of Mad and Myc proteins detected in immortal and mortal cells. Thus, Mad may be a direct negative regulator of hTERT in mortal cells and this repression mechanism can be inhibited by induction of Myc in immortal cells.	1
20211971	Thyroid hormone-regulated mouse cerebral cortex genes are differentially dependent on the source of the hormone: a study in monocarboxylate transporter-8- and deiodinase-2-deficient mice. Thyroid hormones influence brain development through the control of gene expression. The concentration of the active hormone T(3) in the brain depends on T(3) transport through the blood-brain barrier, mediated in part by the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (Mct8/MCT8) and the activity of type 2 deiodinase (D2) generating T(3) from T(4). The relative roles of each of these pathways in the regulation of brain gene expression is not known. To shed light on this question, we analyzed thyroid hormone-dependent gene expression in the cerebral cortex of mice with inactivated Mct8 (Slc16a2) and Dio2 genes, alone or in combination. We used 34 target genes identified to be controlled by thyroid hormone in microarray comparisons of cerebral cortex from wild-type control and hypothyroid mice on postnatal d 21. Inactivation of the Mct8 gene (Mct8KO) was without effect on the expression of 31 of these genes. Normal gene expression in the absence of the transporter was mostly due to D2 activity because the combined disruption of Mct8 and Dio2 led to similar effects as hypothyroidism on the expression of 24 genes. Dio2 disruption alone did not affect the expression of positively regulated genes, but, as in hypothyroidism, it increased that of negatively regulated genes. We conclude that gene expression in the Mct8KO cerebral cortex is compensated in part by D2-dependent mechanisms. Intriguingly, positive or negative regulation of genes by thyroid hormone is sensitive to the source of T(3) because Dio2 inactivation selectively affects the expression of negatively regulated genes.	0

12435194	Treatment of atrial fibrillation by catheter ablation of conduction gaps in the crista terminalis and cavotricuspid isthmus of the right atrium. A 74-year-old man with atrial fibrillation (AF) underwent electrophysiologic study and catheter ablation with a noncontact mapping system. AF was induced by coronary sinus pacing, and noncontact mapping showed ever-changing movement of multiple wavefronts with one dominant reentrant circuit around the tricuspid annulus, splitting wavefront conduction through the gaps in the crista terminalis, and then fusion and stasis of wavefronts. After creation of bidirectional conduction block over crista terminalis gaps and the cavotricuspid isthmus, AF or atrial flutter was noninducible. No further AF recurrence was noted during 6-month follow-up.	0
7572907	Serum cryoglobulin and chronic hepatitis C virus disease among Japanese patients. OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated mixed cryoglobulins appear to be detected often in hepatitis C-related chronic liver disease. The association of the two phenomenon among Japanese patients is the subject of the present study. METHODS: Serum levels of total hemolytic complement (CH50) and anti-C3d-binding immune complex, as well as the prevalence of cryoglobulins, were studied in 213 patients with chronic liver disease (hepatitis C, 155; hepatitis B, 58). Cryoprecipitates were tested for anti-HCV Ab and HCV RNA. RESULTS: CH50 activity was significantly lower in patients with hepatitis C than in those with hepatitis B except in responders to interferon who showed a sustained loss of HCV RNA. Cryoglobulins were detected in 24 (37%) of 65 patients with hepatitis C; they generally consisted of polyclonal immunoglobulins but one case. Cryoglobulins were more frequently observed in cirrhotic patients and in those with a longer duration of disease. Cryoglobulinemia-related clinical signs such as vasculitis occurred in only three cases. Patients with cryoglobulins had lower CH50 activity and higher immune complex values than those without cryoglobulins. Anti-HCV Ab and HCV RNA were detected in all cryoprecipitates tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that HCV is a major cause of cryoglobulins and advanced liver damage. However, serum cryoglobulins with polyclonal immunoglobulins appear to be less frequent among Japanese patients than among those studied in Western countries.	0
12973447	Tissue factor pathway inhibitors as a novel approach to antithrombotic therapy. Tissue factor is the initiator of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. It is expressed by endothelial cells when stimulated by cytokines and other mediators. The effect of tissue factor is physiologically balanced by tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Atherosclerotic plaques are rich in tissue factor. It stimulates thrombus formation when plaques rupture. The emerging role of tissue factor in cellular signaling and in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has directed attention to inhibitors of tissue factor as a new antithrombotic approach. In comparison to currently used anticoagulants, tissue factor pathway inhibitors have the potential advantage of inhibiting the coagulation cascade at its earliest stage. These agents also act locally at the site of endothelial injury with minimal disturbance of systemic hemostasis. In addition, their inhibitory effect on neointimal formation and restenosis after vascular intervention are appealing features in the management of the complications of atherosclerosis.	0

Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS, also known as Ondine's Curse) is a rare syndrome characterized by apnea, cyanosis, and hypotonia. A 4-year-old, 90-cm, 12-kg girl with CCHS, mental retardation (MR), and Hischsprung's disease (HD) was treated under general anesthesia. Intravenous drugs were not used, but sevoflurane, a volatile anesthetic, was used. As a result, the recovery time from the end of the operation to returning to the ward was very short, only 18 minutes. There was no trouble during the perioperative period. We safely performed general anesthesia and dental treatment for a girl who had CCHS with HD and MR.	0

METHODS: The authors' experience and review of the literature form the basis for the proposed classification. RESULTS: Five types of folds and striae are described: loose epithelium, hinge ridge, hinge fold, deep stromal striae, deep epithelial/Bowman's striae. CONCLUSION: Linear striae in laser in situ keratomileusis flaps have a variety of appearances and different postoperative courses that require accurate diagnosis and management.	0
7970747	Variation of the visual acuity--luminance function with background colour. The relationship between visual acuity (VA) and background colour is a question that still creates a certain amount of confusion even today, although most authors agree that colour background does not basically affect VA, or at best, values that are only slightly better are obtained with monochromatic yellow light. The object of this paper is to try to clarify if, when the axial chromatic aberration (ACA) has been compensated for, certain differences due exclusively to colour persist or not. In order for this, the VA-luminance functions with red, green, blue and white backgrounds have been measured for two emmetropic observers, before and after compensating for the ACA. The results show that after the compensation, the curve corresponding to red is above the one corresponding to blue, with the one corresponding to green in between. The achromatic function (white background) practically overlaps with the green one. This behaviour is consistent with that shown recently for contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs). However, the asymptotic values are identical for the three colours, and so, it is understandable that no significant differences are normally found when only a standard measurement of VA is taken using the typical illumination from an optotype projector.	0

9065434	Constitutive binding of the transcription factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) enhancer binding factor to the IL-2 promoter. A positive regulatory element in the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter, designated the antigen receptor response element-2, is essential for the induction of IL-2 gene expression upon the binding of an inducible multiprotein complex of proteins known as nuclear factor of activated T cells. In the current study, we demonstrated that the winged-helix transcription factor IL-2 enhancer binding factor (ILF) is constitutively expressed in both resting and activated Jurkat cells and binds to two adjacent sequence motifs immediately downstream of the binding site for NFAT. One of these elements has a high degree of homology with consensus binding sites for a variety of winged-helix DNA binding proteins, and the second site functions to modulate ILF binding. Mutagenesis of each of the two sequence elements required for ILF binding decreased IL-2 promoter activity when assayed in transfection assays. Although ILF bound constitutively to the IL-2 promoter, it was not detected as a component of the NFAT complex. These results suggest that important regulatory sequences in the IL-2 promoter are bound by ILF and that this binding may be involved in the control of IL-2 gene expression.	1

24342640	Role of Acinetobacter baumannii UmuD homologs in antibiotic resistance acquired through DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. The role of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 UmuDC homologs A1S_0636-A1S_0637, A1S_1174-A1S_1173, and A1S_1389 (UmuDAb) in antibiotic resistance acquired through UV-induced mutagenesis was evaluated. Neither the growth rate nor the UV-related survival of any of the three mutants was significantly different from that of the wild-type parental strain. However, all mutants, and especially the umuDAb mutant, were less able to acquire resistance to rifampin and streptomycin through the activities of their error-prone DNA polymerases. Furthermore, in the A. baumannii mutant defective in the umuDAb gene, the spectrum of mutations included a dramatic reduction in the frequency of transition mutations, the mutagenic signature of the DNA polymerase V encoded by umuDC.	0

11164266	P450 in biotechnology: zinc driven omega-hydroxylation of p-nitrophenoxydodecanoic acid using P450 BM-3 F87A as a catalyst. Cytochrome P450 enzymes require the delivery of two electrons to the heme protein for their enzymatic function. NADPH or NADH are usually used as reduction equivalents. In the absence of a substrate, NADPH may inactivate P450 enzymes. Furthermore, it is expensive, making it unsuitable for the preparative synthesis of fine chemicals. Approaches for replacing NADPH with an electrochemically generated reduction by using platinum-electrodes and different mediators are known. In the present study, NADPH was substituted by the mediator cobalt(III)sepulchrate and zinc dust that serves as an electron source. The mutated fatty acid hydroxylase P450 BM-3 F87A from Bacillus megaterium was chosen as a catalyst, since it shows a three-fold higher sensitivity and a nearly five-fold higher activity for p-nitrophenoxydodecanoic acid (12-pNCA) than the wild-type enzyme. The formation of p-nitrophenolate can easily be monitored using a photometer at 410 nm. The turnover rate of the zinc/cobalt(III)sepulchrate system reaches 20% of the NADPH activity. Compared to the electrochemical approaches the activity is at least 77% higher (turnover 125 eq min-1). The presented alternative cofactor system can be used instead of NADPH or expensive electrochemical devices (platinum electrodes) for fine chemical synthesis.	0
23963546	Valsartan/amlodipine compared to nifedipine GITS in patients with hypertension inadequately controlled by monotherapy. INTRODUCTION: Current hypertension guidelines recommend single-pill combinations because they not only improve convenience and compliance to therapy and thus blood pressure (BP) control, but also reduce health-care costs. This study compared the efficacy and safety of valsartan/amlodipine single-pill combination with nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) in Chinese patients with hypertension who were inadequately controlled with monotherapy. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group study, 564 patients with hypertension not adequately controlled by prior monotherapy were randomized to receive valsartan/amlodipine 80/5  mg or nifedipine GITS 30  mg once daily for 12  weeks. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis (n  =  540), valsartan/amlodipine (n  =  272) showed a least-square mean reduction of -16.6 versus -10.8  mmHg by nifedipine GITS (n  =  268; mean between-treatment difference: -5.8  mmHg; P  <  0.0001) from baseline to week 12. The corresponding results for mean sitting diastolic BP were -8.6 and -4.6  mmHg, respectively (difference: -4.0  mmHg; P  <  0.0001). The percentage of patients achieving the BP target (<140/90 or <130/80  mmHg in the absence or presence of diabetes mellitus, respectively) was significantly higher with valsartan/amlodipine (79.0%) versus nifedipine GITS (57.4%; P  <  0.0001). The overall incidence rate of adverse events was lower with valsartan/amlodipine (19.2%) than with nifedipine GITS (29.4%; P  =  0.004). CONCLUSION: The valsartan/amlodipine 80/5  mg single-pill combination is well tolerated and more effective than nifedipine GITS 30  mg for BP control in Chinese patients with hypertension.	0
9574707	Presence of multiple \"Helicobacter heilmannii\" strains in an individual suffering from ulcers and in his two cats. Circumstantial evidence suggests that \"Helicobacter heilmannii\" infection is an example of zoonosis. The presence of \"H. heilmannii\" strains in a human subject with acute gastric erosions, in his two cats, and in two unrelated cats was analyzed, and the genetic relatedness of the human and feline strains was assessed. A 580-bp, PCR-amplified sequence of \"H. heilmannii\" urease B gene (ureB) obtained from biopsies from the human subject and his two cats was restricted with AluI and cloned for sequencing. Analysis of the restriction fragment length polymorphism of the ureB-amplified product suggested the presence of different individual \"H. heilmannii\" strains in the cats and of three distinct strains in the human subject. One of the \"H. heilmannii\" ureB sequences amplified from the human subject's biopsies was identical to that derived from one of his cats. The degree of similarity between the other \"H. heilmannii\" human and feline nucleotide sequences was higher than 97%. Most of the base substitutions were conservative. We conclude that human and animal \"H. heilmannii\" strains are closely related and that humans can be infected by more than one \"H. heilmannii\" strain, as has been observed for Helicobacter pylori.	0

15600757	Flow profiling of a surface-acoustic-wave nanopump. The flow profile in a capillary gap and the pumping efficiency of an acoustic micropump employing surface acoustic waves is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Ultrasonic surface waves on a piezoelectric substrate strongly couple to a thin liquid layer and generate a quadrupolar streaming pattern within the fluid. We use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy as complementary tools to investigate the resulting flow profile. The velocity was found to depend on the applied power approximately linearly and to decrease with the inverse third power of the distance from the ultrasound generator on the chip. The found properties reveal acoustic streaming as a promising tool for the controlled agitation during microarray hybridization.	0

19171851	Fluid retention is associated with cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (stage 5) who undergo hemodialysis treatment have similarities to heart failure patients in that both populations retain fluid frequently and have excessively high mortality. Volume overload in heart failure is associated with worse outcomes. We hypothesized that in hemodialysis patients, greater interdialytic fluid gain is associated with poor all-cause and cardiovascular survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 2-year (July 2001 to June 2003) mortality in 34,107 hemodialysis patients across the United States who had an average weight gain of at least 0.5 kg above their end-dialysis dry weight by the time the subsequent hemodialysis treatment started. The 3-month averaged interdialytic weight gain was divided into 8 categories of 0.5-kg increments (up to > or =4.0 kg). Eighty-six percent of patients gained >1.5 kg between 2 dialysis sessions. In unadjusted analyses, higher weight gain was associated with better nutritional status (higher protein intake, serum albumin, and body mass index) and tended to be linked to greater survival. However, after multivariate adjustment for demographics (case mix) and surrogates of malnutrition-inflammation complex, higher weight-gain increments were associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of cardiovascular death for weight gain <1.0 kg and > or =4.0 kg (compared with 1.5 to 2.0 kg as the reference) were 0.67 (0.58 to 0.76) and 1.25 (1.12 to 1.39), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In hemodialysis patients, greater fluid retention between 2 subsequent hemodialysis treatment sessions is associated with higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death. The mechanisms by which fluid retention influences cardiovascular survival in hemodialysis may be similar to those in patients with heart failure and warrant further research.	0
20919825	Metabolomics and detection of colorectal cancer in humans: a systematic review. Metabolomics represents one of the new omics sciences and capitalizes on the unique presence and concentration of small molecules in tissues and body fluids to construct a 'fingerprint' that can be unique to the individual and, within that individual, unique to environmental influences, including health and disease states. As such, metabolomics has the potential to serve an important role in diagnosis and management of human conditions. Colorectal cancer is a major public health concern. Current population-based screening methods are suboptimal and whether metabolomics could represent a new tool of screening is under investigation. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize existing literature on metabolomics and colorectal cancer, in terms of diagnostic accuracies and distinguishing metabolites. Eight studies are included. A total of 12 metabolites (taurine, lactate, choline, inositol, glycine, phosphocholine, proline, phenylalanine, alanine, threonine, valine and leucine) were found to be more prevalent in colorectal cancer and glucose was found to be in higher proportion in control specimens using tissue metabolomics. Serum and urine metabolomics identified several other differential metabolites between controls and colorectal cancer patients. This article highlights the novelty of the field of metabolomics in colorectal oncology.	0
22264176	Delayed onset of paralysis and slowed tumor growth following in situ placement of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 within spine tumors in a rat model of metastatic breast cancer. OBJECT: Recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins (rhBMPs) are FDA-approved for specific spinal fusion procedures, but their use is contraindicated in spine tumor resection beds because of an unclear interaction between tumor tissue and such growth factors. Interestingly, a number of studies have suggested that BMPs may slow the growth of adenocarcinomas in vitro, and these lesions represent the majority of bony spine tumors. In this study, the authors hypothesized that rhBMP-2 placed in an intraosseous spine tumor in the rat could suppress tumor and delay the onset of paresis in such animals. METHODS: Twenty-six female nude athymic rats were randomized into an experimental group (Group 1) or a positive control group (Group 2). Group 1 (tumor + 15  g rhBMP-2 sponge, 13 rats) underwent transperitoneal exposure and implantation of breast adenocarcinoma (CRL-1666) into the L-6 spine segment, followed by the implantation of a bovine collagen sponge impregnated with 15  g of rhBMP-2. Group 2 (tumor + 0.9% NaCl sponge, 13 rats) underwent transperitoneal exposure and tumor implantation in the lumbar spine but no local treatment with rhBMP-2. An additional 8 animals were randomized into 2 negative control groups (Groups 3 and 4). Group 3 (15  g rhBMP-2 sponge, 4 rats) and Group 4 (0.9% NaCl sponge, 4 rats) underwent transperitoneal exposure of the lumbar spine along with the implantation of rhBMP-2- and saline-impregnated bovine collagen sponges, respectively. Neither of the negative control groups was implanted with tumor. The Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale was used to monitor daily motor function regression and the time to paresis (BBB score  <= 7). RESULTS: In comparison with the positive control animals (Group 2), the experimental animals (Group 1) had statistically significant longer mean (25.8    12.2 vs 13    1.4 days, p  <= 0.001) and median (20 vs 13 days) times to paresis. In addition, the median survival time was significantly longer in the experimental animals (20 vs 13.5 days, p  <= 0.0001). Histopathological analysis demonstrated bone growth and tumor inhibition in the experimental animals, whereas bone destruction and cord compression were observed in the positive control animals. Neither of the negative control groups (Groups 3 and 4) demonstrated any evidence of neurological deterioration, morbidity, or cord compromise on either gross or histological analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the local administration of rhBMP-2 (15  g, 10  l of 1.5-mg/ml solution) in a rat spine tumor model of breast cancer not only fails to stimulate local tumor growth, but also decreases local tumor growth and delays the onset of paresis in rats. This preclinical experiment is the first to show that the local placement of rhBMP-2 in a spine tumor bed may slow tumor progression and delay associated neurological decline.	0
19360486	Epigenetic maternal effects on endogenous rhythms in precocial birds. Development involves interactions between genetic and environmental influences. Vertebrate mothers are generally the first individuals to encounter and interact with young animals. Thus, their role is primordial during ontogeny. The present study evaluated non-genomic effects of mothers on the development of rhythms of precocial Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica). First, we investigated the influence of mothering on the ontogeny of endogenous rhythms of young. We compared circadian and ultradian rhythms of feeding activity of quail reared with or without adoptive mothers. More brooded than non-brooded quail presented a circadian and/or an ultradian rhythm. Thus, the presence of the mother during the normal brooding period favors, in the long term, expression of rhythms in the young. Second, we investigated the influence of rhythmic phenotype of the mother on the development of endogenous rhythms of young by comparing quail brooded by circadian-rhythmic adoptive mothers (R) to quail brooded by circadian-arrhythmic adoptive mothers (A). More R-brooded than A-brooded quail expressed circadian rhythmicity, and circadian rhythm clarities were greater in R-brooded than A-brooded quail. Ultradian rhythmicity did not differ between R- and A-brooded quail, nor between R and A adoptive mothers. Thus, the rhythmic phenotypes of quail mothers influence the rhythmic phenotypes of their young. Our results demonstrate that mothers of precocial birds influence epigenetically the ontogeny of endogenous rhythms of the young they raise.	0

10406461	A role for the mitogen-activated protein kinase in mediating the ability of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to stimulate the prolactin promoter. The hypothalamic hormone, TRH, stimulates PRL secretion and gene transcription. We have examined the possibility that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) may play a role in mediating TRH effects on the PRL gene. TRH was found to stimulate sustained activation of MAPK in PRL-producing, GH3 cells, consistent with a possible role in transcriptional regulation. A kinase-defective, interfering MAPK kinase (MAPKK) mutant reduced TRH induction of the PRL promoter. Treatment with the MAPKK inhibitor, PD98059, blocked TRH-induced activation of MAPK and also reduced TRH induction of a PRL-luciferase reporter gene, confirming that MAPK activation is necessary for TRH effects on PRL gene expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that the PRL promoter contains binding sites for members of the Ets family of transcription factors, which are important for mediating MAPK responsiveness of the PRL promoter. Mutation of specific Ets sites within the PRL promoter reduced responsiveness to both TRH and MAPK. The finding that DNA elements required for MAPK responsiveness of the PRL gene colocalize with DNA elements required for TRH responsiveness further supports a role for MAPK in mediating TRH effects on the PRL gene. We also explored the signaling mechanisms that link the TRH receptor to MAPK induction. Occupancy of the TRH receptor results in activation of protein kinase C (PKC) as well as increases in the concentration of Ca2+ due to release from intracellular stores and entry of Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels. A PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, and an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nimodipine, both partially reduced TRH-induced MAPK activation and PRL promoter activity. The effects of the two inhibitors were additive. These studies are consistent with a signaling pathway involving PKC- and Ca2+-dependent activation of MAPK, which leads to phosphorylation of an Ets transcription factor and activation of the PRL promoter.	0

6807831	Membrane stimulation and intracellular killing by monocytes. The present paper reviews our recent studies concerning the intracellular killing of bacteria by human monocytes and compares the results with those found for circulating granulocytes. The findings show that optimal intracellular killing of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria is only reached during interaction of the Fc part of IgG and complement component C3b with their specific receptors in the membrane of the phagocytes. Similar stimulation was found during interaction of plant lectins and their specific sugar moieties in the cell membrane. The studies permit the general conclusion that optimal intracellular killing of micro-organisms requires membrane stimulation, which occurs after triggering of certain receptors.	0
23623312	Finite element modeling mesh quality, energy balance and validation methods: a review with recommendations associated with the modeling of bone tissue. The use of finite element models as research tools in biomechanics and orthopedics has grown exponentially over the last 20 years. However, the attention to mesh quality, model validation and appropriate energy balance methods and the reporting of these metrics has not kept pace with the general use of finite element modeling. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to summarize the current state of finite element modeling validation practices from the literature in biomechanics and orthopedics and to present specific methods and criteria limits that can be used as guidelines to assess mesh quality, validate simulation results and address energy balance issues. Of the finite element models reviewed from the literature, approximately 42% of them were not adequately validated, while 95% and 98% of the models did not assess the quality of the mesh or energy balance, respectively. A review of the methods that can be used to assess the quality of a mesh (e.g., aspect ratios, angle idealization and element Jacobians), measure the balance of energies (e.g., hour glass energy and mass scaling), and quantify the accuracy of the simulations (e.g., validation metrics, corridors, statistical techniques) are presented.	0

7922879	[The development of a research program based on a conceptual model for the discipline of nursing]. The purpose of this article was to illustrate the development of a team's research program based on a conceptual model for the nursing discipline: Roy's Adaptation Model. The ongoing research program includes studies of psychosocial factors, theoretically known for their potential for explaining health. Four groups of people are the focus of these studies: aged spouses in the community, family caregivers of ill elderly people, family caregivers of mentally ill people, and nurses as professional caregivers for elderly people in institutions. The studies are articulated using the three-level structure proposed by Fawcett _ Downs (1986) and Fawcett (1991): conceptual-theoretical-empirical. This research program aims to renew understanding of the person's adaptation processes to various environmental stimuli, adaptive responses that influence health, and nursing interventions that promote health (i.e., biopsychosocial integrity). In order to specify the research variables and relations to be studied between these variables in the first phase of the program, each research project is also guided by a middle-range theory compatible with Roy's Adaptation Model. Elaborated within related disciplines, these theories are variations of the Stress and Coping theory of Lazarus _ Folkman (1984). The results of these studies will be compared and articulated in a model that integrates the patterns of relations between the variables. The resulting empirical model together with Roy's conceptual model will be used to guide the development of nursing interventions intended to promote adaptive responses and biopsychosocial integrity. The second phase of the research program includes the implementation and evaluation of nursing strategies that promote adaptation among the four groups of people. This research program is a nursing contribution to certain social issues recognized as priorities by the governments of Canada and Qu  bec. This article is an illustration of one of the various ways of developing nursing knowledge.	0
11738524	Protective effect of vitamin E against mercuric chloride reproductive toxicity in male mice. Mercury intoxication has been associated with male reproductive toxicity in experimental animals and mercury may have the potential to produce adverse effects on fertility in men. Vitamin E may protect against toxic effects of mercury in the liver and other tissues. To investigate the protective role of vitamin E against mercuric chloride toxicity for the testis, epididymis, and vas deferens of adult male mice, animals were treated with either mercuric chloride 1.25 mg/kg/day, vitamin E 2 mg/kg/kg, or a combination of the two treatments. Control animals were treated with water. Treatments were administered by daily gavage for 45 days. An additional group of animals treated with mercuric chloride were permitted to recover for 45 days after mercuric chloride treatments. Parameters studied included serum testosterone, epididymal sperm count, motility, and morphology, epididymal and vas deferens adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), phosphorylase, sialic acid, glycogen and protein, testicular succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), phosphatases, cholesterol, ascorbic acid, and glutathione. Fertility was evaluated by sperm positive vaginal smears after overnight cohabitation with a female. Mercuric chloride produced a reduction in epididymal sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm viability, and there were no sperm-positive smears in this group. Biochemical tests from the male reproductive organs were also altered by mercuric chloride treatment. Coadministration of vitamin E with mercuric chloride prevented the changes in sperm and biochemical parameters and was associated with control rates of sperm positive smears after cohabitation. Animals given vitamin E with mercuric chloride also had lower concentrations of mercury in the testis, epididimyis, and vas deferens. Permitting animals to recover for 45 days after mercuric chloride treatment resulted in partial recovery of sperm and biochemical parameters. Vitamin E cotreatment has a protective role against mercury-induced male reproductive toxicity.	0
12512601	Evidence for a local effect of leptin in bovine mammary gland. On average, high-energy diets promoting body growth rates above 1 kg/d before puberty impair mammary development by 15 to 20% in cattle. We hypothesized that leptin, a protein produced by adipocytes, mediates the inhibitory effect of high-energy diets on mammary development. Therefore, our objectives were to determine the effect of leptin on mammary epithelial cell proliferation, and the distribution of mRNA for two leptin receptor isoforms in prepubertal bovine mammary glands and other peripheral tissues. Addition of leptin to culture media containing either 5 ng/ml of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) or 1% fetal bovine serum decreased DNA synthesis of a bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T) in a dose-dependent manner. The minimal doses of leptin that decreased IGF-I- and fetal bovine serum-stimulated cell proliferation were 64 and 1 ng/ml, respectively. In addition, we determined that MAC-T cells and isolated bovine mammary epithelial cells express the long form of leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) mRNA. Ob-Rb mRNA was detected in all bovine tissues examined. In contrast with reports on other species, mRNA expression of the short form of leptin receptor (Ob-Ra) was detected only in bovine liver, pituitary body, and spleen. These results support the concept that leptin mediates the inhibitory effect of high-energy diets on mammary development.	0
18355986	Courtship behaviour in Japanese macaques during heterosexual and homosexual consortships. Female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) in the Arashiyama population near Kyoto, Japan, are unusual, in that they exhibit what many would consider to be male-typical sexual characteristics. Specifically, they mount other females within the context of temporary, but exclusive, sexual relationships (i.e., homosexual consortships) and they sometimes exhibit a preference for female sexual partners, even when given the choice of a sexually motivated male alternative. In this study, we examined whether female Japanese macaques also exhibited male-typical patterns of courtship behaviour during homosexual consortships. Data were collected on courtship behaviour during heterosexual and homosexual consortships in free-ranging Japanese macaques from the Arashiyama (Japan) population. We analyzed the occurrence of 12 different courtship behaviours during 3374 heterosexual inter-mount intervals and 1412 homosexual inter-mount intervals. Sex differences between heterosexually consorting males and females existed for only two of the 12 courtship behaviours we investigated: inclined-back presentations and sexual vocalizations. Dominant and subordinate homosexually consorting females were sex-typical in their expression of inclined-back presentations and sexual vocalizations. Consequently, facultative same-sex sexual partner preference, mounting and consortships do not co-occur with male-typical patterns of courtship behaviour in female Japanese macaques.	0
11052919	Comparison of pulse-wave velocity in different aortic regions in relation to the extent and severity of atherosclerosis between young and older Kurosawa and Kusanagi-hypercholesterolemic (KHC) rabbits. The present study was performed to investigate the effects of the development of atherosclerosis on foot-to-foot pulse-wave velocity (PWV) from the ascending aorta to different positions along the aorta in Kurosawa and Kusanagi-Hypercholesterolemic (KHC) rabbits aged 10-12 and 22-24 months old, in relation to the percentage fractional lesioned area (PFLA) in different aortic regions through which the pulse wave travels, as well as the rheological and pathohistological properties of the aortic wall. PWV, when measured in the KHC rabbit from the ascending aorta to each aortic position, showed the highest value on passage through the aortic arch, decreased with conduction to the distal thoracic aorta, reached the minimal value on passage to the distal thoracic aorta or to the middle abdominal aorta in the 10-12- and 22-24-month-old animals respectively, and increased gradually on conduction to the iliac artery. PWV at all aortic regions examined was significantly greater in the 22-24-month-old than in the 10-12-month-old KHC rabbits. PFLA, when measured in the aortic region from the ascending aorta to each aortic position, was maximal in the aortic arch and decreased gradually towards the peripheral aorta in both age groups. PFLA in the 22-24-month-old group was significantly greater than that in the 10-12-month-old group in all aortic regions examined. The atherosclerotic aortic wall showed a significantly lower elastic modulus in the young KHC rabbits compared with age-matched normal rabbits. A significantly higher elastic modulus was observed in the older KHC rabbits compared with that in the younger animals of both strains, associated with the progression of sclerosis. These findings indicate that the increase in PWV is due mainly to an increase with aging in the extent and severity of atherosclerosis in vessels in which the pulse wave travels.	0
21605761	Glucose transporter and hypoxia-associated gene expression in the mammary gland of transition dairy cattle. Glucose is an important energy substrate, especially needed by dairy cows postpartum to support the onset of lactation. The prioritization and regulation of glucose uptake is accomplished, in part, by changes in expression of cellular glucose transport molecules (GLUT) within the mammary gland. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the expression and cell-type specific localization of GLUT and hypoxia-associated genes that may regulate GLUT expression over the transition period and through lactation in bovine mammary tissue and (2) determine functionality of GLUT on primary bovine mammary endothelial cells (BMEC). Mammary tissue biopsies were taken from cows at 15 d before calving and again at 1, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 d post-parturition for quantitative real-time PCR analysis of GLUT and hypoxia-associated genes. Additional mammary tissue samples were used to localize GLUT within the cells of the lobulo-alveolar system via fluorescence microscopy. Cultures of primary bovine mammary endothelial cells were used to confirm the functionality of GLUT with a fluorescent glucose analog uptake assay. Significant increases in GLUT1 gene expression were observed during early lactation, whereas both GLUT3 and GLUT4 gene expression increased during late lactation. The gene expression for 2 receptors of vascular endothelial growth factor increased significantly during early lactation and remained increased throughout lactation when compared with gene expression during the transition period. All GLUT were detected on cultured BMEC and were capable of internalizing glucose through GLUT-mediated mechanisms. These data suggest mammary vascular tissues express GLUT during lactation and BMEC express functional glucose transporters. A better understanding of glucose uptake at the endothelial level may prove to be critical to improve glucose absorption from the blood for utilization by mammary epithelial cells.	0
20463996	Natural abundance high field (43)Ca solid state NMR in cement science. This work is a systematic attempt to determine the possibilities and the limitations of the (43)Ca high field solid state NMR in the study of cement-based materials. The low natural abundance (0.135%) and small gyromagnetic ratio of (43)Ca present a serious challenge even in a high magnetic field. The NMR spectra of a number of cement compounds of known structure and composition are examined. The spectra of several phases important in cement science, e.g., anhydrous beta di-calcium silicate (beta-C(2)S) and tri-calcium (C(3)S) silicate were obtained for the first time and the relation of spectroscopic and structural parameters is discussed. The method was also applied to the hydrated C(3)S and synthetic calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) of different composition in order to understand the state of calcium and transformations in the structure during hydrolysis. The spectra of hydrated C(3)S reveals a calcium environment similar to that of the C-S-H samples and 11 A Tobermorite. These observations support the validity of using layered crystalline C-S-H systems as structural models for the C-S-H that forms in the hydration of Portland cement.	0
16836634	Evidence for a direct, short latency projection from the dorsal cochlear nucleus to the auditory thalamus in the guinea pig. The auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) receives its main ascending input from the inferior colliculus (IC), which was considered to be an obligatory relay for all auditory inputs to the MGB. However, recent anatomical evidence in the rat [ (Malmierca et al. 2002) J. Neurosci., 22, 10891-10897] has confirmed the presence of a direct pathway from the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) to the medial MGB, bypassing the IC, as previously suggested in the chimpanzee [ (Strominger et al. 1977) J. Comp. Neurol., 172, 349-366]. We show that this direct pathway is also present in the guinea pig and apparently results in short latency responses in the thalamus. Injection of anterograde tracer into the DCN of five adult guinea pigs revealed terminal boutons and axonal swellings distributed throughout the medial MGB, but absent from all other MGB subdivisions. Electrophysiological recordings made from 39 adult guinea pigs (24 male _ 15 female) showed neurons in the medial MGB responded with significantly shorter latencies to acoustic clicks (7.8 ms) than those from the ventral (11.0 ms), dorsal (14.4 ms), or shell (16.5 ms) MGB, consistent with the direct pathway from the DCN. The function of the direct pathway is not known but may be related to the fast responses and the role of the medial MGB in integrating combined somatosensory and auditory inputs. Short latency responses may be important in priming the auditory cortex to prepare it for rapid analysis and in recruiting the amygdala for rapid emotional responses such as fear.	0
9073453	Mist1: a novel basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor exhibits a developmentally regulated expression pattern. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins often belong to a family of transcription factors that bind to the DNA target sequence -CANNTG- (E-box) that is present in the promoter or enhancer regions of numerous developmentally regulated genes. In this study, we report the isolation and initial characterization of a novel bHLH factor, termed Mist1, that was identified by virtue of its ability to interact with E-box regulatory elements in a yeast \"one-hybrid\" screening procedure. Northern analysis revealed that Mist1 transcripts are expressed in several adult tissues, including stomach, liver, lung, and spleen but no expression is detected in the heart, brain, kidney, or testis. During mouse embryogenesis, Mist1 mRNA is first observed at E10.5 in the primitive gut and in the developing lung bud. Expression persists through E16.5 and remains restricted primarily to the epithelial lining. Mist1 also is detected in skeletal muscle tissues beginning at E12.5, persisting throughout all embryonic stages examined although in older embryos and in the adult expression becomes severely reduced. At later developmental times, Mist1 transcripts also are found in the pancreas, submandibular gland, and adult spleen. As predicted, the Mist1 protein is nuclear and binds efficiently to E-box sites as a homodimer. Mist1 also is capable of binding to E-box elements when complexed as a heterodimer with the widely expressed E-proteins, E12 and E47. Surprisingly, although Mist1 binds to E-boxes in vivo, the Mist1 protein lacks a functional transcription activation domain. These observations suggest that Mist1 may function as a unique regulator of gene expression in several different embryonic and postnatal cell lineages.	0

18543133	Rituximab-induced acute thrombocytopenia: a case report and review of the literature. Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the phosphoprotein CD20. Because of its efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile, rituximab is now commonly used for the treatment of CD20-positive B-cell malignancies, including B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, rituximab-induced acute thrombocytopenia is an extremely rare side effect. We report a case of acute thrombocytopenia occurring immediately after rituximab infusion in a mantle cell lymphoma patient with bone marrow involvement and massive splenomegaly. Although the mechanism of thrombocytopenia is still unclear, it is possible that tumor burden, bone marrow involvement, the presence of infusion-related symptoms, and mantle cell histology are related to this rare complication of rituximab therapy. Hence, rituximab should be used with caution in patients who have these factors, and clinicians must be aware of this rare, but serious, side effect.	0
24249775	Entropy and irreversibility in dynamical systems. A method of defining non-equilibrium entropy for a chaotic dynamical system is proposed which, unlike the usual method based on Boltzmann's principle S = klog W, does not involve the concept of a macroscopic state. The idea is illustrated using an example based on Arnold's 'cat' map. The example also demonstrates that it is possible to have irreversible behaviour, involving a large increase of entropy, in a chaotic system with only two degrees of freedom.	0
15540504	The transformation of consequential functions in accordance with the relational frames of same and opposite. Although the literature on reinforcement in behavioral psychology is extensive, few studies have examined the derived transformation of reinforcing functions in accordance with equivalence classes, and no published research has yet examined the derived transformation of consequential functions in accordance with nonequivalence relations. In the present study, which consisted of four experiments, the basic preparation was as follows. First, an arbitrary stimulus, B2, was established as a conditioned punisher, using direct stimulus pairing. Following nonarbitrary relational training, designed to establish SAME and OPPOSITE contextual cues, subjects were exposed to arbitrary relational training using these contextual cues to establish A1 as the same as B1 and C1, and as opposite to B2 and C2. Subsequently, C2 (based on its Same relation with B2) functioned as a punisher and C1 (based on its Opposite relation with B2) functioned as a reinforcer in a simultaneous discrimination task. Critically, the C1 stimulus acquired reinforcing functions, based on the derived relation of Opposite, although no such function had actually been established for any member of the network. Furthermore, these effects were observed across ABA reversals in the baseline contingencies.	0
9665647	Cortical plasticity in perceptual learning demonstrated by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Performance on a wide range of perceptual tasks improves with practice. Most accounts of perceptual learning are concerned with changes in neuronal sensitivity or changes in the way a stimulus is represented. Another possibility is that different areas of the brain are involved in performing a task while learning it and after learning it. Here we demonstrate that the right parietal cortex is involved in novel but not learned visual conjunction search. We observed that single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the right parietal cortex impairs visual conjunction search when the stimuli are novel and require a serial search strategy, but not once the particular search task has been learned. The effect of TMS returns when a different, novel, serial search task is presented.	0
12658416	Comparison of patient satisfaction after redo and primary fundoplications. BACKGROUND: Although much has been written about the results and patient satisfaction with fundoplication for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease, the reports have focused primarily on surgical successes. With the growing number of fundoplications being performed, more patients are requiring reoperation because of recurrent symptoms or side effects. Reports of success rates for reoperation are available, but information regarding patient satisfaction is limited. METHODS: All the patients undergoing fundoplication at our institution were sent short-form health surveys (SF-12), Gastroesophageal reflux disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaires (QOLRAD), and queries regarding long-term satisfaction. RESULTS: Between November 1992 and July 2000, 221 patients (198 primary and 23 redo) underwent fundoplication. There were 19 open cases (3 primary and 16 redo). In the primary group, 173 patients underwent Nissen, 23 underwent Toupet, and 2 underwent Collis fundoplications. In the redo group, 12 patients underwent Nissen, 9 underwent Toupet, 1 underwent Collis, and l underwent Belsey fundoplications. Follow-up surveys were completed for 130 patients (112 primary and 18 redo) at a mean of 32.6 months (range, 0.8-98 months). In the primary group, 87% of the patients were satisfied with their operation, as compared with 75% in the redo group. There was a trend toward higher SF-12 mental scores (46 +/- 12 vs 40 +/- 14; p = 0.07) and QOLRAD scores (6.2 +/- 1.3 vs 5.2 +/- 2.0; p = 0.07) in the primary fundoplication group. There was a significant difference in the SF-12 physical scores between the groups (32 +/- 13 for the primary group vs 18.5 +/- 11 for the redo group; p = 0.0002). Additionally, 61% of the patients in the redo group were again using antireflux medications, whereas only 24% of the patients in the primary group were using medications again. CONCLUSION: Gastroesophageal reflux disease symptom scores and quality-of-life scores for patients undergoing redo fundoplication are lower than the scores of patients having primary fundoplication. Quality of life is similar between primary and redo fundoplication patients in the mental component. However, redo patients do not do as well physically more than 2 years after surgery.	0
24384788	Impact of the competition between mating types on the cultivation of Tuber melanosporum: Romeo and Juliet and the matter of space and time. Major breakthroughs in our understanding of the life cycles of the symbiotic ascomycetes belonging to the genus Tuber have occurred over the last several years. A number of Tuber species produce edible fruiting bodies, known as truffles, that are marketed worldwide. A better understanding of the basic biological characteristics of Tuber spp. is likely to have tremendous practical relevance for their cultivation. Tuber melanosporum produces the most valuable black truffles and its genome has been recently sequenced. This species is now serving as a model for studying the biology of truffles. Here, we review recent progress in the understanding of sexual reproduction modalities in T. melanosporum. The practical relevance of these findings is outlined. In particular, the discoveries that T. melanosporum is heterothallic and that strains of different mating types compete to persist on the roots of host plants suggest that the spatial and temporal distributional patterns of strains of different mating types are key determinants of truffle fructification. The spatial segregation of the two mating types in areas where T. melanosporum occurs likely limits truffle production. Thus, host plant inoculation techniques and agronomic practices that might be pursued to manage T. melanosporum orchards with a balanced presence of the two mating partners are described.	0
9749325	Gender, migration, and career trajectories in Malaysia. With data from the Malaysian Family Life Survey, I use a continuous-state hazards model to study the impact of migration on the dynamics of individuals' careers. I distinguish between the effects of family migration and solo migration by gender. The results show that migration alters the career trajectory primarily by accelerating the process of occupational mobility rather than by increasing the level of occupational attainment. Further, the effect of migration on careers varies by type of migration, especially for women. Male-female differences in the outcome of family migration, however, are visible only in transitions into and out of employment.	0
11380381	Women's preference for a cesarean section: incidence and associated factors. BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined women's preferences for birth. The object of this study was to determine the incidence of women's preferred type of birth, and the reasons and factors associated with their preference. METHODS: Three hundred and ten women between 36 and 40 weeks' gestation were recruited from the antenatal clinic of a major metropolitan teaching hospital and the consulting rooms of six private obstetricians in Brisbane, Australia. Participants completed a questionnaire asking about their preferred type of birth, reasons for their preference, preparation for childbirth, level of anxiety and concerns, and the influence of the primary caregiver. RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety women (93.5%) preferred a spontaneous vaginal birth; 20 women (6.4%) preferred a cesarean section. Of the latter group, most had a current obstetric complication or experienced a previously complicated delivery (p <0.001); 1 woman (0.3%) preferred a cesarean section in the absence of any known current or previous obstetric complication. Women who preferred a cesarean section were more anxious, were generally poorly informed of the risks of this procedure, and/or overestimated the safety of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Women who preferred a cesarean section were more likely to have experienced this type of birth previously and to have negative feelings about it. To decrease women's preference for a cesarean section, practitioners should reduce the primary cesarean delivery rate and improve the quality of emotional care for women who require a cesarean section. Caregivers should engage in a sensitive discussion of the risks and benefits of various birth options, including a vaginal birth after cesarean, with women who have previously experienced a cesarean birth before they make decisions about mode of delivery in a subsequent pregnancy.	0
17189469	Delivery mode and efficacy of BMP-2 in association with implants. Bone healing may be improved in implant patients by the administration of osteogenic agents, such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). But the efficacy of BMP-2 depends upon its mode of application. We hypothesized that BMP-2 is capable of a higher osteogenic efficacy when delivered physiologically, viz., when incorporated into a calcium-phosphate carrier that mimics mineralized bone matrix, than when administered via simple pharmacological modes, such as by adsorption onto a carrier surface. Using an ectopic rat model, we compared the osteoinductive efficacies of calcium-phosphate implant-coatings bearing either incorporated, adsorbed, or incorporated and adsorbed BMP-2. When adsorbed directly onto the naked implant surface, BMP-2 was not osteogenic. When adsorbed onto a calcium-phosphate coating, it was osteoinductive, but not highly efficacious. When BMP-2 was incorporated into calcium-phosphate coatings, it was a potent bone-inducer, whose efficacy was compromised, not potentiated, by the additional deposition of an adsorbed pool.	0
22923042	How to put things together. Instructions for putting things together or understanding how things work are notoriously frustrating. Performance relies on constructing mental models of the object and the actions of the object from text or diagrams or both. Here, we show that instructions can be improved by turning users into designers and deriving design principles from their designs. People first assembled an object and then crafted assembly instructions, using text alone or text and diagrams. Some were required to be brief and to include only the most essential information. Users' instructions had a narrative structure with an introduction, a middle, and an end. The essential middle described or depicted the step-by-step sequence of actions on parts. Diagrams were regarded as fundamental, and redundancy of depictions and descriptions desirable. These design principles have wide applicability to many kinds of explanations.	0
24247975	Cerium chloride reduces enamel lesion initiation and progression in vitro. AIM: Determination of the potential of cerium chloride to reduce artificial carious mineral loss and lesion depth progression. METHODS: A total of 160 enamel samples were prepared from 40 bovine lower central incisors. Crowns were sectioned into four pieces, embedded in acrylic resin, ground flat and allocated to eight groups (S1-S4 and D1-D4; n = 20). Specimens of groups D1-D4 were stored (for 7 days) in a demineralizing buffer solution to induce caries-like lesions. Afterwards, samples were treated for 30 s with one of the following solutions: placebo (S1 and D1), amine fluoride (S2 and D2), cerium chloride (S3 and D3) and a combination of fluoride and cerium chloride (S4 and D4). After another 7 (D1-D4) or 14 (S1-S4) days in demineralizing buffer solution, integrated mineral loss and lesion depth were determined by transversal microradiography and compared by Scheff  's post hoc tests. RESULTS: In groups S1-S4, the highest values for integrated mineral loss and lesion depth were observed for group S1 (placebo), the lowest values for group S4. The results in groups S2-S4 were not significantly different. In groups D1-D4, the highest values for integrated mineral loss and lesion depth were observed for group D1 (placebo), the lowest values in groups D3 and D4. In group D2, integrated mineral loss and lesion depth were significantly lower as compared to D1, but significantly higher compared to groups D3 and D4. CONCLUSION: Cerium chloride and its combination with fluoride are able to significantly reduce carious mineral loss and the progression of lesion depth.	0
7902340	Screening of human bladder tumors and urine sediments for the presence of H-ras mutations. A series of 111 human bladder tumors were screened using oligonucleotide mutant specific probes, restriction enzyme analysis and single-stranded confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) for the presence of H-ras activation events. Thirty-three tumors were found to harbor H-ras mutations where a glycine to valine (G-->T) change in codon 12 was the most common point mutation recorded (26 tumors). Additional mutations involved glycine to cysteine at codon 13 (2 tumors) and glutamine to arginine/lysine/leucine at codon 61 (3/1/1 tumors, respectively). Ambiguous signals recorded with oligonucleotide probes were further analyzed using SSCP analysis revealing the presence of H-ras mutations in restricted regions of some tumors. The apparent sensitivity of SSCP enabled us to extend this study to DNA isolated from urine sediments where 4 of the 9 patients studied showed representation of mutant H-ras. Our study demonstrates a sensitive, non-invasive assay for the screening of urine-borne cells, with no requirement for prior knowledge of the mutational change at the H-ras locus.	0

20022960	Heparan sulfate is required for embryonic stem cells to exit from self-renewal. Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) must select between alternative fates of self-renewal and lineage commitment at each division during continuous proliferation. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a highly sulfated polysaccharide and is present abundantly on the ESC surface. In this study, we investigated the role of HS in ESC self-renewal by examining Ext1(-/-) ESCs that are deficient in HS. We found that Ext1(-/-) ESCs retained their self-renewal potential but failed to transit from self-renewal to differentiation upon removal of leukemia inhibitory factor. Furthermore, we found that the aberrant cell fate commitment is caused by defects in fibroblast growth factor signaling, which directly retained high expression of the pluripotency gene Nanog in Ext1(-/-) ESCs. Therefore, our studies identified and defined HS as a novel factor that controls ESC fate commitment and also delineates that HS facilitates fibroblast growth factor signaling, which, in turn, inhibits Nanog expression and commits ESCs to lineage differentiation.	0
21301080	Nonvolatile gating effects on radicals-containing vanadium oxide nanowires by gas molecule absorption and diffusion. The charge conduction of a single nanowire of radicals-containing vanadium oxides was experimentally studied and found to be modulated by different gas exposures, showing a gating effect by the adsorption and absorption of different gas molecules. After N(2) and O(2) gas are introduced, the nanowires show an abrupt increase of the resistance but show the opposite trend within a longer timescale of several ks. The introduction of N(2) and O(2) can respectively 'write' the nanowire into high and low resistance states, which are metastable in a high vacuum. The long-term gating effect which was attributed to the interlayer diffusion of the gas molecules can be registered on the nanowire in the high vacuum environment.	0

20890639	Electrospinning of small diameter 3-D nanofibrous tubular scaffolds with controllable nanofiber orientations for vascular grafts. The control of nanofiber orientation in nanofibrous tubular scaffolds can benefit the cell responses along specific directions. For small diameter tubular scaffolds, however, it becomes difficult to engineer nanofiber orientation. This paper reports a novel electrospinning technique for the fabrication of 3-D nanofibrous tubular scaffolds with controllable nanofiber orientations. Synthetic absorbable poly-  -caprolactone (PCL) was used as the model biomaterial to demonstrate this new electrospinning technique. Electrospun 3-D PCL nanofibrous tubular scaffolds of 4.5  mm in diameter with different nanofiber orientations (viz. circumferential, axial, and combinations of circumferential and axial directions) were successfully fabricated. The degree of nanofiber alignment in the electrospun 3-D tubular scaffolds was quantified by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. The results indicated that excellent circumferential nanofiber alignment could be achieved in the 3-D nanofibrous PCL tubular scaffolds. The nanofibrous tubular scaffolds with oriented nanofibers had not only directional mechanical property but also could facilitate the orientation of the endothelial cell attachment on the fibers.

AIM: The purpose was to assess the direct costs of screening for high blood pressure and blood glucose in dental care and of follow-up in primary health care and, based on these data, arrive at a prediction function. Study population. All subjects coming for routine check-ups at three dental health clinics were invited to have blood pressure or blood glucose measurements; 1,623 agreed to participate. Subjects screening positive were referred to their primary health care centres for follow-up. METHODS: Information on individual screening time was registered during the screening process, and information on accountable time, costs for the screening staff, overhead costs, and analysis costs for the screening was obtained from the participating dental clinics. The corresponding items in primary care, i.e. consultation time, number of follow-up appointments, accountable time, costs for the follow-up staff, overhead costs, and analysis costs during follow-up were obtained from the primary health care centres. RESULTS: The total screening costs per screened subject ranged from    7.4 to    9.2 depending on subgroups, corresponding to 16.7-42.7 staff minutes. The corresponding follow-up costs were    57-   91. The total resource used for screening and follow-up per diagnosis was 563-3,137 staff minutes. There was a strong relationship between resource use and numbers needed to screen (NNS) to find one diagnosis (P < 0.0001, degree of explanation 99%). CONCLUSIONS: Screening and follow-up costs were moderate and appear to be lower for combined screening of blood pressure and blood glucose than for separate screening. There was a strong relationship between resource use and NNS.	0

18368587	Combinatorial materials research applied to the development of new surface coatings IX: an investigation of novel antifouling/fouling-release coatings containing quaternary ammonium salt groups. Polysiloxane coatings containing chemically-bound (\"tethered\") quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) moieties were investigated for potential application as environmental-friendly coatings to control marine biofouling. A combinatorial/high-throughput approach was applied to the investigation to enable multiple variables to be probed simultaneously and efficiently. The variables investigated for the moisture-curable coatings included QAS composition, ie alkyl chain length, and concentration as well as silanol-terminated polysiloxane molecular weight. A total of 75 compositionally unique coatings were prepared and characterized using surface characterization techniques and biological assays. Biological assays were based on two different marine microorganisms, a bacterium, Cellulophaga lytica and a diatom, Navicula incerta, as well as a macrofouling alga, Ulva. The results of the study showed that all three variables influenced coating surface properties as well as antifouling (AF) and fouling-release (FR) characteristics. The incorporation of QAS moieties into a polysiloxane matrix generally resulted in an increase in coating surface hydrophobicity. Characterization of coating surface morphology revealed a heterogeneous, two-phase morphology for many of the coatings investigated. A correlation was found between water contact angle and coating surface roughness, with the contact angle increasing with increasing surface roughness. Coatings based on the QAS moiety containing the longest alkyl chain (18 carbons) displayed the highest micro-roughness and, thus, the most hydrophobic surfaces. With regard to AF and FR properties, coatings based on the 18 carbon QAS moieties were very effective at inhibiting C. lytica biofilm formation and enabling easy removal of Ulva sporelings (young plants) while coatings based on the 14 carbon QAS moities were very effective at inhibiting biofilm growth of N. incerta.	0

20011241	Noninvasively characterizing the different alphavbeta3 expression patterns in lung cancers with RGD-USPIO using a clinical 3.0T MR scanner. The adhesion molecule alphavbeta3 integrin plays an important role in tumor development and metastases. We demonstrated the specificity of the probe to alphavbeta3 integrin with transmission electron microcopy (TEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The in vivo targeting behavior of the probe was examined in 2 tumor models with different alphavbeta3 expression patterns by a 3.0T MRI scanner. MR imaging showed that R2* pseudo-color pictures of A549 lung cancer tumor was different from that of 3LL lung cancer. For A549 tumor, an homogeneous decrease of signal intensity was observed throughout the tumor, which was more evident in the periphery or central areas. Histological studies revealed that alphavbeta3 integrin was expressed both on the tumor vessel and tumor cells for A549 tumor. Our findings indicated that it was possible to noninvasively characterize the different alphavbeta3 expression pattern in lung cancers with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide conjugated ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (RGD-USPIO) using a clinical 3.0T MR scanner. Nevertheless, the way of imaging targeting presentation of the probe differed in tumors with different alphavbeta3 expression patterns.	0
15839443	The artificial lung facility at Brown: more than a dozen years with Pierre Galletti. Beginning in 1969, Pierre Galletti and his colleagues established a laboratory at Brown University, which, initially and for many years, was involved with artificial lungs. Various projects budded out of this, including the following: the establishment of standards for oxygenator performance, which anticipated Food and Drug Administration requirements; studies of thrombosis and other pathologies, which could be reduced by design changes; long-term, pumpless arterio-venous (A-V) bypass; early hybrid pancreas and other artificial organs; implantable lungs; and spin off companies. The current report outlines the history, philosophy, collaborations, and major results of the laboratory, as well as how the principal investigators simultaneously moved into research areas outside of artificial lungs in the late 1980s.	0

8543204	Autologous platelet concentrate for the treatment of full-thickness macular holes. BACKGROUND: To improve the anatomic success rate in the surgery of full-thickness macular holes, we tested, in a prospective pilot study, the effects of autologous platelet concentrate deposited on the macula at the end of surgery. METHODS: Two consecutive groups of patients were compared. Twenty eyes (group 1, mean symptom duration 11 months) were operated on with injection of an autologous platelet concentrate on the macula after fluid-gas exchange. Another 20 eyes (group 2, mean symptom duration 11 months) were subsequently operated on without autologous platelet concentrate. For all stage 3 holes, posterior hyaloid was detached en bloc at the level of the optic disc. The patient was left supine for 24 h after surgery, and then remained face down for 10 days. RESULTS: In group 1, 19 cases were an anatomic success, i.e. there was flattening of the retina surrounding the hole and reattachment of the edge of the hole to the retinal pigment epithelium; in 9 cases the hole was even undetectable. Final visual acuity was 0.5 or more in 9 eyes, and 0.4 or more in 14. Visual acuity improved by two lines or more in 17 of the 19 successfully operated eyes. In group 2, only 13 cases were an anatomic success. The functional results for the successfully operated eyes were identical to those of group 1. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggested that autologous platelet concentrate could significantly improve the success rate in macular hole surgery and led us to begin a comparative, prospective, randomized trial.	0
8800630	Epilepsy and prolactin in adults: a clinical review. Serum levels of prolactin may increase as a consequence of epileptic seizures. The hormone release is caused by the propagation of epileptic activity, usually from the temporal lobe to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Due to the intensity of the epileptic afterdischarge, a rise is seen in approximately 60% of complex partial seizures. Prolactin usually fails to rise after psychogenic seizures, therefore, postictal prolactin levels can be used to differentiate between epileptic and psychogenic seizures. However, a subclassification of epileptic seizures by means of prolactin measurement is not possible. In repetitive seizures, prolactin may show a decrease in its postictal release. This is more common in status epilepticus, probably as a result of a diminished propagation of ictal activity during the course of status epilepticus. The influence of chronic epileptic discharges and anticonvulsant medication on prolactin release is moderate.	0

24107561	New antibody and immunoassay pretreatment strategy to screen polychlorinated biphenyls in Korean transformer oil. Development and modifications are described that expand the application of an immunoassay from the detection of Kanechlors (Japanese technical PCBs mixtures) to the detection of Aroclors (U. S. technical PCB mixtures, used in Korea) in contaminated Korean transformer oil. The first necessary modification was the development of a new antibody with a reactivity profile favorable for Aroclors. The second modification was the addition of a second column to the solid-phase extraction method to reduce assay interference caused by the Korean oil matrix. The matrix interference is suspected to be caused by the presence of synthetic oils (or similar materials) present as contaminants. The modified assay was validated by comparison to high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis, and was shown to be tolerant of up to 10% of several common synthetic insulating oils. Finally the screening performance of the modified assay was evaluated using 500 used transformer oil samples of Korean origin, and was shown to have good performance in terms of false positive and false negative rates. This report provides evidence for the first establishment of immunoassay screening for Aroclor based PCB contamination in Korean transformer oil.	0

22617012	Large single crystals of graphene on melted copper using chemical vapor deposition. A simple method is presented for synthesizing large single crystal graphene domains on melted copper using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This is achieved by performing the reaction above the melting point of copper (1090   C) and using a molybdenum or tungsten support to prevent balling of the copper from dewetting. By controlling the amount of hydrogen during growth, individual single crystal domains of monolayer graphene greater than 200  m are produced within a continuous film. Stopping growth before a complete film is formed reveals individual hexagonal domains of graphene that are epitaxially aligned in their orientation. Angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to show that the graphene grown on copper exhibits a linear dispersion relationship and no sign of doping. HRTEM and electron diffraction reveal a uniform high quality crystalline atomic structure of monolayer graphene.	0
7061238	Enzymic heterogeneity of adrenocortical lysosomes: an X-ray microanalytical study. The enzymic heterogeneity of the lysosomal system has been demonstrated earlier. This study was concerned whether or not the lysosomes of the two outer zones of the rat adrenal cortex reveal any population characteristics on the basis of the activity of two enzymes. A double incubation method was used for the simultaneous electron cytochemical demonstration of acid phosphatase and arylsulphatase activity in the zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata of the adrenal. Lysosomes in semi-thin (0.5 micrometer) or ultra-thin sections were analysed with an ORTEC energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyser mounted on a JEOL TEMSCAN-100C electron microscope. Linearity of the amount of reaction deposit with incubation time was found for both enzymes. On the basis of the proportion of the two reaction products in individual lysosomes, three populations were distinguished. One with high acid-phosphatase and low, if any, arylsulphatase activity was only present in the zona glomerulosa. The other two populations exhibited stronger or weaker prevalence of arylsulphatase activity and were common in both zones. The values of the Ba/Pb ratio characteristic of each population changed with the reaction sequence but the principal distribution pattern did not. The nature of the interaction between the two reactions, as well as the possible functional significance of the lysosomal populations in the adrenal cortex, are discussed but are not yet clarified.	0
20849235	Returning to freud. In this article I attempt to renew interest in the importance of Freud's work for both the practice of psychoanalysis and in the training of psychoanalysts. I hope to stimulate readers to return to Freud's writings in detail, which seem to be increasingly neglected these days both in training and in the many conflicting contemporary models of psychoanalysis. I propose that the identity of psychoanalysis can still be based on Freud's work, and his approach can form a fundamental center from which there are various channels of divergence that may be useful when the patient seems to need them. But the centerpiece of our training and our orientation, I suggest, should be the basic principles spelled out in Freud's numerous volumes, in spite of the many changes and contradictions and even outright mistakes and cultural blindness he displays in some instances. I proceed to review some of these basic principles in the hope of persuading the reader to return to Freud again. I present these with some commentary from my own 50 years of clinical experience. I briefly review the clinical cornerstones of Freud's approach as developed in his early books, his controversial papers on technique, and his later emendations, which constitute the actual reality of Freud at work in psychoanalysis (that sometimes--and sometimes wisely--violates his papers on technique), and I discuss his notion of curative factors in psychoanalysis. All of this is to revive an interest in Freud's thought and to emphasize the lasting value of his work, both in its contemporary clinical relevance and as the proposed foundation stone of our identity as psychoanalysts.	0

18701620	beta-Subunit overexpression alters the stoicheometry of assembled Na-K-ATPase subunits in MDCK cells. In eukaryotic cells, the apparent maintenance of 1:1 stoicheometry between the Na-K-ATPase alpha- and beta-subunits led us to question whether this was alterable and thus if some form of regulation was involved. We have examined the consequences of overexpressing Na-K-ATPase beta1-subunits using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing flag-tagged beta1-subunits (beta1flag) or Myc-tagged beta1-subunits (beta1myc) under the control of a tetracycline-dependent promoter. The induction of beta1flag subunit synthesis in MDCK cells, which increases beta1-subunit expression at the plasma membrane by more than twofold, while maintaining stable alpha1 expression levels, revealed that all mature beta1-subunits associate with alpha1-subunits, and no evidence of \"free\" beta1-subunits was obtained. Consequently, the ratio of assembled beta1- to alpha1-subunits is significantly increased when \"extra\" beta-subunits are expressed. An increased beta1/alpha1 stoicheometry is also observed in cells treated with tunicamycin, suggesting that the protein-protein interactions involved in these complexes are not dependent on glycosylation. Confocal images of cocultured beta1myc-expressing and beta1flag-expressing MDCK cells show colocalization of beta1myc and beta1flag subunits at the lateral membranes of neighboring cells, suggesting the occurrence of intercellular interactions between the beta-subunits. Immunoprecipitation using MDCK cells constitutively expressing beta1myc and tetracycline-regulated beta1flag subunits confirmed beta-beta-subunit interactions. These results demonstrate that the equimolar ratio of assembled beta1/alpha1-subunits of the Na-K-ATPase in kidney cells is not fixed by the inherent properties of the interacting subunits. It is likely that cellular mechanisms are present that regulate the individual Na-K-ATPase subunit abundance.	0

15045455	Flame AAS/flame AES for trace determination in fresh and used lubricating oils with sample introduction by hydraulic high-pressure nebulization. In hydraulic high-pressure nebulization (HHPN) an aerosol is produced by means of an HPLC-pump and a special nebulization nozzle, applying a pressure of about 200 bar. This spray technique has been employed for sample introduction of mineral oil samples in flame atomic absorption/flame emission spectrometry. The determination of the trace elements Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Na, Ni, Pb, Si and V has been investigated. Viscosity hardly acts upon the sensitivity of the determination, thereby avoiding a time consuming dilution of oil samples. By means of two interconnecting sampling valves a calibration method based on the standard addition technique can be performed which is both simple and easy to carry out. In samples of used oils, results for Cu and Pb equalled those of XRF-analysis. Regarding Fe traces, data obtained from AAS and XRF measurement correlate. In comparison with sample uptake by pneumatic nebulization, which is restricted to diluted oil samples, detection limits decrease by a factor of 2 to 4, indicating the dilution required in pneumatic nebulization.	0
8314581	The isolation of cDNAs from OATL1 at Xp 11.2 using a 480-kb YAC. Using an ornithine-delta-aminotransferase (OAT) cDNA, we identified five YACs that cover two nonadjacent OAT-related loci in Xp11.2-p11.3, designated OATL1 (distal) and OATL2 (proximal). Because several retinal degenerative disorders map to this region, we used YAC2 (480 kb), which covers the most distal part of OATL1, as a probe to screen a retinal cDNA library. From 8 x 10(4) plaques screened, we isolated 13 clones. Two were OAT cDNAs. The remaining 11 were divided into eight groups by cross-hybridization. Groups 1-4 contain cDNAs that originate from single-copy X-linked genes in YAC2. Each has an open reading frame of > 500 bp and detects one or more transcripts on a Northern blot. The gene for each was sublocalized and ordered in YAC2. The cDNAs in groups 5-8 contained two or more Alu sequences, had no open reading frames, and did not detect transcripts. The cDNAs from groups 1-4 provide expressed sequence tags and identify candidate genes for the genetic disorders that map to this region.	0
19643114	Morphogenesis by coupled regulatory networks: reliable control of positional information and proportion regulation. Based on a non-equilibrium mechanism for spatial pattern formation we study how position information can be controlled by locally coupled discrete dynamical networks, similar to gene regulation networks of cells in a developing multicellular organism. As an example we study the developmental problems of domain formation and proportion regulation in the presence of noise, as well as in the presence of cell flow. We find that networks that solve this task exhibit a hierarchical structure of information processing and are of similar complexity as developmental circuits of living cells. Proportion regulation is scalable with system size and leads to sharp, precisely localized boundaries of gene expression domains, even for large numbers of cells. A detailed analysis of noise-induced dynamics, using a mean-field approximation, shows that noise in gene expression states stabilizes (rather than disrupts) the spatial pattern in the presence of cell movements, both for stationary as well as growing systems. Finally, we discuss how this mechanism could be realized in the highly dynamic environment of growing tissues in multicellular organisms.	0
12094959	Different enzyme activities of sialyltransferases in gynecological cancer cell lines. PURPOSE: Due to rarity of a relationship between sialyltransferase enzyme activities and gynecological cancers, we arranged the study to evaluate sialyltransferase enzyme activity in the various kinds of gynecological cancer cell lines. METHODS: Ten cell lines from various kinds of gynecological cancers and two cell lines from normal tissue were enrolled in this study. The activities of each subtype of sialyltransferases were detected using Gal beta1,3GalNAc-acetyl-lactosamine)-Obz1 (acceptor for ST2,3Gal I), Gal beta1,3GlcNAc beta1,3Gal beta1,4GlcNAc (acceptor for ST2,3Gal III), Gal beta1,4GlcNAc (acceptor for ST2,3Gal IV), asialo-bovine submaxillary mucin (acceptor for ST2,6GalNAc I), asialo-fetuin (acceptor for STalpha2,6GalNAc II), and fetuin (acceptor for ST2,6GalNAc III), respectively. The amounts of sialic acids were measured using fluorescein-conjugated Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) specific for alpha2,6-sialic acids and fluorescein-conjugated Maackia Amurensis agglutinin (MAA) specific for alpha2,3-sialic acids. RESULTS: The activities of two sialyltransferase subtypes, ST3Gal I _ ST6GalNAc II, were significantly higher in nearly all cell lines. More specifically, cervical cancer cell line-ME 180, ovarian cancer cell line-ES-2, and choriocarcinoma cell line-BeWo showed high levels of ST3Gal I enzyme activity; all gynecological cancer cell lines except endometrial cancer cell line-RL95-2 had high levels of ST6GalNAc II enzyme activity when compared with a normal control cell line--fibroblast cell line (CCD-966Sk). Cell lines tested in this study have diverse levels of surface alpha2,6-sialic acid sugar chains (enhanced SNA binding) when compared with alpha2,3-sialic acid sugar chains (enhanced MAA binding) but we found that some cell lines such as Ca Ski (cervical cancer cell line), CC7T (cervical cancer cell line), PA-I (ovarian cancer cell line), and BeWo showed significantly altered cell surface alpha2,6-sialic acid sugar chains. CONCLUSION: Increasing enzyme activity of ST3Gal I and ST6GalNAc II might be important in various kinds of gynecological cancers. More specifically, enhanced activity of sialyltransferases involving alpha2,6-sialic acid sugar chains might be more important in cancer development. Future studies will investigate whether the enzyme activity of these sialyltransferases can be helpful for clinical practice.	0

23410675	CO    and O    respiration kinetics in hydrocarbon contaminated soils amended with organic carbon sources used to determine catabolic diversity. Multiple substrate induced respiration (MSIR) assays which assess the response of soils to carbon source amendment are effective approaches to determine catabolic diversity of soils. Many assays are based on a single short term (<6 h) time point measurement and usually limited to CO2 production only. However, repeated measurements of both CO2 and O2 simultaneously can provide additional valuable information. In this study, a MSIR assay involving eight carbon sources was applied to three hydrocarbon contaminated soils using continuous CO2 and O2 respiration measurements. Based on cumulative CO2 and O2 measurements at 4, 24 and 120 h, the soils were found to be distinct in terms of their catabolic diversity. Most noteworthy, however, was the response to the addition of maleic acid which provided strong evidence of abiotic CO2 efflux to be the overriding process, raising questions about the interpretation of CO2 only responses from organic acid addition in MSIR assays.	0
17740324	ENHANCED PRODUCTION OF PENICILLIN IN FLUID MEDIUM CONTAINING CELLOPHANE. Enhanced production of penicillin is made possible by addition of Cellophane to fluid media. With Cellophane bags of suitable surface, the growth of the submerged and surface penicillin producing strains of Penicillium notatum is significantly faster and more abundant; penicillin makes its appearance earlier and reaches higher concentration in larger total volumes than in control cultures without Cellophane. Thus the gain with the method described is both in the rate of production as well as in the total yield of penicillin. The enhancement also occurs under conditions unfavorable for development of penicillin, namely, (a) with degenerated cultures of the mold; and (b) when the surface penicillin producing strain is grown in cultures with an unfavorably small [See Equation In PDF file] ratio (0.0315). There is also noted a markedly stabilizing effect of Cellophane upon the H-ion concentration of abundantly growing cultures during active production of penicillin. The stabilization is of significance, since the sharp rise in pH usually occurring in Penicillium cultures tends to destroy rapidly the penicillin.	0
18977048	Engineering microbes with synthetic biology frameworks. Typically, the outcome of biologically engineered unit operations cannot be controlled a priori due to the incorporation of ad hoc design into complex natural systems. To mitigate this problem, synthetic biology presents a systematic approach to standardizing biological components for the purpose of increasing their programmability and robustness when assembled with the aim to achieve novel biological functions. A complex engineered biological system using only standardized biological components is yet to exist. Nevertheless, current attempts to create and to implement modular, standardized biological components pave the way for the future creation of highly predictable artificial biological systems. Although synthetic biology frameworks can be applied to any biological engineering endeavor, this article will focus on providing a brief overview of advances in the field and its recent utilization for the engineering of microbes.	0
22532403	Simultaneous quantification of fat content and fatty acid composition using MR imaging. Not only the fat content but also the composition of fatty acids (FAs) in stored triglycerides might be of interest in the research on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In this study, a novel reconstruction approach is proposed that uses theoretical knowledge of the chemical structure of FAs to simultaneously quantify the fat fraction (FF) and the FAs composition (chain length cl, number of double bonds ndb, and number of methylene-interrupted double bonds nmidb) from multiple gradient echo images. Twenty phantoms with various fat contents (FF = 9-100%) and FA compositions (cl = 12.1-17.9, ndb = 0.23-5.10, and nmidb = 0.04-2.39) were constructed and imaged in a 3-T Siemens scanner. In addition, spectra were acquired in each phantom. Slopes and \"standard deviations from true values\" were used to investigate the accuracy of the two methods. The imaging method holds well in a comparison to the previously suggested spectroscopy method and showed similar overall accuracy. The in vivo feasibility was demonstrated in the thigh adipose tissue of a healthy volunteer. In conclusion, our developed method is a promising tool for FF and FA composition quantification.	0
20348304	ArcS, the cognate sensor kinase in an atypical Arc system of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The availability of oxygen is a major environmental factor for many microbes, in particular for bacteria such as Shewanella species, which thrive in redox-stratified environments. One of the best-studied systems involved in mediating the response to changes in environmental oxygen levels is the Arc two-component system of Escherichia coli, consisting of the sensor kinase ArcB and the cognate response regulator ArcA. An ArcA ortholog was previously identified in Shewanella, and as in Escherichia coli, Shewanella ArcA is involved in regulating the response to shifts in oxygen levels. Here, we identified the hybrid sensor kinase SO_0577, now designated ArcS, as the previously elusive cognate sensor kinase of the Arc system in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Phenotypic mutant characterization, transcriptomic analysis, protein-protein interaction, and phosphotransfer studies revealed that the Shewanella Arc system consists of the sensor kinase ArcS, the single phosphotransfer domain protein HptA, and the response regulator ArcA. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that HptA might be a relict of ArcB. Conversely, ArcS is substantially different with respect to overall sequence homologies and domain organizations. Thus, we speculate that ArcS might have adopted the role of ArcB after a loss of the original sensor kinase, perhaps as a consequence of regulatory adaptation to a redox-stratified environment.	0
16683618	Micellar enhanced ultrafiltration for arsenic(V) removal: effect of main operating conditions and dynamic modelling. In this work arsenic removal by micellar enhanced ultrafiltration (MEUF) was investigated using cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) in ceramic membrane apparatus. Permeability tests and discontinuous diafiltration tests were performed in different operating conditions to evaluate the effect of membrane pore size (20 and 50 nm), transmembrane pressure, pH, surfactant concentration (1-3 mM), and arsenic concentration (10-40 mg/L) on permeate flux decline, arsenic, and CPC rejections. These preliminary experimental results showed that a ceramic membrane with large pore size allows treament of high fluxes of concentrated arsenic-bearing solutions even by using low surfactant concentrations. Arsenic concentration in the permeate was at the 1 ppm level, with feed As concentrations (10 ppm) that are larger than those generally used in MEUF studies and with CPC amounts that are lower than the usual ones. In addition, operating conditions adopted in these tests obtained CPC concentrations in the permeate always lower than its critical micellar concentration (0.9 mM). Dynamic simulations of discontinuous two-step diafiltration tests allowed a simple and adequate representation of the performance of the process especially for 1 mM CPC, while discrepancies for 2.5 mM CPC level denoted complex interactions between CPC and As.	0
16550405	Evaluation of sampling technique and transport media for the diagnostics of adenoviral eye infections. Adenovirus sampling and transport. BACKGROUND: Human adenoviruses (HAdV) may cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, follicular conjunctivitis or epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). Especially, outbreaks of the latter may lead to severe economic losses when preventive measures are implemented too late. Thus, a safe sampling method, proper specimen transport conditions and a fast and sensitive diagnostic technique is mandatory. METHODS: Two commercially available virus transport systems (VTS) were compared with two NaCl-moisturised sampling devices, one of which comprises Dacron-tipped plastic-shafted swabs and the other a cotton-tipped wood-shafted swab, available in most ophthalmologists' offices. Downstream methods for specific detection of HAdV included direct immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of conjunctival swabs, virus isolation by cell culture and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of application of local anaesthetics prior to swabbing on subsequent detection of HAdV was investigated. RESULTS: Application of local anaesthetics had a positive influence on the amount of swabbed cells, thus increasing the chance of obtaining positive results by IFA. Neither isolation of HAdV by cell culture nor by qPCR was negatively influenced by this pretreatment. Surprisingly, both commercially available VTS performed significantly worse than the NaCl-moisturised swabs. This was shown with regard to virus recovery rates in cell culture as well as viral genome copy numbers in the qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, the following recommendations are provided to improve sampling, transport and diagnostic techniques regarding conjunctival swabs for diagnosis of human adenovirus infection: (1) application of local anaesthetics, (2) NaCl-moisturised VTS for shipment of specimens, and (3) detection of HAdV by qPCR. The latter method proved to be superior to virus isolation by cell culture, including subsequent identification by IFA, because it is faster, more sensitive and allows simultaneous handling of a number of samples. Hence, countermeasures to prevent further virus spread in an outbreak situation can be implemented earlier, thus reducing the number of subsequent adenoviral infections.	0
17599910	Variety of nucleotide sugar transporters with respect to the interaction with nucleoside mono- and diphosphates. Nucleotide sugar transporters have long been assumed to be antiporters that exclusively use nucleoside monophosphates as antiport substrates. Here we present evidence indicating that two other types of nucleotide sugar transporters exist that differ in their antiport substrate specificity. Biochemical studies using microsomes derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing either human (h) UGTrel7 or the Drosophila (d) FRC (Fringe connection) transporter revealed that (i) efflux of preloaded UDP-glucuronic acid from the yeast microsomes expressing hUGTrel7 was strongly enhanced by UDP-GlcNAc added in the external medium, but not by UMP or UDP, suggesting that hUGTrel7 may be described as a UDP-sugar/UDP-sugar antiporter, and (ii) addition of UDP-sugars, UDP, or UMP in the external medium stimulated the efflux of preloaded UDP-GlcNAc from the yeast microsomes expressing dFRC to a comparable extent, suggesting that UDP, as well as UMP, may serve as an antiport substrate of dFRC. Antiport of UDP-sugars with these specific substrates was reproduced and definitively confirmed using proteoliposomes reconstituted from solubilized and purified transporters. Possible physiological implications of these observations are discussed.	0
23308281	Geographical factors affecting bed net ownership, a tool for the elimination of Anopheles-transmitted lymphatic filariasis in hard-to-reach communities. Vector control, including the use of bed nets, is recommended as a possible strategy for eliminating lymphatic filariasis (LF) in post-conflict countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This study examined the geographical factors that influence bed net ownership in DRC in order to identify hard-to-reach communities that need to be better targeted. In particular, urban/rural differences and the influence of population density, proximity to cities and health facilities, plus access to major transport networks were investigated. Demographic and Health Survey geo-referenced cluster level data were used to map bed net coverage (proportion of households with at least one of any type of bed net or at least one insecticide-treated net (ITN)), and ITN density (ITNs per person) for 260 clusters. Bivariate and multiple logistic or Poisson regression analyses were used to determine significant relationships. Overall, bed net (30%) and ITN (9%) coverage were very low with significant differences found between urban and rural clusters. In rural clusters, ITN coverage/density was positively correlated with population density (r=0.25, 0.27 respectively, p<0.01), and negatively with the distance to the two largest cities, Kinshasa or Lubumbashi (r=-0.28, -0.30 respectively, p<0.0001). Further, ownership was significantly negatively correlated with distance to primary national roads and railways (all three measures), distance to main rivers (any bed net only) and distance to the nearest health facility (ITNs only). Logistic and Poisson regression models fitted to the rural cluster data indicated that, after controlling for measured covariates, ownership levels in the Bas-Congo province close to Kinshasa were much larger than that of other provinces. This was most noticeable when considering ITN coverage (odds ratio: 5.3, 95% CI: 3.67-7.70). This analysis provides key insights into the barriers of bed net ownership, which will help inform both LF and malaria bed net distribution campaigns as part of an integrated vector management strategy.	0

9790729	Sca1(+)/Mac1(+) nitric oxide-producing cells in the spleens of recipients early following bone marrow transplant suppress T cell responses in vitro. Spleen cells collected from allogeneic chimeras early after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) consistently showed suppressed proliferative responses to interleukin-2 in vitro and failed to proliferate in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays. However, isolation of Thy 1.2(+) T cells from the heterogeneous spleen cell suspension prior to culture resulted in heightened proliferation, suggesting the presence of cells capable of suppressing T cell responses in vitro. When separated into subpopulations by negative and positive selection with specific monoclonal antibodies, a non-T, non-B population with immunosuppressive properties was identified. The suppressive cells were found in the spleens of both allogeneic and syngeneic chimeras, but not normal donor mice. Suppressor activity was transient and typically declined by 3 weeks post-BMT. The cells suppressed the response of alloactivated T cells isolated from BMT chimeras as well as naive donor T cells in MLR assays in a dose-dependent manner. To explore the mechanism(s) involved in the suppression, the effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-specific mAb and the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor NG-methyl-l-arginine were examined. The results support a role for both IFN-gamma and NO in the suppressive activity. Separation of cells based on Mac-1 expression indicated that there were both Mac-1-enriched and Mac-1-depleted cells capable of producing NO, but that the Mac-1-depleted cells were the most potent suppressors in MLR assays. The Mac-1-depleted cells still contained a residual population of Mac-1(dim) cells which showed increased levels of Mac-1 expression after overnight culture. Intracellular staining with an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-specific mAb indicated that the NO-producing cells expressed the cell surface markers Mac-1 and Sca-1. When iNOS knockout transgenic mice were used as transplant donors, in vitro suppression of T cell responses was reduced but not eliminated, suggesting that other mechanism(s) could contribute to the suppression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Sca-1(+)/Mac-1(+) cells capable of producing NO are present in the spleens of recipients early after BMT and suggest that these cells may have immunoregulatory roles in vivo.	0
12656616	A versatile method for tuning the chemistry and size of nanoscopic features by living free radical polymerization. A novel approach is presented for manipulating the size and chemistry of nanoscopic features using a combination of contact molding and living free radical polymerization. In this approach a highly cross-linked photopolymer, based on a methacrylate/acrylate mixture, was patterned into submicrometer-sized features on a silicon wafer using a contact-molding technique. A critical component of the monomer mixture was the incorporation of an initiator containing monomer into the network structure, which provides sites for functional group amplification. Features ranging in size from 5 microm to <60 nm were accurately replicated by this process and living free radical polymerizations, both atom transfer radical and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), could be conducted from these initiating sites to yield polymer brushes which represent a grafted layer of linear chains attached to the original network polymer. Grafts consisting of polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(2-hydroxyethyl)methacrylate were grown with controlled thicknesses ranging from 10 to 143 nm and graft molecular weights of between 18 000 to 290 000 amu. As a result of this secondary graft process, feature sizes could be tuned from the original 100 nm down to 20 nm, and the surface chemistry varied from hydrophilic to hydrophobic starting from the same initial master pattern. The thin films and patterned features were characterized by contact angle, ellipsometry, optical, and atomic force microscopies.	0
18588209	Effects of paddle impeller geometry on power input and mass transfer in small-scale animal cell culture vessels. Process scaleup for stirred-tank animal cell cultures such as suspension and microcarrier cultures often begins at the bench scale in small spinner vessels. In order to initiate process development under the proper conditions, it is essential to know the physical conditions under which the cells are grown. In this article, power inputs and surface oxygen transfer rates to culture medium in 500-mL Corning spinner vessels were determined as a function of the impeller geometry, impeller height, and agitation speed. The results obtained indicate that power dissipation dependency differs from literature correlations and may compromise scale up at constant power input from these vessels. These results are of general utility to researchers using small-scale vessels.	0
14529908	Comparison of the results of liver transplantation for elective versus urgent indications. The authors present an analysis of early and remote liver transplantation outcomes related to the presence of emergent indications among 196 of the 209 operations performed from 1989 to April 2003; namely 178 elective and 18 emergent transplantations. Perioperative mortality was 15%. The survival rate during the first 12 months was 79.8% and within 3 years 73.5% among patients operated on an elective basis (UNOS 3 and 2B). In contrast, patients with acute liver failure (UNOS 1 and 2A) showed rates of 45%, 50%, and 47%, respectively. Liver transplant outcomes depend primarily on the urgency of an operation. Longterm results are much better among patients operated on electively. Liver transplantation in patients with acute hepatic insufficiency is burdened with a high 45% mortality.	0
18669923	The helix-loop-helix factors Id3 and E47 are novel regulators of adiponectin. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived cytokine with beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and the development of atherosclerosis. Id3 is a helix-loop-helix factor that binds to E-proteins such as E47 and inhibits their binding to DNA. Although the helix-loop-helix factor sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c is a known activator of adiponectin transcription, this study provides the first evidence of a role for Id3 and E47 in adiponectin expression. Decreased Id3 in differentiating adipocytes correlates with increased adiponectin expression and forced expression of Id3 inhibits adiponectin expression. Moreover, Id3-null mice have increased adiponectin expression in visceral fat tissue and in serum. We demonstrate that E47 potentiates SREBP-1c-mediated adiponectin promoter activation and that Id3 can dose-dependently inhibit this action via interaction with E47. Mutation of a consensus E47 binding site results in nearly complete loss of promoter activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate E47 binding to the endogenous adiponectin promoter both in vitro and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Binding is not detected in undifferentiated cells which express Id3 but peaks during differentiation in parallel with Id3 decline. This promoter binding can be completely abolished by the overexpression of Id3 and is enhanced in adipose tissue null for Id3. These data establish Id3 and E47 as novel regulators of SREBP-1c-mediated adiponectin expression in differentiating adipocytes and provide evidence that Id3 regulates adiponectin expression in vivo.	1
22180706	Prevention and management of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-induced small intestinal injury. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced small bowel injury is a topic that deserves attention since the advent of capsule endoscopy and balloon enteroscopy. NSAID enteropathy is common and is mostly asymptomatic. However, massive bleeding, stricture, or perforation may occur. The pathogenesis of small intestine injury by NSAIDs is complex and different from that of the upper gastrointestinal tract. No drug has yet been developed that can completely prevent or treat NSAID enteropathy. Therefore, a long-term randomized study in chronic NSAID users is needed.	0
8345185	Early signals in alloantigen induced B-cell proliferation. Comparison between B-cell triggering by intact allogeneic cells and solubilized alloantigen. Stimulation of B cells from BALB/c with allogeneic lymphocytes from C57BL/6 mice resulted in a slight increase in cytosolic Ca2+ but in the absence of proliferative response. Immunization of BALB/c mice with C57BL/6 total lymphocytes resulted in an enhancement of cytosolic Ca2+ and of B cell proliferation. Phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C was activated immediately after allogeneic stimulation as deduced by the concomitant rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. Translocation of protein kinase C from the cytosol toward the membranes paralleled the elevation in cytosolic free Ca2+. Activation of BALB/c B cells with solubilized alloantigen from the plasma membrane of C57BL/6 lymphocytes produced qualitatively the same early responses as the treatment with allogeneic cells, although quantitatively more intense. Concerning protein kinase C, an important degradation was observed in these conditions. Soluble alloantigen failed to promote B cell proliferation, being observed when cells were costimulated with a low concentrations (2 ng/ml) of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate before alloantigen addition. Analysis of the molecular weight of the active fraction of the solubilized alloantigen revealed the presence of a 51 kDa protein that mimicked all properties of the alloantigen preparation. This molecule was also recognized in Western blot by an anticlass I mAb and by the sera of immunized animals. A putative MHC class I antigen is proposed as the nature of the active molecule, and its interaction with specific membrane Ig on the B cell is analyzed. Although the results fit with a cellular response mediated through membrane Ig, the involvement of other B cell surface molecules interacting with the alloantigens cannot be disregarded.	0
19574707	Fibrinous anterior uveitis following laser in situ keratomileusis. A 29-year-old woman who underwent laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for myopic astigmatism in both eyes presented with severe pain, photophobia and decreased visual acuity in the left eye eight days after surgery. Examination revealed severe anterior uveitis with fibrinous exudates in the anterior chamber, flap edema and epithelial bullae. Laboratory investigations for uveitis were negative and the patient required systemic and intensive topical steroids with cycloplegics to control the inflammation. This case demonstrates that severe anterior uveitis may develop after LASIK and needs prompt and vigorous management for resolution.	0
16780828	Regulation of the retinal determination gene dachshund in the embryonic head and developing eye of Drosophila. The retinal determination gene dachshund is distantly related to the family of Ski/Sno proto-oncogenes and influences the development of a wide range of tissues including the embryonic head, optic lobes, brain, central nervous system as well as the post-embryonic leg, wing, genital and eye-antennal discs. We were interested in the regulatory mechanisms that control the dynamic expression pattern of dachshund and in this report we set out to ascertain how the transcription of dachshund is modulated in the embryonic head and developing eye-antennal imaginal disc. We demonstrate that the TGFbeta signaling cascade, the transcription factor zerknullt and several other patterning genes prevent dachshund from being expressed inappropriately within the embryonic head. Additionally, we show that several members of the eye specification cascade influence the transcription of dachshund during normal and ectopic eye development. Our results suggest that dachshund is regulated by a complex combinatorial code of transcription factors and signaling pathways. Unraveling this code may lead to an understanding of how dachshund regulates the development of many diverse tissue types including the eye.	0

9419892	Microsatellite variation in an introduced mouflon population. As previous studies of genetic polymorphism in the mouflon (Ovis gmelini) have not provided any valuable markers for population studies, we tested the capacity of microsatellites to index the genetic diversity of a recently introduced mouflon population. Six pairs of bovine primer amplified microsatellites in mouflon, and all six were polymorphic. Furthermore, despite the low number of founders, five loci had a high gene diversity in this introduced population. Unlike other genetic markers, microsatellites could be powerful to study the genetic structure of mouflon populations.	0
16258776	Treatment of in-stent restenosis with sirolimus-eluting-stents -- a six month clinical and angiographic follow-up. Treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a therapeutic challenge since many pharmacological and mechanical approaches have shown disappointing results except for brachytherapy. Drug-eluting stents (DES) have been reported to effectively reduce ISR in de novo lesions. We studied 55 consecutive patients with ISR in native coronary arteries and 7 with ISR in saphenous vein grafts (SVG) with elective indication for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), who underwent successful implantation with DES. No in-hospital postprocedural major adverse cardiac events were observed. All but one patient (n=61) underwent an angiographic follow-up at 183+/-30 days. Grade of stenosis was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) at index procedure and at control angiography. Restenosis (>50%) occurred in 5 patients (8.2%). Target vessel revascularization was performed in an additional 4 patients. Minimal intimal hyperplasia was observed in all segments covered by DES (late loss 0.08+/-0.37 mm, loss index 0.11+/-0.47). One patient suffered from subacute stent thrombosis due to discontinuation of clopidogrel medication. At six month follow-up two patients had died. Death was not related to a restenosis in the treated segment. Conclusion Our experiences with DES treatment of ISR lesions show good angiographic and clinical results at index procedure and at the 6 month follow-up with low sub acute thrombosis rate as compared with existing treatment modalities. Restenosis rate seems to be at least as low as reported for brachytherapy.	0
9090459	Upregulation of HLA class-I gene transcription in K562 cells by analogs of splenopentin (SP-5) We report here the capacity of three analogs of Splenopentin, to up regulate transcription of the HLA-B7 gene in the K562 cell line. These cells normally do not transcribe the HLA class I genes. The Splenopentin analogs used in this study are effective at very low molar concentrations and are non-toxic to cells at these levels. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift assays indicate that this transcriptional up regulation of HLA class I genes may be related to the appearance of novel class I promoter binding factors induced in the nuclei of treated cells.	0

9427093	Relation between premorbid personality and patterns of emotion expression in mid- to late-stage dementia. Twenty-seven nursing home patients with mid- to late-stage dementia participated in a study of the relation between preillness personality, as indexed by attachment and emotion regulation style, and current emotional behavior. Preillness measures were completed by family members and current assessments of emotion were supplied by nursing home aides and family members; in addition, emotion was coded during a family visit using an objective coding system for facial emotion expressions. Attachment style was found to be related to the expression of positive affect, with securely attached individuals displaying more positive affect than avoidantly attached individuals. In addition, high ratings on premorbid hostility were associated with higher rates of negative affect and lower rates of positive affect. These findings indicate that premorbid aspects of personality show continuity over time, even in mid- to late-stage dementia.	0

8606211	Reimplantation of an infected, abdominally implanted defibrillator in the subpectoral region. This report regards a 55-year-old patient with an abdominally implanted, nonthoracotomy, cardioverter defibrillator system (Medtronic PCD 7217B) due to recurrent ventricular tachycardia and survived sudden cardiac death. Fifteen months after defibrillator implantation clinical signs of system infection occurred. The defibrillator and the two leads (Medtronic 6963 and 6966) were removed and treatment with intravenous antibiotic therapy was started. Thereafter the original resterilized ICD was re-implanted in a right subpectoral position with new right ventricular-and superior vena cava leads. This report shows that reuse of the relatively large Medtronic PCD 7217B with a new transvenous lead system in a retropectoral location is feasible and economically beneficial with regard to the high device cost.	0
14505401	Voltammetry of the phase transfer of polypeptide protamines across polarized liquid/liquid interfaces. Using natural polypeptide protamines as the illustrating example, we observed the phase transfer of biological polyions at polarized interfaces between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) for the first time by micropipet voltammetry. Analysis of the limiting currents indicates that each protamine carries 20 positive charges as expected from the number of arginine residues in the molecule. Also, it was shown that the shape of the voltammograms is limited by the interfacial transfer of protamines. Coupling of the transfer reactions with interfacial adsorption/desorption of protamines was also observed. ITIES will serve as a basis of amperometric sensors for biological macromolecules and also as a model for understanding potential-driven membrane transport of these molecules.	0
6878038	Preferential binding of the chemical carcinogen N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene to B-DNA as compared to Z-DNA. The reaction between the chemical carcinogen N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene and poly (dG-dC) . poly (dG-dC) (B-form), poly (dG-m5dC) . poly (dG-m5dC) (B-or Z-form), poly(dG-br5dC) . poly (dG-br5dC) (Z-form) has been studied. The carcinogen binds covalently to B-DNA but does not bind significantly to Z-DNA. These results are discussed as related to the accessibility, the electrostatic potential and the dynamic structure of DNA. The accessibility and the electrostatic potential of DNA do not explain the difference in reactivity of the carcinogen since a related carcinogen N-acetoxy-N-acetyl-2-aminofluorene binds equally well to both B and Z-DNA. On the other hand, poly (dG-dC) . poly(dG-dC) and poly (dG-br5dC) . poly(dG-br5dC), in presence of ethidium bromide binds equally well to N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene. It is suggested that the very low binding of this carcinogen to Z-DNA as compared to B-DNA is due to differences in the dynamic structures of these two forms of DNA.	0
12738797	Serotonin is a novel survival factor of cardiomyocytes: mitochondria as a target of 5-HT2B receptor signaling. Identification of factors regulating cardiomyocyte survival and growth is important to understand the pathogenesis of congenital heart diseases. Little is known about the molecular mechanism of cardiac functions triggered by serotonin. The link between signaling circuitry of external stimuli and the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery is of wide interest in cardiac diseases. Using cultured cardiomyocytes and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2B-receptor knockout mice as an animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy, for the first time we show that serotonin via the Gq-coupled 5-HT2B-receptor protect cardiomyocytes against serum deprivation-induced apoptosis as manifested by DNA fragmentation, nuclear chromatin condensation, and TUNEL labeling. Serotonin prevents cytochrome c release and caspase-9 and -3 activation after serum deprivation via cross-talks between phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling pathways. Serotonin binding to 5-HT2B-receptor activates ERK kinases to inhibit Bax expression induced by serum deprivation. Serotonin via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt can activate NF-kappaB that is required for the regulation of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT-1). Parallel to these observations, ultrastructural analysis in the 5-HT2B-receptor knockout mice heart revealed pronounced mitochondrial defects in addition to altered mitochondrial enzyme activities (cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase) and ANT-1 and Bax expressions. These findings identify 5-HT as a novel survival factor targeting mitochondria in cardiomyocytes.	0
23891539	A review of current knowledge on toxic benthic freshwater cyanobacteria--ecology, toxin production and risk management. Benthic cyanobacteria are found globally in plethora of environments. Although they have received less attention than their planktonic freshwater counterparts, it is now well established that they produce toxins and reports of their involvement in animal poisonings have increased markedly during the last decade. Most of the known cyanotoxins have been identified from benthic cyanobacteria including: the hepatotoxic microcystins, nodularins and cylindrospermopsins, the neurotoxic saxitoxins, anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a and dermatotoxins, such as lyngbyatoxin. In most countries, observations of toxic benthic cyanobacteria are fragmented, descriptive and in response to animal toxicosis events. Only a limited number of long-term studies have aimed to understand why benthic proliferations occur, and/or how toxin production is regulated. These studies have shown that benthic cyanobacterial blooms are commonly a mixture of toxic and non-toxic genotypes and that toxin concentrations can be highly variable spatially and temporally. Physiochemical parameters responsible for benthic proliferation vary among habitat type with physical disturbance (e.g., flow regimes, wave action) and nutrients commonly identified as important. As climatic conditions change and anthropogenic pressures on waterways increase, it seems likely that the prevalence of blooms of benthic cyanobacteria will increase. In this article we review current knowledge on benthic cyanobacteria: ecology, toxin-producing species, variables that regulate toxin production and bloom formation, their impact on aquatic and terrestrial organisms and current monitoring and management strategies. We suggest research needs that will assist in filling knowledge gaps and ultimately allow more robust monitoring and management protocols to be developed.	0
22842034	Characterization of chemoselective surface attachment of the cationic peptide melimine and its effects on antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising alternatives to current treatments for bacterial infections. However, our understanding of the structural-functional relationship of tethered AMPs still requires further investigation to establish a general approach for obtaining consistent antimicrobial surfaces. In this study, we have systematically examined the effects of surface orientation of a broad-spectrum synthetic cationic peptide, melimine, on its antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The attachment of melimine to maleimide-functionalized glass was facilitated by addition of a single cysteine amino acid into the peptide sequence at the N-terminus (CysN) or C-terminus (CysC), or at position 13 (Cys13, approximately central). The successful attachment of the modified melimine was monitored using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) with principle component analysis. The ToF-SIMS analysis clearly demonstrated structural difference between the three orientations. The peptide density for the modified surfaces was found to be between 3.5-4.0 10(-9)molcm(-2) using a modified Bradford assay. The ability of the surfaces to resist Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus colonization was compared using fluorescence confocal microscopy. Reductions in total P. aeruginosa and S. aureus adhesion of 70% (p<0.001) and 83% (p<0.001), respectively, after 48h were observed for the melimine samples when compared to the blank control. We found that melimine attached via the N-terminus was the most effective in reducing total bacterial adhesion and bacterial viability with two- and four times (p<0.001) more activity than melimine attached via the C-terminus for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively. Furthermore, for Cys13, despite having the highest measured peptide density of the three surfaces, the higher concentration did not confer the greatest antibacterial effect. This highlights the importance of orientation of the peptides on the surface to efficacy. Our results suggest that the optimal orientation of the cationic residues is essential for maximum surface activity, whereby the optimal activity is obtained when the cationic portion is more available to interact with colonizing bacteria.	0

18678218	[Insulin therapy may hasten congestive heart failure in cardiac patients: case series and review of the literature]. We describe the appearance, within a few weeks from the beginning of insulin therapy, of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure in three diabetic patients with known cardiac disease (one with aortic stenosis, one with hypertensive heart disease and one with ischemic heart disease), who however had never previously shown signs of heart failure. Reduction of the dose of insulin, along with a moderate diuretic therapy, led to resolution of clinical condition. Sodium retention and increased vascular permeability by insulin could be the causes of this phenomenon. In clinical practice it is necessary to remember that the beginning of insulin treatment could exacerbate left ventricular dysfunction to an overt heart failure. Future studies should evaluate whether insulin therapy plays a negative role in the long-term prognosis of patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, as it has already been hypothesized in those with overt heart failure.	0

15999550	Administration of estramustine in response to changes in the prostate-specific antigen and Karnofsky index in the treatment of prostate cancer. Androgen ablation is palliative and does not cure advanced prostate cancer. The hormone-sensitive cells die and the hormone-resistant cells overgrow, resulting in disease progression. The drug of choice for secondary treatment is estramustine (Estracyt). The success of the therapy is followed by changes of the prostate-specific antigen level and Karnofsky scale. In the present study, the results of estramustine treatment of 79 patients with advanced prostate cancer in 12 hospitals were evaluated. The mean prostate-specific antigen level improved for 6 months, but rose from the ninth month on. The improvement in the subjective condition of the patients paralleled the change in the prostate-specific antigen level. The short time of improvement was a consequence of the very high prostate-specific antigen level and the poor general condition. Estramustine administration is recommended when the prostate-specific antigen level becomes more than doubled following primary treatment. At a starting prostate-specific antigen level of > 100 ng/ml, the treatment leads to total androgen blockade. If the prostate-specific antigen level has not decreased after treatment for 3 months, the secondary strategy is to apply chemotherapy.	0
15889739	Effects of sublethal concentrations of Bacillus thuringiensis on larval development of Sesamia nonagrioides. In the Mediterranean Basin, developed diapausing larvae of the borer Sesamia nonagrioides Lef  bvre are found consistently during autumn in transgenic corn, Zea mays L., expressing Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) toxins derived from event 176. These larvae can feed on sublethal concentrations of Bt toxins because the expression of this corn toxin declines after flowering. To evaluate the possible consequences of this phenomenon, the effect of sublethal concentrations of the natural toxin producer, B. thuringiensis variety kurstaki (Dipel DF) on the performance of S. nonagrioides in the laboratory was examined. Larvae treated with Dipel DF showed higher mortality, longer developmental time, extra molts, and higher sensitivity to critical daylength for diapause induction than the untreated larvae. Accordingly, diapausing larvae collected in October and February in a Bt cornfield exhibited a higher number of supernumerary molts before pupating and longer diapause development than larvae collected in a non-Bt field at the same time. These results demonstrate that deployment of Bt corn in the Mediterranean may affect both the borer performance and the development of Bt resistance in addition to direct mortality caused by the Bt toxin.	0

Addition of a-arylmethylidene- or a-alkylidene-b-keto ester enolate to N-activated aldimines via the imino aldol pathway followed by intramolecular aza-Michael reaction in a domino fashion has been developed, and a highly diastereoselective route to substituted piperidines is reported. Enantiopure piperidines are synthesized from chiral sulfinyl imines. Formation and the observed stereoselectivity of the products have been rationalized by mechanistic and computational studies.	0
19482898	Can physical exercise during gestation attenuate the effects of a maternal perinatal low-protein diet on oxygen consumption in rats? A protocol of physical exercise, based on maximal oxygen uptake ((.)V(O2max)), for female rats before and during pregnancy was developed to evaluate the impact of a low-protein diet on oxygen consumption during gestation and growth rate of the offspring. Virgin female Wistar rats were divided into four groups as follows: untrained (NT, n =5); trained (T, n =5); untrained with low-protein diet (NT+LP, n =5); and trained with low-protein diet (T+LP, n =5). Trained rats were submitted to a protocol ofmoderate physical training on a treadmill over a period of 4 weeks (5 days week(-1) and 60 min day(-1), at 65% of (.)V(O2max)). At confirmation of pregnancy, the intensity and duration of the exercise was reduced. Low-protein groups received an 8% casein diet, and their peers received a 17% casein diet. The birthweight and growth rate of the pups up to the 90th day were recorded. Oxygen consumption ((.)V(O2)), CO2 production and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were determined using an indirect open-circuit calorimeter. Exercise training increased (.)V(O2max) by about 20% when compared with the initial values (45.6+/-1.0 ml kg(-1) min(-1)). During gestation, all groups showed a progressive reduction in the resting (.)V(O2) values. Dams in the NT+LP group showed lower values of resting (.)V(O2) than those in the NT group. The growth rate of pups from low-protein-fed mothers was around 50% lower than that of their respective controls. The T group showed an increase in body weight from the 60th day onwards, while the NT+LP group presented a reduced body weight from weaning onwards. In conclusion, physical training attenuated the impact of the low-protein diet on oxygen consumption during gestation and on the growth rate of the offspring.	0

21221872	Proteome profiling of heat shock of human primary breast epithelial cells, a dataset report. Exposure to elevated temperatures has a strong effect on cell functions, and is used in clinical practice. Hyperthermia may affect multiple regulatory mechanisms in cells. To understand better the response to hyperthermia of immortalized primary human breast epithelial cells, we performed a proteomics study of these cells cultured at 34  C or 39  C. Twenty-four proteins were shown to be differentially expressed due to hyperthermia. Analysis of these proteins showed the potential involvement of various biological processes in response to hyperthermia, e.g., cell adhesion, cell communication, and cell cycle. Transforming growth factor-b2 (TGF-b2) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) were found to be upregulated at 39  C. TGF-b2 was found to affect expression of HSP27, and to have a protective role in hyperthermia-induced cell death. Thus, the dataset described here of hyperthermia-related proteins in human primary breast epithelial cells predicts a number of cellular activities affected by exposure to high temperatures and provides a set of proteins for further studies.	0

18003150	Ellipsoid-constrained robust fitting of quadrics with application to the 3D morphological characterization of articular surfaces. This paper addresses the ellipsoid-type-specified fitting of quadratic surfaces, in the scope of model-based global feature extraction within scattered 3D point clouds. At characterizing articular bone surfaces, the quadrics estimated indicate useful overall-symmetry-related intrinsic centers and axes in joints. A constrained weighted least-squares minimization of algebraic residuals is used, with a robust and bias-corrected metric. With only one quadratic constraint involved, every step produces closed-form eigenvector solutions. To guarantee that an ellipsoid is output, we originally exploit a 2D representation called the Quadric Shape Map (QSM) by carrying out a visual study of the influence of shape constraints. The identified ellipsoid guarantee is needed to extract the center and axes in a wrist joint data stemming from 3D medical images.	0

14764653	Activin regulation of the follicle-stimulating hormone beta-subunit gene involves Smads and the TALE homeodomain proteins Pbx1 and Prep1. FSH is critical for normal reproductive function in both males and females. Activin, a member of the TGFbeta family of growth factors, is an important regulator of FSH expression, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms through which it acts. We used transient transfections into the immortalized gonadotrope cell line LbetaT2 to identify three regions (at -973/-962, -167, and -134) of the ovine FSH beta-subunit gene that are required for full activin response. All three regions contain homology to consensus binding sites for Smad proteins, the intracellular mediators of TGFbeta family signaling. Mutation of the distal site reduces activin responsiveness, whereas mutation of either proximal site profoundly disrupts activin regulation of the FSHbeta gene. These sites specifically bind LbetaT2 nuclear proteins in EMSAs, and the -973/-962 site binds Smad4 protein. Interestingly, the protein complex binding to the -134 site contains Smad4 in association with the homeodomain proteins Pbx1 and Prep1. Using glutathione S-transferase interaction assays, we demonstrate that Pbx1 and Prep1 interact with Smads 2 and 3 as well. The two proximal activin response elements are well conserved across species, and Pbx1 and Prep1 proteins bind to the mouse gene in vivo. Furthermore, mutation of either proximal site abrogates activin responsiveness of a mouse FSHbeta reporter gene as well, confirming their functional conservation. Our studies provide a basis for understanding activin regulation of FSHbeta gene expression and identify Pbx1 and Prep1 as Smad partners and novel mediators of activin action.	1

23901738	[Can exposure to light drive you crazy?]. Scientific research efforts have elucidated the mechanisms with which light exposure to the eyes influences the functions of the body. These reports have also provided information about the importance of light exposures in terms of health. Individuals with mood disorder in particular experience the seasonal changes in general wellbeing. Seasonal variation in mood and behavior is a complex phenotype, to which the photoperiod and ambient temperatures over the day and across the year contribute. Therefore, to evaluate, whether exposure to light can drive you mad, is not a simple task.	0
10924842	Variable bone mass recovery in hyperthyroid bone disease after radioiodine therapy in postmenopausal patients. OBJECTIVES: Long-term follow-up of postmenopausal hyperthyroid females after radioiodine therapy, since hyperthyroidism is known to cause impressive bone loss which may increase the risk of bone fractures. METHODS: Bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical parameters of bone metabolism in hyperthyroid postmenopausal patients were investigated before and 2 years after radioiodine therapy and compared with euthyroid age-matched controls. RESULTS: At baseline, the incidence of low BMD with t-scores more than 2.5 S.D. below normal was significantly higher in hyperthyroid patients (54%) than in controls (20%, P<0.001). Regardless of initial BMD values, osteocalcin (OC) was also higher in all hyperthyroid patients (P<0.0001). After 2 years, all treated patients were euthyroid and OC levels were in the upper normal range. In hyperthyroid patients with initially low BMD, bone density values had increased significantly by +6.5% (P<0.008) as compared with baseline values. In contrast, hyperthyroid patients with initially normal BMD showed a further decrease in lumbar BMD values of -4.3% despite radioiodine treatment. BMD in euthyroid controls decreased by -6.5% within 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that hyperthyroid postmenopausal patients with generally increased bone turnover may show individual differences in bone loss and BMD recovery after radioiodine treatment. The mechanisms for this variable manifestation of osteoporosis have still to be elucidated, since this has implications for prophylactic and therapeutic strategies in these elderly patients.	0
6704011	Improving the therapeutic index of topically applied ocular drugs. Nasolacrimal occlusion (NLO) and eyelid closure are simple techniques that not only increase the ocular bioavailability of topically applied ocular drugs but also reduce the probability of adverse systemic effects. Each serves to improve the therapeutic index. Subsequent to the application of 0.5% timolol maleate, the effects of NLO and eyelid closure were compared with the effects of no procedures. In this experiment, systemic drug absorption in normal volunteers was reduced more than 60%. Measurements were made by radioimmunoassay of timolol in blood plasma. In addition, the diminution of fluorescein in the anterior chamber was observed for three hours following direct application to the lower cul-de-sac. Results indicate a lower fluorescein concentration and a shorter duration of fluorescence in the absence of either experimental technique. Both NLO and eyelid closure seem to be safe, simple, and effective procedures that could minimize dosage requirements, as well as side effects.	0

24315072	Brazilians have different views on when abortion should be legal, but most do not agree with imprisoning women for abortion. Unsafe abortions remain a major public health problem in countries with very restrictive abortion laws. In Brazil, parliamentarians - who have the power to change the law - are influenced by \"public opinion\", often obtained through surveys and opinion polls. This paper presents the findings from two studies. One was carried out in February-December 2010 among 1,660 public servants and the other in February-July 2011 with 874 medical students from three medical schools, both in S  o Paulo State, Brazil. Both groups of respondents were asked two sets of questions to obtain their opinion about abortion: 1) under which circumstances abortion should be permitted by law, and 2) whether or not women in general and women they knew who had had an abortion should be punished with prison, as Brazilian law mandates. The differences in their answers were enormous: the majority of respondents were against putting women who have had abortions in prison. Almost 60% of civil servants and 25% of medical students knew at least one woman who had had an illegal abortion; 85% of medical students and 83% of civil servants thought this person(s) should not be jailed. Brazilian parliamentarians who are currently reviewing a reform in the Penal Code need to have this information urgently.	0

22563006	Early sensory-perceptual processing deficits for affectively valenced inputs are more pronounced in schizophrenia patients with a history of violence than in their non-violent peers. Individuals with schizophrenia are more prone to violent behaviors than the general population. It is increasingly recognized that processing of emotionally valenced stimuli is impaired in schizophrenia, a deficit that may play a role in aggressive behavior. Our goal was to establish whether patients with a history of violence would show more severe deficits in processing emotionally valenced inputs than non-violent patients. Using event-related potentials, we measured how early during processing of emotional valence, evidence of aberrant function was observed. A total of 42 schizophrenia patients (21 with history of violence; 21 without) and 28 healthy controls were tested. Participants performed an inhibitory control task, making speeded responses to pictorial stimuli. Pictures occasionally repeated twice and participants withheld responses to these repeats. Valenced pictures from the International Affective Picture System were presented. Results in controls showed modulations during the earliest phases of sensory processing (<100   ms) for negatively valenced pictures. A cascade of modulations ensued, involving sensory and perceptual processing stages. In contrast, neither schizophrenia group showed early differentiation. Non-violent patients showed earliest modulations beginning    150   ms. For violent patients, however, earliest modulations were further delayed and highly attenuated. The current study reveals sensory-perceptual processing dysfunction for negatively valenced inputs, which is particularly pronounced in aggressive patients.	0
7502700	Several anesthetics, but not diethyl ether, cause marked elevation of serum parathyroid hormone concentration in rats. The effects of anesthetics on serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were determined by a new homologous two-site immunoradiometric assay for rat PTH. Serum PTH concentrations (mean +/- SE) from ether-anesthetized rats (14.7 +/- 1.5 pg/ml, n = 22) were not significantly different from those of decapitated unanesthetized female rats (13.0 +/- 1.8 pg/ml, n = 21). Serum PTH concentrations in pg/ml (n = 4-14) for other anesthetics tested were: ketamine, 12.5 +/- 1.1; Na pentobarbital, 23.3 +/- 2.4; methoxyflurane (inhalation), 42.2 +/- 6.8; and xylazine combined with ketamine, 51.4 +/- 11.3 pg/ml. The latter two concentrations were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than the values for all other anesthetics and decapitation. Elevation of serum PTH induced by pentobarbital or ketamine + xylazine increased with time under anesthesia. Neither serum Ca2+ concentrations nor pH differed among any of the groups. We conclude that anesthesia induced by pentobarbital, methoxyflurane, or ketamine + xylazine in rats leads to a marked elevation of serum PTH levels that appears to be related to the duration of anesthesia and not due to any measurable fall in serum Ca2+.	0

9306051	Pharmacological importance of stereochemical resolution of enantiomeric drugs. Drug enantiomers have identical properties in an achiral environment, but should be considered as different chemical compounds. This is because they often differ considerably in potency, pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetic profile, since the modules with which they interact in biological systems are also optically active. Within biological systems, the metabolism of one isomer may be via a different pathway or occur at a different rate from that of the other isomer. Preferential binding of one isomer to plasma proteins may cause differences in circulating free drug and hence alter concentrations at active sites. Interactions of both isomers may differ at the active sites through which pharmacological action is mediated. Actions and levels of activity of the stereoisomers in vivo may also differ. All the pharmacological activity may reside in a single enantiomer, whereas several possibilities exist for the other enantiomer-- it may be inactive, have a qualitatively different effect, an antagonistic effect or produce greater toxicity. Two isomers may have nearly identical qualitative pharmacological activity, qualitatively similar pharmacological activity but quantitatively different potency, or qualitatively different pharmacological activity. To avoid adverse effects and optimise the therapeutic value of enantiomeric drugs, it is necessary that methods for the resolution of racemates be evolved and devolved to determine isomeric purity, establish the effectiveness of isomers of the drug, and detect the presence of an enantiomer with lower therapeutic activity and undesirable adverse effects. Even if a drug is given as a pure enantiomer, methods to discriminate between enantiomers are required because racemisation can occur both in vitro and in vivo. Methods developed for resolution of drug enantiomers should facilitate routine testing of single isomers and their metabolites, studies of pharmacological, toxicological and clinical effectiveness, routine analysis of racemates, pure enantiomers or intermediates in manufacturing processes, and investigation of the potential for inversion of an enantiopure drug substance during the early stages of drug development and therapeutic drug monitoring.	0

20429793	Adverse events following infusion of T cells for adoptive immunotherapy: a 10-year experience. BACKGROUND AIMS: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently recommends at least 4 h of recipient monitoring after T cell infusions to detect early infusion reactions. Recent catastrophic reactions to 'first-in-man' biologic agents have emphasized the importance of this rule for initial studies of new products. The value of such monitoring for better established agents is less obvious. METHODS: We reviewed infusion-related adverse events (AE) following administration of ex vivo-expanded T cell products (antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allodepleted T cells, and genetically modified T cells) on investigational new drug (IND) studies in our center. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2008, we infused 381 T cell products to 180 recipients, enrolled on 18 studies, receiving T cells targeting malignancies or post-transplant viral infections. There were no grade 3-4 infusion reactions during initial monitoring or 24-h follow-up. Twenty-four mild (grade 1-2) AE occurred in 21 infusions either during or immediately following infusion (up to 6 h), most commonly nausea and vomiting (10/24, 41.6%), probably because of the dimethyl sulfoxide cryoprotectant, and hypotension (20.8%), attributable to diphenhydramine pre-medication. Twenty-two additional non-severe events were reported within 24 h of infusion, most commonly culture-negative fever, chills and nausea. An increased risk of adverse events was associated with age [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.00, P = 0.05], while an increased risk of immediate infusion-related events was higher in patients reporting allergies (IRR 2.72, 95% CI 1.00-7.40, P = 0.05); sex, disease type and T cell source (allogeneic or autologous) had no effect on frequency of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Infusion of these T cell products was safe in the outpatient setting and associated with no severe reactions, so monitoring for 1 h after infusion is probably sufficient. As many of the AE were attributable to diphenhydramine premedication, a lower dose (0.25 mg/kg) should be selected.	0
20228173	Chemerin exacerbates glucose intolerance in mouse models of obesity and diabetes. Obesity, characterized by an excess of adipose tissue, is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Different mechanisms linking obesity with these comorbidities have been postulated but remain poorly understood. Adipose tissue secretes a number of hormone-like compounds, termed adipokines, that are important for the maintenance of normal glucose metabolism. Alterations in the secretion of adipokines with obesity are believed to contribute to the undesirable changes in glucose metabolism that ultimately result in the development of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we have shown that serum levels of the novel adipokine chemerin are significantly elevated in mouse models of obesity/diabetes. The expression of chemerin and its receptors, chemokine-like receptor 1, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor-like 2, and G protein-coupled receptor 1 are altered in white adipose, skeletal muscle, and liver tissue of obese/diabetic mice. Administration of exogenous chemerin exacerbates glucose intolerance, lowers serum insulin levels, and decreases tissue glucose uptake in obese/diabetic but not normoglycemic mice. Collectively, these data indicate that chemerin influences glucose homeostasis and may contribute to the metabolic derangements characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes.	0

8370387	A possible role of two hydrophobic amino acids in antigen recognition by synovial T cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial T cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovitis. We have quantitatively analyzed the T cell receptor (TcR) variable (V) region gene repertoire of freshly isolated synovial fluid (SF) T cells, comparing it with that of peripheral blood (PB) T cells in RA. The TcR V gene repertoire of PB and SF T cells in RA and osteoarthritis was heterogeneous. In contrast, V alpha 11 in SF was expressed to a greater degree in three of five RA patients, and increased levels of V beta 6, 1-3 were found in the SF of four of six RA, compared with paired PB. Of note, V beta 6, 1-3 was universally used in four RA patients with a disease duration of less than 10 years, irrespective of their HLA-DR types. This was in contrast to two other RA patients, suffering for more than 20 years, who showed different V alpha and V beta usages. beta-chain sequence analysis in RA patients with a preference for V beta 6, 1-3 has shown that a few clones dominated in SF, whereas polyclonality was observed in PB. These findings suggest oligoclonal expansion of T cells in response to specific antigen(s) in the SF of these patients with RA of relatively short duration. Concomitant use of two hydrophobic amino acids, leucine and valine in the D beta region was noticeable among the predominant SF clones. These two amino acids might directly contact a peptide specific for the induction of synovitis in RA patients. TcR-directed therapy may, therefore, be useful for the treatment of early RA synovitis.	0

16156166	Salt fluoridation in France since 1986. In 1985, the production and use of fluoridated salt was authorized in France. Domestic salt both with added fluoride (at 250 ppm) and without fluoride has been on the market since 1986. It was recommended to avoid the consumption of fluoridated salt if the local drinking water contained more than 0.5 milligrams of fluoride per litre. The legislation has never been modified since, except for a few developments such as the permission given to school canteens in 1993 to use fluoridated salt, provided canteen managers made sure that the drinking water contained no more than 0.5 milligrams of fluoride per litre. Epidemiological surveys about fluoridated salt in France are few, but they point in the same direction: decrease of DMFT and DMFS values, evident for the period 1986-1993 but minimal from 1993 to 1998. In 1999 and 2002, epidemiological comparative surveys were carried out in Montpellier (France) and Heidelberg (Germany) among 12-year-old schoolchildren. A decrease in caries prevalence was found in both towns, particulary in Heidelberg. On the other hand, the two cities showed some slight differences resulting from public health policy, from individual preventive habits, and from an earlier introduction of fluoridated salt in France.	0
11448695	Constituents and pH changes in protein rich hyaluronan solution affect the biotribological properties of artificial articular joints. The relationship between the coefficient of friction and pH value or protein constituents of lubricating fluid, together with viscosity, were studied within a bearing surface model for artificial joint, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) against stainless steel (SUS), using a mechanical spectrometer. Four lubricants were tested in this study: sodium hyaluronate (HA), HA with albumin, HA with gamma-globulin, and HA with (L)alpha-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ((L)alpha-DPPC). The coefficient of friction between UHMWPE and SUS in HA with albumin or HA with gamma-globulin varied from 0.035 to 0.070 depending on angular velocity and pH. The coefficient of friction in HA or HA with (L)alpha-DPPC varied from 0.023 to 0.045 depending on angular velocity and pH. The variation in pH for HA with albumin had a large effect on the coefficient of friction at low range of angular velocity with viscosity independence. The variation in pH for HA with gamma-globulin had a large effect on the coefficient of friction with viscosity dependence at high angular velocity. The addition of (L)alpha-DPPC showed a small effect on the coefficient of friction at low angular velocity. This study confirms that the presence of albumin in the lubricant promotes pH dependence and viscosity independence of the tribological properties at low speed while the presence of globulin promotes pH and viscosity independence at low speed and promotes pH and viscosity dependence at high speed in the lubrication of UHMWPE against SUS. This study supports the clinical hypothesis that the effect of constituents and pH changes in periprosthetic fluid for the lubrication is a clue toward resolving many complications after total joint replacement.	0
22953932	Caseinolytic and milk-clotting activities from Moringa oleifera flowers. This work reports the detection and characterization of caseinolytic and milk-clotting activities from Moringa oleifera flowers. Proteins extracted from flowers were precipitated with 60% ammonium sulphate. Caseinolytic activity of the precipitated protein fraction (PP) was assessed using azocasein, as well as a(s)-, b- and k-caseins as substrates. Milk-clotting activity was analysed using skim milk. The effects of heating (30-100  C) and pH (3.0-11.0) on enzyme activities were determined. Highest caseinolytic activity on azocasein was detected after previous incubation of PP at pH 4.0 and after heating at 50  C. Milk-clotting activity, detected only in the presence of CaCl(2), was highest at incubation of PP at pH 3.0 and remained stable up to 50  C. The pre-treatment of milk at 70  C resulted in highest clotting activity. Enzyme assays in presence of protease inhibitors indicated the presence of aspartic, cysteine, serine and metallo proteases. Aspartic proteases appear to be the main enzymes involved in milk-clotting activity. PP promoted extensive cleavage of k-casein and low level of a(s)- and b-caseins hydrolysis. The milk-clotting activity indicates the application of M. oleifera flowers in dairy industry.	0

10937444	Patent ductus arteriousus in the premature neonate: current concepts in pharmacological management. In utero, the ductus arteriosus shunts deoxygenated blood away from the pulmonary artery and towards the placental circulation where foetal gas exchange occurs. As a result of an intricately intertwined network of both physiological and biochemical changes, this vessel constricts rapidly after birth. Deoxygenated blood is diverted away from the placenta and through the lungs now vital for gas exchange. Premature closure of the ductus in utero can cause pulmonary hypertension and even death. Conversely, failure to close after birth can exacerbate respiratory distress, precipitate congestive heart failure and increase the risk of subsequent intestinal ischaemia leading to necrotising enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, renal hypoperfusion and/or cerebral ischaemia. In this review we summarise current knowledge of the delicately orchestrated control of the ductus arteriosus, focusing on the role of cyclo-oxygenase isoforms on prostaglandin production, on the interaction between prostaglandins and oxygen, and on the effects of these on ductal patency. We also seek to describe some of the standard and nonstandard therapeutic approaches available to the clinician when natural closure fails, reviewing alternative protocols for indomethacin administration and comparing indomethacin treatment with newer approaches such as ibuprofen. In summary, we will follow the course of this unique blood vessel as it is transformed over several hours from an organ absolutely vital to survival into programmed obsolescence.	0

16253375	Mobility of model proteins in hydrogels composed of oppositely charged dextran microspheres studied by protein release and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. In this paper, the release of proteins from a novel self-gelling hydrogel based on biodegradable dextran microspheres is investigated. The protein-loaded macroscopic gels are obtained by hydration of mixtures of oppositely charged hydroxyethyl methacrylate-derivatized dextran microspheres with a protein solution. In media of low ionic strength (100 mM Hepes pH 7.0) it was found that the release of the entrapped model proteins (lysozyme, BSA and IgG) was slower than in saline (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Hepes pH 7.0). The reason behind this observation is that substantial adsorption of the proteins onto the microspheres' surface and/or absorption in the microspheres takes place. Confocal images showed that independent of their crosslink density the microspheres are impermeable for BSA and IgG. BSA, bearing a negative charge at neutral pH, was adsorbed onto the surface of positively charged microspheres. Lysozyme, which is positively charged at neutral pH, was able to penetrate into the negatively charged microspheres. In saline, the gels showed continuous release of the different proteins for 25 to 60 days. Importantly, lysozyme was quantitatively and with full preservation of its enzymatic activity released in about 25 days. This emphasizes the protein friendly technology to prepare the protein-loaded gels. Mathematical modeling revealed that protein release followed Fick's second law, indicating that the systems are primarily diffusion controlled. These results show that these hydrogels are very suitable as injectable matrix for diffusion-controlled delivery of pharmaceutically active proteins.	0
11552450	[Molecular pathology: applications of molecular biology in pathological anatomy]. The rapid development of molecular biology techniques as well as recent progress in the understanding of genetic and molecular basis of human diseases have had enormous impact in the practice of clinical pathology. Since new diagnostic (molecular) tools are now available, the concept of Molecular Pathology is emerging. Molecular Pathology is defined by the use of molecular biology techniques and the type of specimens that are involved in its practice, basically ARN and ADN, extracted from cytological and tissue specimens. Although most methods used in molecular pathology and their applications are still under investigation and clinical validation they have great potential in several areas of pathological diagnosis, particularly on infectious and neoplastic diseases. Introduction of these techniques in pathology laboratories in our country should significantly enhance the diagnostic and research skills in the field.	0

17553105	High-lysine corn generated by endosperm-specific suppression of lysine catabolism using RNAi. Because of the limited lysine content in corn grain, synthetic lysine supplements are added to corn meal-based rations for animal feed. The development of biotechnology, combined with the understanding of plant lysine metabolism, provides an alternative solution for increasing corn lysine content through genetic engineering. Here, we report that by suppressing lysine catabolism, transgenic maize kernels accumulated a significant amount of lysine. This was achieved by RNA interference (RNAi) through the endosperm-specific expression of an inverted-repeat (IR) sequence targeting the maize bifunctional lysine degradation enzyme, lysine-ketoglutarate reductase/saccharopine dehydrogenase (ZLKR/SDH). Although plant-short interfering RNA (siRNA) were reported to lack tissue specificity due to systemic spreading, we confirmed that the suppression of ZLKR/SDH in developing transgenic kernels was restricted to endosperm tissue. Furthermore, results from our cloning and sequencing of siRNA suggested the absence of transitive RNAi. These results support the practical use of RNAi for plant genetic engineering to specifically target gene suppression in desired tissues without eliciting systemic spreading and the transitive nature of plant RNAi silencing.	0
21274077	Cancer in Canada: an epidemiological perspective. The incidence of cancer has risen steadily over the past 20 years, with a percentage increase per year of 1.3 in males and 0.5 in females. In 1980 the incidence was 333 per 100,000 in males and 259 per 100,000 in females. Over age 45, the incidence of cancers of the larynx and lung increased in both sexes, as did that of cancer of the prostate in males. The incidence of melanoma and other skin cancer is also rising in both sexes. Although the incidence of cervical cancer among women aged 35 and over fell during the decade 1970-80, the incidence among younger women increased. The trends over time and the regional differences in incidence are generally in keeping with what is known (and what is not known) about the etiology of cancer.	0

10908641	Distribution and abundance of microsatellites in the yeast genome can Be explained by a balance between slippage events and point mutations. We fit a Markov chain model of microsatellite evolution introduced by Kruglyak et al. to data on all di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats in the yeast genome. Our results suggest that many features of the distribution of abundance and length of microsatellites can be explained by this simple model, which incorporates a competition between slippage events and base pair substitutions, with no need to invoke selection or constraints on the lengths. Our results provide some new information on slippage rates for individual repeat motifs, which suggest that AT-rich trinucleotide repeats have higher slippage rates. As our model predicts, we found that many repeats were adjacent to shorter repeats of the same motif. However, we also found a significant tendency of microsatellites of different motifs to cluster.	0
17016652	Involvement of RHO GTPases and ERK in synuclein-gamma enhanced cancer cell motility. Synuclein-gamma is aberrantly expressed in more than 70% of stage III/IV breast and ovarian carcinomas. Ectopic overexpression of synuclein-gamma enhanced MDA-MB-435 cell migration in vitro and metastasis in a nude mouse model. However, the mechanism of how synuclein-gamma promotes cell motility is not clear. In our previous studies, we showed that synuclein-gamma overexpression activates ERK. In the present study, we overexpressed synuclein-gamma in several breast and ovarian cancer cell lines and evaluated the effect of synuclein-gamma on the activity of small G-protein RHO family members. We found that at least one of the RHO/RAC/CDC42 GTPases showed a higher level of the GTP-bound active form. Consistent with their role in regulating the intracellular motile machinery, inhibition of the RHO/RAC/CDC42 by C. difficile Toxin B blocked cell migration in both parental cells and synuclein-gamma overexpressing cells. The ERK inhibitor U0126 also blocked the cell migration in both parental cells and synuclein-gamma overexpressing cells. Collectively, our data indicate that synuclein-gamma might be involved in late stage breast and ovarian cancer metastasis by enhancing cell motility through activation of the RHO family small-GTPases and ERK.	0

Angiogenesis is a physiological process that allows the formation of new blood vessels, either from the local vascular structures, or from circulating endothelial progenitor cells, mobilized from the bone marrow, and attracted to the neovascularization site. This mechanism is controlled by pro-angiogenic molecules. It is crucial to supply oxygen and nutrients to tissues during growth, embryonic development or tissue regeneration in response to injuries. Thus, the dermis part of the skin is highly vascularized by a dense network of small and medium arteries and of capillaries and venules. In case of injury, rapid tissue repair is possible through this vascular network. However, once the vascularization is restored in tissue repair, the process of angiogenesis is negatively regulated by anti-angiogenic molecules. Controling the balance between pro-and anti-angiogenic agents is crucial and its deregulation leads to serious disease. The extracellular matrix plays an important role in controlling angiogenesis, allowing at least, the distribution of growth factors and the regulation of endothelial cell migration. Among these matrix components, hyaluronic acid plays a major role in the mechanical properties of connective tissues in ensuring their hydration. This glycosaminoglycan is a large size polymer, whose breakdown products strongly act on angiogenesis, especially in pathological situations (cancer, inflammation). Regarding its biological and mechanical properties, hyaluronic acid is used as matrix in tissue engineering, for improving the revascularization of tissues like skin.	0
20500000	Approximating stochastic biochemical processes with Wasserstein pseudometrics. Modelling stochastic processes inside the cell is difficult due to the size and complexity of the processes being investigated. As a result, new approaches are needed to address the problems of model reduction, parameter estimation, model comparison and model invalidation. Here, the authors propose addressing these problems by using Wasserstein pseudometrics to quantify the differences between processes. The method the authors propose is applicable to any bounded continuous-time stochastic process and pseudometrics between processes are defined only in terms of the available outputs. Algorithms for approximating Wasserstein pseudometrics are developed from experimental or simulation data and demonstrate how to optimise parameter values to minimise the pseudometrics. The approach is illustrated with studies of a stochastic toggle switch and of stochastic gene expression in E. coli.	0
7841134	Red blood cell membrane dynamics in schizophrenia. II. Fatty acid composition. Fatty acid compositions were determined in red blood cell (RBC) ghost membranes of schizophrenic patients before and after haloperidol withdrawal, as well as with age-matched normal male control subjects (n = 22). Patients on haloperidol (HD) received treatment in doses between 5 and 20 mg/day for at least 5 weeks (n = 24). Drug-free patients (n = 19) were free of all psychotropic medications for an average of 40 days. A highly significant decrease in the levels (nmol/ml packed RBC) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly 18:2(n - 6) and 20:4(n - 6), was found in both HD-treated and drug-free patients. This decrease remained in those patients who had withdrawn from HD for more than 5 weeks (n = 10). Concomitantly, the percentage of saturated and monoenoic fatty acids to total fatty acids increased significantly in schizophrenic patients. The resultant fatty acid profile consequently lowers the unsaturation index (UI), which represents the average number of double bonds per fatty acid molecule, in RBC ghost membranes of schizophrenic patients. Furthermore, the decreases in UI were significantly correlated to the increases in \"structure order\" of RBC ghost membranes as measured by the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (rs) in normal control and drug-free schizophrenic subjects. Therefore, it is likely that decreased levels of PUFAs in schizophrenic patients might result from a defective uptake of 18:2(n - 6) into RBC membrane phospholipids. Since fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids affects the relative degree of membrane fluidity, the present results lend further support that RBC membrane dynamics are altered in schizophrenia.	0

22163366	Rapid and highly sensitive protein extraction via cobalt oxide nanoparticle-based liquid-liquid microextraction coupled with MALDI mass spectrometry. A new approach for rapid and highly sensitive protein extraction using cobalt oxide nanoparticles modified with cetyltrimethylammonium (Co(3)O(4)/CTA(+) NP) using nanoparticle-based liquid-liquid microextraction (NP-LLME) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has been successfully demonstrated. For the first time, the metal oxide NPs (Co(3)O(4)/CTA(+) NP) prepared in the organic phase (toluene) have been successfully applied for the extraction and preconcentration of proteins from sample solutions and complex samples via electrostatic forces involved between the metal oxide NP and proteins. Lysozyme was used as the model protein to investigate the optimal extraction parameters of the current approach. The optimal conditions were obtained at pH > pI for 10 min of incubation time (extraction time) with 3% salt (NaCl) addition. The Co(3)O(4)/CTA(+) NP was successfully applied for the highly sensitive analysis of an array proteins such as insulin, chymotrypsinogen and lysozyme from aqueous solution, protein mixture and milk samples in nanoparticle-based liquid-phase microextraction coupled with MALDI-MS. The potentiality of the NP-LLME using Co(3)O(4)/CTA(+) NP for the extraction of proteins was also compared with other types of NP-liquid phase microextraction (LPME) methods. The current approach offers distinct advantages including rapidity, straightforwardness, high sensitivity for washing- and separation-free MALDI-MS analysis of proteins.	0
15850135	Comparison of the amelioration effects of two enzyme inducers on the inflammatory process of experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) using immunohistochemical technique. Experimental Allergic Encephalitis (EAE) is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease, which resembles the human disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in rodents. The infiltration of inflammatory cells and the induction of astrocyte proliferation correlate with EAE severity. Oxidative stress is postulated to have a role in the onset and progression of MS. Therefore, by reducing oxidative stress via phase II enzymes inducers; namely the butylhydroxyanisole (BHA) and Thymoquinone (glutathione inducer), the inflammation could be ameliorated. EAE was induced in Lewis rats using Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Animals were placed into 1. those on normal rat chow, 2. those on rat chow containing BHA, 3. those receiving concomitant five day injection of thymoquinone days 1-5 post-EAE induction, 4. those receiving five doses of thymoquinone injected at day 12-17 post-EAE induction. Twenty-nine days later, animals from each group were sacrificed and tissues collected for immunohistochemistry using the anti-glial fibrillary acid (GFAP) antibody to examine the amelioration effect these two agents have on the inflammatory process occurring in EAE by examining the astrocyte proliferation in the Central Nervous System (CNS).	0
17556861	Acquired prolactin deficiency in patients with disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Acquired PRL deficiency occurs when the anterior pituitary is functionally destroyed, and it usually accompanies other pituitary hormone deficiencies. We retrospectively investigated in an outpatient endocrine clinic of a major tertiary medical center the prevalence and clinical characteristics of acquired PRL deficiency in patients with diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The study included 100 consecutive patients, 61 men and 39 women, aged 4-79 yr at diagnosis. Patients were divided by PRL level to normal (>5 ng/ml), mild (3-5 ng/ml), and severe deficiency (<3 ng/ml). Twenty-seven patients (27%) had PRL deficiency, 13 mild deficiency and 14 severe deficiency. Patients with severe PRL deficiency tend to be younger at diagnosis (mean age, 37.5+/-21.8 yr) than patients with normal PRL (46+/-18.5 yr; ns). Underlying diseases including pituitary apoplexy, non-functioning pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, and idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were associated with PRL deficiency. The incidence of severe PRL deficiency rose with an increase in the number of other pituitary hormone deficits (ACTH, TSH, gonadotropin, vasopressin), from 0 in patients with no other deficits to 38% in patients with 4 deficits (p=0.006). Patients with severe deficiency had a mean of 3 hormone deficits compared to 1.8 in the other groups (p=0.006). PRL deficiency was significantly associated with TSH, ACTH and GH deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: PRL deficiency is common in patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, especially pituitary apoplexy and craniopharyngioma. Acquired severe PRL deficiency can be considered a marker for extensive pituitary damage and a more severe degree of hypopituitarism.	0

12280378	[The role of the state in the migration of workers and economic diversification in the countries of the Arab Peninsula]. This work argues that analyses of the contribution of foreign workers to economic diversification of the Gulf states should begin with a study of the structure of petroleum income and the social relations of each country. This hypothesis is in contrast to those which regard the labor market or the low activity rates of Gulf countries as the principle impetus for labor migrations in the Middle East. Although the labor importing countries differ in their degrees of development, size, existing infrastructure, agricultural development, and other key aspects, they have some important features in common. Recourse to foreign labor developed in all the countries during the early 1970s as a result of the increase in petroleum prices. Until the late 1960s, the petroleum producing countries had seen the bulk of the petroleum revenues go to the large oil companies and the consuming countries. The legitimacy of their governments rested on the support of the oil companies and on a system of internal alliances among clans in which the paramount clan redistributed the income receive from the petroleum companies. The redistributed value did not strictly speaking represent the profit but only a fraction of the world petroleum profit divided up by the oil companies. The structure of the state and the relations which attached it to the civil society continue to constitute an effective and durable block to mobilization of an internal labor force. The state, becaue of its relations to the oil companies, had no need of investments. The internal economies of gulf oil producing states were weakly diversified before the 1970s, the state was highly influential, capital as a particular aspect of wealth was poorly developed or undeveloped except in enclaves with foreign capital, internal consumption was largely imported, and no mechanism existed to break the ties of the individual clans or tribes with the state. After 1974 the large oil states undertook a sustained process of productive reallocation of surplus income whose forms depended on their possibilities of insertion in the world economy and their internal social structures. The goal was to transfer a significant fraction of income into capital. The network of alliances put into place by unproductive redistributions cannot be modified without compromising the stability of the state; recourse to foreign manpower in large part is an answer to the inability to disengage local labor. Immigration however appears to be limited by the fact that almost all tensions related to growth find expression in antagonism between nationals and foreign workers. Exportation of capital to the peripheral Arab states with large labor forces does not appear to be a satisfactory solution to the problems of massive labor importation and economic diversification.	0
18066157	Phase-shift error as a result of molecular alignment distortions in a liquid-crystal point-diffraction interferometer. We report the observation of nematic director distortions around the diffracting element of a liquid-crystal point-diffraction interferometer. The observed director field distortions are similar to those reported in the literature for other liquid-crystal guest-host systems. We show how the alignment distortion changes as a function of the voltage applied to the liquid-crystal cell, leading to an observed phase-shift error. Tailoring of surface anchoring conditions and judicious choice of phase-shift algorithm can improve device accuracy.	0

17992349	AIDS by mother-to-child transmission: survival analysis of cases followed from 1983 to 2002 in different regions of Brazil. Antiretroviral therapy contributes to decreasing morbidity and mortality, and ultimately to increasing survival. In Brazil, there are regional differences in HIV epidemiology regarding pregnant women and children with HIV/AIDS. This study evaluates survival time after AIDS diagnosis in 914 children infected by mother-to-child transmission, reported between 1983 and 1998 and followed until 2002, in Brazil's five regions. Time between birth and HIV diagnosis decreased over the years, mainly in the South and Southeast Regions. There was a significant improvement in survival; more than 75% of cases were still living four years after diagnosis in the 1997-1998 group. This Brazilian study demonstrates that even with regional inequalities in health care infrastructure it is possible for a developing country to establish an effective system of universal and free access to antiretroviral therapy that produces a significant increase in survival for children with AIDS.	0

12893597	Community-based participatory research: implications for public health funding. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) increasingly is being recognized by health scholars and funders as a potent approach to collaboratively studying and acting to address health disparities. Emphasizing action as a critical part of the research process, CBPR is particularly consistent with the goals of \"results oriented philanthropy\" and of government funders who have become discouraged by the often modest to disappointing results of more traditional research and intervention efforts in many low income communities of color. Supporters of CBPR face challenging issues in the areas of partnership capacity and readiness, time requirements, funding flexibility, and evaluation. The authors suggest strategies for addressing such issues and make a case for increasing support of CBPR as an important tool for action-oriented and community-driven public health research.	0
10330134	Dimeric RFX proteins contribute to the activity and lineage specificity of the interleukin-5 receptor alpha promoter through activation and repression domains. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) plays a central role in the differentiation, proliferation, and functional activation of eosinophils. The specific action of IL-5 on eosinophils and hematopoietically related basophils is regulated by the restricted expression of IL-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Ralpha), a subunit of high-affinity IL-5R, on these cells. We have previously identified an enhancer-like cis element in the IL-5Ralpha promoter that is important for both full promoter function and lineage-specific activity. Here, we demonstrate by yeast one-hybrid screening that RFX2 protein specifically binds to this cis element. RFX2 belongs to the RFX DNA-binding protein family, the biological role of which remains obscure. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we further show that RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 homodimers and heterodimers specifically bind to the cis element of the IL-5Ralpha promoter. The mRNA expression of RFX1, RFX2, and RFX3 was detected ubiquitously, but in transient-transfection assays, multimerized RFX binding sites in front of a basal promoter efficiently functioned in a tissue- and lineage-specific manner. To further investigate RFX functions on transcription, full-length and deletion mutants of RFX1 were targeted to DNA through fusion to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. Tissue- and lineage-specific transcriptional activation with the full-length RFX1 fusion plasmid on a reporter controlled by GAL4 binding sites was observed. Distinct activation and repression domains within the RFX1 protein were further mapped. Our findings suggest that RFX proteins are transcription factors that contribute to the activity and lineage specificity of the IL-5Ralpha promoter by directly binding to a target cis element and cooperating with other tissue- and lineage-specific cofactors.	1
22125224	To stratify or not to stratify: power considerations for population-based genome-wide association studies of quantitative traits. Meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies require numerous study partners to conduct pre-defined analyses and thus simple but efficient analyses plans. Potential differences between strata (e.g. men and women) are usually ignored, but often the question arises whether stratified analyses help to unravel the genetics of a phenotype or if they unnecessarily increase the burden of analyses. To decide whether to stratify or not to stratify, we compare general analytical power computations for the overall analysis with those of stratified analyses considering quantitative trait analyses and two strata. We also relate the stratification problem to interaction modeling and exemplify theoretical considerations on obesity and renal function genetics. We demonstrate that the overall analyses have better power compared to stratified analyses as long as the signals are pronounced in both strata with consistent effect direction. Stratified analyses are advantageous in the case of signals with zero (or very small) effect in one stratum and for signals with opposite effect direction in the two strata. Applying the joint test for a main SNP effect and SNP-stratum interaction beats both overall and stratified analyses regarding power, but involves more complex models. In summary, we recommend to employ stratified analyses or the joint test to better understand the potential of strata-specific signals with opposite effect direction. Only after systematic genome-wide searches for opposite effect direction loci have been conducted, we will know if such signals exist and to what extent stratified analyses can depict loci that otherwise are missed.	0
12478298	Signal-dependent regulation of splicing via phosphorylation of Sam68. Evolution of human organismal complexity from a relatively small number of genes--only approximately twice that of worm or fly--is explained mainly by mechanisms generating multiple proteins from a single gene, the most prevalent of which is alternative pre-messenger-RNA splicing. Appropriate spatial and temporal generation of splice variants demands that alternative splicing be subject to extensive regulation, similar to transcriptional control. Activation by extracellular cues of several cellular signalling pathways can indeed regulate alternative splicing. Here we address the link between signal transduction and splice regulation. We show that the nuclear RNA-binding protein Sam68 is a new extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) target. It binds exonic splice-regulatory elements of an alternatively spliced exon that is physiologically regulated by the Ras signalling pathway, namely exon v5 of CD44. Forced expression of Sam68 enhanced ERK-mediated inclusion of the v5-exon sequence in mRNA. This enhancement was impaired by mutation of ERK-phosphorylation sites in Sam68, whereas ERK phosphorylation of Sam68 stimulated splicing of the v5 exon in vitro. Finally, Ras-pathway-induced alternative splicing of the endogenous CD44-v5 exon was abolished by suppression of Sam68 expression. Our data define Sam68 as a prototype regulator of alternative splicing whose function depends on protein modification in response to extracellular cues.	0
8712421	Protamine and acute depletion of magnesium limit bone response to parathyroid hormone. The effect of protamine on calcium homeostasis was studied in nine pediatric patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Total serum calcium decreased from 8.44 mg/dL to 7.49 mg/dL (P < 0.05) after protamine. Ionized calcium decreased from 1.39 to 1.31 mmol/L (P < 0.05). A bioassay determined the etiology of this response. Bone disks were placed in sera, protamine, parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone antibody, or magnesium-depleted solutions, then were incubated in solutions with known calcium content. The change in the media's calcium concentration reflects the bone's response to the initial stimulus. Calcium change is expressed as Experimental delta/Control delta (E/C). Normal bone responds to parathyroid hormone, E/C = 0.59 (P < 0.001). Protamine-treated bone loses this response, E/C = 0.9 (P = not significant [NS]). A parathyroid-hormone-induced osteoblast messenger was found. Protamine-treated bone continued to respond to this messenger, E/C = 0.42 (P < 0.001). Bone showed reversible loss of response to parathyroid hormone after incubation in magnesium-free solution, E/C = 0.93 (P = NS). With reincubation in magnesium, E/C = 0.69 (P < 0.01). Since protamine blocks parathyroid receptors, and magnesium depletion limits the bone's response to parathyroid hormone, this may explain the persistent hypocalcemia seen in some patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.	0
12555806	Explanatory variance in bulimia nervosa. In order to prevent disease, one must understand the factors that contribute to the variance of the illness. In an effort to better understand factors that contribute to bulimia nervosa (BN), a study was designed to investigate explanatory factors in BN. Of particular interest to the researchers in the study was the effect of the Hispanic subculture on the variance of BN. Female participants (n = 372) and male participants (n = 109) from the ages of 17-49 agreed to serve in the study. A self-report scale designed to assess the symptoms of BN was the criterion variable in the study. Predictor variables included in the regression model were drive for thinness, body mass index (BMI), age, and ethnicity (Hispanic or Anglo). Separate analyses were run for males and females. Based on the results of the analysis it seems that the desire to be thinner and an individual's BMI contribute to the variance in BN for females, but not for males. There was no difference in the attitudes associated with BN between Hispanic (n = 27) and Anglo (n = 321) females.	0
16308447	Ultrastructural organization of epiphysis in rats under the action of electromagnetic fields and during mammary carcinogenesi. Experiments conducted by the authors, as well as clinical studies, show that in addition to hormonal mis-balance, development of mammary gland cancer is significantly influenced by the action of low frequency electromagnetic fields on epiphysis. By reducing the production of melatonin it increases the risk of development of mammary gland tumors. The review of scientific literature indicates that pinealocytes are the main morphological substrate responsible for functional activity of pineal cells. When estimating large specific weight of lipids, many researchers point to the dependence of their presence in epiphysis on the level of melatonin. It is thought that hormones of pineal cells are deposited in the form of lipid drops. The most characteristic feature in the structure of pinealocytes is the presence of large number of various size complexes in their bodies and appendices. According to many authors this could be the form of depositing the secretory products of pinealocytes, such as melatonin, biological amines, etc. Ultrastructure characteristic of pinealocytes described in the review provides deeper understanding of the fine structure morpho-physiology of epiphysis, enable to point out the peculiarities of its functionality under the influence of electromagnetic fields and discover the organizational structure of pineal body at a time of the mammary gland tumor development.	0

20098560	Practical and clinical considerations in Cobalt-60 tomotherapy. Cobalt-60 (Co-60) based radiation therapy continues to play a significant role in not only developing countries, where access to radiation therapy is extremely limited, but also in industrialized countries. Howver, technology has to be developed to accommodate modern techniques, including image guided and adaptive radiation therapy (IGART). In this paper we describe some of the practical and clinical considerations for Co-60 based tomotherapy by comparing Co-60 and 6 MV linac-based tomotherapy plans for a head and neck (HandN) cancer and a prostate cancer case. The tomotherapy IMRT plans were obtained by modeling a MIMiC binary multi-leaf collimator attached to a Theratron-780c Co-60 unit and a 6 MV linear accelerator (CL2100EX). The EGSnrc/BEAMnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code was used for the modeling of the treatment units with the MIMiC collimator and EGSnrc/DOSXYZnrc code was used for beamlet dose data. An in-house inverse treatment planning program was then used to generate optimized tomotherapy dose distributions for the H and N and prostate cases. The dose distributions, cumulative dose area histograms (DAHs) and dose difference maps were used to evaluate and compare Co-60 and 6 MV based tomotherapy plans. A quantitative analysis of the dose distributions and dose-volume histograms shows that both Co-60 and 6 MV plans achieve the plan objectives for the targets (CTV and nodes) and OARs (spinal cord in HandN case, and rectum in prostate case).	0

22843834	In vitro evaluation of tobramycin and aztreonam versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on cystic fibrosis-derived human airway epithelial cells. OBJECTIVES: Aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI) was recently approved by the FDA for treating cystic fibrosis (CF) patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here we investigated the effect of aztreonam alone or in combination with tobramycin on P. aeruginosa biofilms grown on CF airway epithelial cells. METHODS: P. aeruginosa biofilms, produced by laboratory strains or clinical isolates, were formed on confluent CF airway cells before treatment overnight with aztreonam or tobramycin alone or in combination. Alternatively, antibiotics were added 1 h after bacterial inoculation to assess their ability to impair biofilm formation at 5 h. Bacterial cfu remaining after treatment were then determined by plate counting. RESULTS: In the absence of antibiotics, all strains developed biofilms that disrupted CF airway epithelial monolayers overnight. Tobramycin reduced the cfu of all strains grown as biofilms. Aztreonam reduced the cfu of some strains by    1 log unit without preserving the integrity of cystic fibrosis airway cell monolayers, while decreasing the biofilms of other clinical isolates by    4 log units and protecting the monolayers from being compromised. The combination of aztreonam and tobramycin reduced the cfu of two strains by an additional 0.5 and 2 log units, respectively. Of all the mechanisms explored, Psl exopolysaccharide production might explain the variations in biofilm tolerance to aztreonam in some of the strains. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of aztreonam on P. aeruginosa biofilms in the in vitro co-culture model are strain-dependent. The simultaneous application of aztreonam and tobramycin may be beneficial for a subset of CF patients by eliminating susceptible P. aeruginosa strains.	0

12637547	Ets-2 and components of mammalian SWI/SNF form a repressor complex that negatively regulates the BRCA1 promoter. Ets-2 is a transcriptional activator that can be modulated by ras-dependent phosphorylation. Evidence is presented indicating that ets-2 can also act as a transcriptional repressor. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, exogenous ets-2 repressed the activity of a BRCA1 promoter-luciferase reporter dependent on a conserved ets-2-binding site in this promoter. Conditional overproduction of ets-2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in repression of endogenous BRCA1 mRNA expression. To address the mechanism by which ets-2 could act as a repressor, a biochemical approach was used to identify proteins that interacted with the ets-2 pointed domain. From this analysis, components of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex were found to interact with ets-2. Brg-1, the ATP-hydrolyzing component of the SWI/SNF complex, along with the BAF57/p50 and Ini1 subunits could be co-immunoprecipitated from cells with ets-2. The pointed domain of ets-2 directly interacted in vitro with the C-terminal region of Brg-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The combination of Brg-1 and ets-2 could repress the BRCA1 promoter reporter in transfection assays. These results support a role for ets-2 as a repressor and indicate that components of the mammalian SNF/SWI complex are required as co-repressors.	1
22139964	A simple and successful sonographic technique to identify the sciatic nerve in the parasacral area. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe detailed sonographic anatomy of the parasacral area for rapid and successful identification of the sciatic nerve. METHODS: Fifty patients scheduled for knee surgery were included in this observational study. An ultrasound-guided parasacral sciatic nerve block was performed in all patients. The ultrasound probe was placed on an axial plane 8 cm lateral to the uppermost point of the gluteal cleft. Usually, at this level the posterior border of the ischium (PBI), a characteristically curved hyperechoic line, could be identified. The sciatic nerve appeared as a hyperechoic structure just medial to the PBI. The nerve lies deep to the piriformis muscle lateral to the inferior gluteal vessels, and if followed caudally, it rests directly on the back of the ischium. After confirmation with electrical stimulation, a 20-mL mixture of 1% ropivacaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected. RESULTS: The sciatic nerve was identified successfully in 48 patients (96%). In those patients, the median time required for its ultrasonographic identification was ten seconds [interquartile range, 8-13.7 sec], and the block success rate was 100%. CONCLUSION: The described sonographic details of the parasacral area allowed for rapid and successful identification of the sciatic nerve.	0

12358353	Inspiratory neural drive response to hypoxia adequately estimates peripheral chemosensitivity in OSAHS patients. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationships between the responses to progressive isocapnic hypoxia and hypoxic withdrawal test in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) and to analyse the determinants of carotid body sensitivity in OSAHS. Nineteen consecutive OSAHS patients and 13 healthy subjects were selected. Ventilatory (delta V'I/Sa,O2/BSA) and inspiratory neural drive (delta P0.1/Sa,O2) responses to progressive isocapnic hypoxia were determined. Peripheral chemosensitivity was evaluated by the hypoxic withdrawal test, which measures the decrease in ventilation caused by two breaths of 100% oxygen (%delta V'I). Withdrawal response and ventilatory and inspiratory neural drive responses to hypoxia were lower in OSAHS patients than in control subjects. In patients with OSAHS, %delta V'I correlated significantly with delta V'I/Sa,O2/BSA and with delta P0.1/Sa,O2. On stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, a strong correlation between %delta V'I and delta P0.1/Sa,O2 was found. Moreover, %delta V'I, delta V'I/Sa,O2/BSA and delta P0.1/Sa,O2 were significantly correlated with minimum arterial oxygen saturation and with arousal index. Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome patients have a strong relationship between peripheral chemosensitivity and respiratory response to hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxic stimulation of central chemoreceptors is minimally relevant in obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome. Moreover, sensitivity of the carotid body in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome is related to sleep disruption and to nocturnal hypoxia.	0
8463996	Errors introduced in radioligand binding studies due to displaceable, cation dependent, [3H]prazosin binding to glass-fibre filters and glass surfaces. [3H]prazosin not only specifically and homogeneously labels alpha 1-adrenoceptors, but also binds to glass surfaces and non-linearly to the glass-fibre filters, commonly used in radioligand binding experiments. Binding to filters can be modulated by unlabeled alpha-adrenergic compounds and cations. If no correction is applied for displaceable filter binding, analysis of [3H]prazosin binding experiments leads to erroneous results. Analysis of [3H]prazosin saturation experiments on guinea-pig cerebral cortex membranes with correction for filter binding before the non-linear fit procedure indicated that [3H]prazosin labels a homogeneous population of alpha 1-adrenoceptors (Rtot: 8.33 fmol.mg-1 wet tissue) with a dissociation constant of 1.28 x 10(-10) M. However, analysis of the same data after correction for non-specific binding, (determined in parallel experiments by adding 10 microM phentolamine to the incubation medium) resulted in a best fit to a model in which [3H]prazosin labels two alpha 1-adrenoceptor subpopulations (R1: 15.0 fmol.mg-1 and R2: 14.6 fmol.mg-1 wet tissue) with dissociation constants of respectively 1.78 x 10(-10) and 5.63 x 10(-9) M. The discrepancy between the two methods of analysis is due to displacement of the radioligand from the filters by phentolamine. Prazosin and oxymetazoline are also able to displace filter-bound [3H]prazosin. The extent to which displaceable filter binding distorts the proper results depends on the actual magnitude of the error and also on the method of analysis.	0
24500000	Influence of zinc on calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways during aluminium-induced neurodegeneration. Metals perform important functions in the normal physiological system, and alterations in their levels may lead to a number of diseases. Aluminium (Al) has been implicated as a major risk factor, which is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, zinc (Zn) is considered as a neuromodulator and an essential dietary element that regulates a number of biological activities in our body. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Zn supplementation, if any, in ameliorating the changes induced by Al on calcium signalling pathway. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 140-160  g were divided into four different groups viz.: normal control, aluminium treated (100  mg/kg b.wt./day via oral gavage), zinc treated (227  mg/l in drinking water) and combined aluminium and zinc treated. All the treatments were carried out for a total duration of 8  weeks. Al treatment decreased the Ca(2+) ATPase activity whereas increased the levels of 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate, intracellular calcium and total calcium content in both the cerebrum and cerebellum, which, however, were modulated upon Zn supplementation. Al treatment exhibited a significant elevation in the protein expressions of phospholipase C, inositol triphosphate and protein kinase A but decreased the expression of protein kinase C, which, however, was reversed upon Zn co-treatment. Al treatment also revealed alterations in neurohistoarchitecture in the form of calcium deposits, which were improved upon zinc co-administration. The present study, therefore, suggests that zinc regulates the intracellular calcium signalling pathway during aluminium-induced neurodegeneration.	0

12749760	INGN 201: Ad-p53, Ad5CMV-p53, Adenoviral p53, INGN 101, p53 gene therapy--Introgen, RPR/INGN 201. Introgen's adenoviral p53 gene therapy [INGN 201, ADVEXIN] is in clinical development for the treatment of various cancers. The p53 tumour suppressor gene is deleted or mutated in many tumour cells and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human tumours. INGN 201 has been shown to kill cancer cells directly. In August 2002, Introgen announced plans to file an application for INGN 201 with the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer; the European filing will be submitted simultaneously with the previously scheduled (planned for 2004) submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for ADVEXIN to the US FDA. On 20 February 2003, INGN 201 received orphan drug designation from the US FDA for head and neck cancer. INGN 201 is available for licensing although Introgen favours retaining partial or full rights to the therapy in the US. Introgen Therapeutics and its collaborative partner for the p53 programme, Aventis Gencell, have been developing p53 gene therapy products. The agreement was originally signed by Rh  ne-Poulenc Rorer's Gencell division, which became Aventis Gencell after Rh  ne-Poulenc Rorer merged with Hoechst Marion Roussel to form Aventis Pharma. According to the original agreement, Introgen was responsible for phase I and preclinical development in North America, while Aventis Gencell was responsible for clinical trials conducted in Europe and for clinical trials in North America beyond phase I. In April 2001, Aventis Gencell and Introgen restructured their existing collaboration agreement for p53 gene therapy products. Aventis Gencell indicated that p53 research had suffered from internal competition for resources and was pulling back from its development agreement with Introgen for p53 gene therapy products. Introgen will assume responsibility for worldwide development of all p53 programmes and will obtain exclusive worldwide commercial rights to p53-based gene therapy products. Aventis Gencell will increase its equity stake in Introgen by investing  US 20 million in non-voting preferred shares of Introgen that will be convertible to Introgen common shares at a premium to the market price. Introgen will also receive a 5% equity stake in Aventis Gencell. Introgen intends to use the proceeds of Aventis Gencell's investment to fund the commercialisation of the p53 gene therapy product and to begin building its internal sales and marketing division to support the products anticipated market introduction. In April 2001, Aventis Pharma announced that it intended to spin off its gene therapy division, Aventis Gencell, as a separate operating company. In mid-2002, Aventis Pharma was still attempting to spin off Aventis Gencell but negotiations with venture capital partners had failed. Gene Logic (formerly OncorMed) of the US was contracted by Introgen to perform the p53 status testing for RPR/INGN 201 phase I clinical trials. In February 2003, Introgen announced it will streamline its phase III clinical trials for head and neck cancer to reduce spending, and that INGN 201 received Orphan Drug Status for head and neck cancer in the US. According to results (published in January 2003) of Introgen's phase II study of non-metastatic patients with non-small cell lung cancer (ineligible to receive surgery or combination therapy with radiation and cancer chemotherapy) treated with INGN 201 combined with radiation therapy, approximately 60% of patients' primary tumours regressed or disappeared after the combination therapy, as assessed by both biopsies and by CT scans 3 months after treatment. Investigators commented that further randomised trials are needed to follow-up on these observations. In February 2003, Introgen announced that it will move ahead with the development of registration plans for a non-small cell lung cancer indication for INGN 201, and is now including support for lung cancer registration in partnering discussions. RPR/INGN 201 is undergoing phase I trials for the potential treatment of lung, breast, ovarian, bladder, liver and brain cancers. Introgen and Aventis Pharma had signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). NCI will sponsor clinical trials to evaluate and develop RPR/INGN 201 as a potential anticancer agent for these cancer indications. The trials conducted under a NCI-sponsored IND will evaluate RPR/INGN 201 alone and in combination with other anticancer agents. This agreement was originally signed by Rh  ne-Poulenc Rorer's Gencell. Introgen has completed three phase I clinical trials with INGN 201 in patients with bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma, ovarian cancer and recurrent glioblastomas, respectively. Intratumoural injection of RPR/INGN 201 in patients with recurrent glioblastomas was well tolerated and resulted in expression of the p53 protein. Direct administration of RPR/INGN 201 to the lower airways of patients with bronchioalveolar cell lung carcinoma resulted in symptomatic improvement and improved lung function in some patients. In February 2003, Introgen announced that the US Patent and Trademark Office has issued to The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, patent No. 6,511,847 entitled \"Recombinant p53 Adenovirus Methods and Compositions\". Introgen Therapeutics is the exclusive licensee of this patent. The patent covers any adenoviral DNA molecules that encode the p53 gene positioned under the control of a promoter. Such a DNA molecule forms the genetic core of Introgen's ADVEXIN cancer therapy. Introgen's ADVEXIN therapy is now covered by up to ten separate US patents relevant to the product including compositions, therapeutic methods of administering the product in virtually any form, alone and in conjunction with the most widely used chemotherapeutic and radiation treatments, as well as its production. Introgen has a number of US patents that relate to the clinical use of ADVEXIN in cancer as monotherapy or in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation therapies, or other agents that have a damaging effect on the DNA or survival of (i.e. 2-methoxyestradiol, patent No. 6,410,029) cancer cells. In July 2002, the US Patent and Trademark Office issued to The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System US patent No. 6,410,010. The patent broadly covers all adenoviral p53 compositions (including ADVEXIN), therapeutic and otherwise, that express adequate p53 in amounts sufficient to suppress the growth of or kill cancer cells in patients. The patent also covers adenoviral p53 that incorporates a specific type of promoter that helps cells to express the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Introgen is the exclusive licensee of this composition of matter patent covering ADVEXIN. In December 2002, Aventis Pharmaceuticals was issued US patent No. 6,262,032 B1 entitled \"Method of Destroying Hyperproliferative Cells by Combining p53 and Taxoid Treatment\". Introgen has an exclusive license to this patent and is using this type of combination therapy in its breast cancer trial. Introgen expects to realise  US 2.5-3 million from sales of INGN 201.	0
15905941	[Removal of the vertical portion of the lacrimal canaliculus in dry eye syndrome]. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the efficacy and possible complications of a surgical technique that includes the removal of the vertical portion of the lacrimal canaliculus in patients with dry eye syndrome. METHODS: A study was performed on six canaliculi of six eyes (four patients). Three patients had dry eye, associated with primary Sj  gren syndrome. One of the four patients developed keratoconjuntivitis sicca due to lacrimal gland removal. The criteria included: patients with symptoms of dry eye that did not improve even with the continuous use of artificial tears, low results (less than 5 mm) with the Schirmer test, rose bengal staining and cases of recanalization after thermal occlusion with electrocauterium. The lacrimal puncta were examined after 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 180 days after surgery. RESULTS: None of the canaliculus recanalized at this time. Punctate keratitis, corneal filaments, Schirmer and rose bengal tests improved in 5 eyes. Diffuse punctate keratitis was present in the patient with lacrimal gland removal even 2 months after of surgery. Eyelid margin complications were not observed. CONCLUSION: This technique is simple and effective in permanent lacrimal canaliculus occlusion. We did not note any complications compared to other procedures.	0

12548605	A population-based analysis of risk factors for a second primary cutaneous melanoma among melanoma survivors. BACKGROUND: The results of several studies have provided evidence that patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma (CM) are at a higher risk of developing a second primary CM than the general population. In this study, the authors examined how the risk of a second primary tumor varied with time from diagnosis of CM and examined the patient-specific factors that modify a CM patient's risk of developing a second primary tumor. METHODS: Survival curves for time from first CM to second CM were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine which demographic- and disease-related factors influence the risk of a second CM. RESULTS: Approximately 0.5% of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) CM patients were found to have synchronous second primaries. The estimated cumulative probability of having a second primary CM was 0.99% at 1 year after initial CM diagnosis, 2.06% at 5 years, 3.17% at 10 years, and 5.34% at 20 years. Risk was significantly greater for males; older patients; patients with first CM on the face, neck, or trunk; those from the Atlanta, Hawaii, or Connecticut registries; and more recently diagnosed patients. Risk was lower for patients from the Utah registry and those with Stage IV disease. CONCLUSIONS: The elevated risk for CM among CM survivors appears to be greatest in the first few months, and then subsequently declines. However, the risk for a second CM among CM survivors was found to remain substantially higher than the risk for a first CM in the general population throughout the observation period (> 20 years). Demographic- and disease-related factors substantially modify the risk of a second primary CM.	0
20127363	Heterorhabditis amazonensis (Rhabditidae: Heterorhabditidae), strain RSC-5, for biological control of the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (Acari: Ixodidae). The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of different doses of Heterorhabditis amazonensis RSC-5 on the biological parameters of engorged females of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. The female ticks, individually identified, were divided into six groups of 20 each and exposed to the following nematode concentrations: 0, 75, 150, 300, 600, and 1,200/female. The following parameters were observed: initial weight, final weight, alteration weight, egg mass weight, pre-oviposition period, oviposition period, survival period, incubation period, hatching percentage, reproductive efficiency index (REI), nutritional efficiency index (NI), and percentage of control. There were no significant differences observed for the initial weight, pre-oviposition period, incubation period, and NI (p > 0.05) between the various treated groups and the control group. However, there were significant differences (p < 0.01) for the oviposition and survival periods between all the treated groups and the control group. For the final weight, alteration weight, egg mass weight, and REI, only the treatment with 1,200 nematode/female did not differ significantly from the respective figures for the control group (p > 0.05). The highest control rate was 67.8%, obtained in the treatment with a concentration of 300 entomopathogenic nematodes/female. The results demonstrate that this nematode has a deleterious effect on the majority of the biological parameters analyzed.	0

18605990	Atrial natriuretic peptide and three-dimensional echocardiography after transcatheter closure of atrial septal defect. BACKGROUND: Atrial septal defect (ASD) accounts for 10% of all congenital heart lesions and represent the third most congenital cardiac defect seen in adults. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is an important regulator of the sodium and volume homeostasis. This study was designed to investigate the changes in plasma ANP concentrations and three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) measurements of cardiac volume in patients with ASD during transcatheter closure of defect. METHODS: Plasma ANP concentrations and transthoracic 3DE measurements of right ventricular volume were performed in 46 patients with ASD before closure, and at 3 days after closure. 22 healthy subjects matched for age, sex served as control subjects. RESULTS: The 46 patients (20 men, 26 women; mean age 26.32 +/- 13.28, range 6 to 63 years) were diagnosed to secundum ASD (the stretched diameters of ASD were from 9~36(25.34 +/- 7.80 mm), and had been successfully placed Amplatzer septal occluder (the sizes of occluder were from 11 to 40 mm). The results showed that compared with control subjects, plasma ANP concentrations were elevated in patients with ASD. Plasma ANP concentrations positively correlated significantly with pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (r = 0.74, p < 0.05) and 3DE measurements of cardiac volumes (right ventricular end-diastolic (r = 0.50, p < 0.05) and end-systolic volume (r = 0.50, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with RVEF (r = -0.38, p < 0.05). Transthoracic 3DE measurements of right ventricular volume and plasma ANP concentrations decreased significantly at 3 days after closure (p < 0.05) compared with it before closure. CONCLUSION: Plasma ANP concentrations were markedly elevated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and right ventricular volume overload and decreased significantly after closure of ASD. This study suggested that ANP may help to identify patients with ASD complicated by pulmonary arterial hypertension and right ventricular volume overload that demanded early intervention and may become effective marker for evaluating changes in cardiac load after transcatheter ASD closure.	0
21580108	2-Propynyl 2-hydroxy-benzoate. The title compound, C(10)H(8)O(3), has been synthesized as part of our investigations into the generation of new anti-bacterial agents and serves as a building block for the synthesis of compound libraries. The compound crystallizes with two independent mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit. The transoid propynyl ester groups are coplanar with the 2-hydroxy-benzoate group with maximum deviations of -0.3507   (3) and 0.1591   (3)      for the terminal carbons, with intra-molecular O-H   O hydrogen bonding providing rigidity to the structure and ensuring that the reactivity of the alkyne is not compromised by steric factors. The propynyl group forms inter-molecular C-H   O inter-actions with the phenolic O atom. Supra-molecular chains along the b axis are found for both mol-ecules with links by weak O-H   O inter-molecular inter-actions in the first independent mol-ecule and C-H   O inter-actions in the second.	0
22860036	Development of a charting method to monitor the individual performance of surgeons at the beginning of their career. BACKGROUND: Efforts to provide a valid picture of surgeons' individual performance evolution should frame their outcomes in relation to what is expected depending on their experience. We derived the learning curve of young thyroidectomy surgeons as a baseline to enable the accurate assessment of their individual outcomes and avoid erroneous conclusions that may derive from more traditional approaches. METHODS: Operative time and postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy of 2006 patients who underwent a thyroidectomy performed by 19 young surgeons in five academic hospitals were monitored from April 2008 to December 2009. The database was randomly divided into training and testing datasets. The training data served to determine the expected performance curve of surgeons during their career and factors influencing outcome variation using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). To simulate prospective monitoring of individual surgeon outcomes, the testing data were plotted on funnel plots and cumulative sum charts (CUSUM). Performance charting methods were utilized to present outcomes adjusted both for patient case-mix and surgeon experience. RESULTS: Generation of performance curves demonstrated a gradual reduction in operative time from 139 (95% CI, 137 to 141) to 75 (71 to 80) minutes, and from 15.7% (15.1% to 16.3%) to 3.3% (3.0% to 3.6%) regarding the nerve palsy rate. Charts interpretation revealed that a very young surgeon had better outcomes than expected, whereas a more experienced surgeon appeared to be a poor performer given the number of years that he had already spent in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Not considering the initial learning curve of surgeons exposes them to biased measurement and to misinterpretation in assessing their individual performance for thyroidectomy. The performance chart represents a valuable tool to monitor the outcome of surgeons with the expectation to provide safe and efficient care to patients.	0

11845748	Communication skills: some problems in nursing education and practice. This article is based on a literature review carried out as part of a study of communication skills training in pre-registration nursing education in England in 2000. A systematic literature search was conducted and 200 articles were found that were relevant to the study. Definitional problems were found, with terms such as communication skills and interpersonal skills being used interchangeably. The term communications strategies is suggested to overcome these problems, as it reflects the logical organization of a number of different communication skills within a theoretical or empirical framework. Problems in current communication skills teaching and social barriers to using communication skills in practice are discussed. It is concluded that problems continue to exist in these areas and that an emphasis on both aspects is needed if patient and staff satisfaction is to be improved.	0

7830333	A case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia with atrial flutter. A 57-year-old male who had arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) with recurrent atrial flutter (AF) is reported. The patient had more frequent episodes of AF than of ventricular arrhythmias. Magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography and right ventriculography revealed dilatation of the right ventricle and endomyocardial biopsy specimens from the right ventricle showed findings which were compatible with ARVD. The left ventricular specimen, however, also revealed a loss of myocytes and interstitial fibroelastic changes. The present case demonstrates an overlap of post-inflammatory or primary endomyocardial fibroelastic changes with ARVD.	0
7713321	Cardiovascular response to exercise in diabetic patients: influence of autonomic neuropathy of different severity. We investigated cardiovascular function and plasma catecholamine response during incremental exercise and recovery in diabetic patients with (DAN+) and without autonomic neuropathy (DAN-). The former group was divided according to the presence of parasympathetic (DAN+PH-) or associated parasympathetic and sympathetic (DAN+PH+) damage to the autonomic nervous system. A group of healthy volunteers was studied as a control group. All the patients and control subjects underwent a submaximal or symptom-limited incremental exercise test using a cycle-ergometer. Air flow and respiratory gas fractions were sampled at the level of the mouth allowing a breath-by-breath analysis of oxygen consumption (VO2). Heart rate and systolic blood pressure were recorded and venous blood samples were obtained from the patients at rest and during each minute of exercise and recovery to measure norepinephrine and epinephrine plasma levels. Haemodynamic parameters and plasma catecholamines were computed at rest and at 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the peak VO2 (VO2max). The breath-by-breath relationships among VO2, heart rate and VO2/heart rate against work were assessed during exercise for patients and control subjects. While VO2max in absolute values was not significantly different among the diabetic groups, VO2 max was much less in diabetic patients than in control subjects (p < 0.01). During exercise the rate of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, norepinephrine and epinephrine increase was different among the diabetic groups, being significantly blunted in DAN+PH+. The VO2/work relationship of the three diabetic groups was similar but markedly reduced in respect to that of control subjects (p < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	0
15491899	Word learning in dogs? In a recent paper, Kaminski, Call and Fischer report pioneering research on word-learning in a dog. In this commentary we suggest ways of distinguishing referential word use from mere association. We question whether the dog is reasoning by exclusion and, if so, compare three explanations - learned heuristics, default assumptions, and pragmatic reasoning - as they apply to children and might apply to dogs. Kaminski et al.'s work clearly raises important questions about the origins and basis of word learning and social cognition.	0

10845635	Polymer-supported carbene complexes of palladium: well-defined, air-stable, recyclable catalysts for the Heck reaction N-Heterocyclic dicarbene chelate complexes of formula [cis-CH2N(H)C=C(H)N(R)C2PdX2] (X = Br, I; R = (CH2)nOH; n = 2, 3) have been prepared and structurally characterized (for X= I, n = 2). The complexes were immobilized on a functionalized polystyrene support (Wang resin) through one of the oxygen centres. The complexes efficiently catalyze the Heck reaction of activated and non-activated arylbromides, are recyclable under aerobic conditions and exhibit hardly any leaching, which is in line with our theoretical investigations on ligand dissociation energies related to Pd0 and PdII centres.	0

19515302	Attrition bias in a U.S. Internet survey of alcohol use among college freshmen. OBJECTIVE: Attrition bias is an important issue in survey research on alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. The issue is even more salient for Internet studies, because these studies often have higher rates of attrition than face-to-face or telephone surveys, and there is limited research examining the issue in the field of drug usage, specifically for college underclassmen. This study assessed whether measures of high-risk drinking and alcohol-related consequences were related to attrition groups (\"stayers\" or \"leavers\") in a cohort of college freshmen. METHOD: Data were collected in 2003 and 2004 from 2,144 first-year college students at 10 universities in the southeastern United States. Demographics, indicators of high-risk drinking, and alcohol-related consequences were compared between cohort stayers and leavers in statistical analyses using two methods. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that cohort leavers reported significantly higher levels of high-risk drinking (past-30-day heavy episodic drinking, weekly drunkenness) and past-30-day smoking but not significantly increased alcohol-related consequences. The directionality of bias was modestly consistent across outcomes and comparison methods. CONCLUSIONS: The current study's findings suggest that intervention efforts to reduce smoking or high-risk drinking need to consider attrition bias during study follow-up or account for it in analyses.	0
8102160	Tissue-specific distribution and age-dependent increase of human CD11b+ T cells. Distribution of CD11b Ag, a member of the leukocyte integrin (beta 2 integrin) family, on human T cells is not well characterized. We investigated in this study the tissue distribution and age-related alteration of human CD11b+ T cells. Significant proportions of CD11b+ cells were found in T cells from adult peripheral blood (18-58 yr) (20%), liver (32%), and spleen (16%), but were rarely observed in those from thymus, lymph nodes, intraepithelial lymphocytes, lamina propria lymphocytes, and lung. In contrast, percentages of CD28+ T cells, a counter population of CD11b+ T cells, were highest in lymph nodes (91%), modest in intraepithelial lymphocytes (82%), lamina propria lymphocytes (77%), PBL (77%), spleen (73%) and lower in thymus (62%), lung (60%) and liver (56%). The CD11b+ T cells from peripheral blood gradually increased with age, whereas the CD28+ T cells showed an age-dependent decrease. Namely, the percentages of CD11b+ T cells were 6% in newborns (cord blood), 15% in young adults (18 to 22 yr), 25% in middleaged adults (45 to 58 yr), and 27% in aged adults (72 to 86 yr), whereas those of CD28+ T cells were 96%, 83%, 72%, and 71%, respectively. Proportions of CD11b+ T cells in TCR-gamma delta+ or CD8+ T cells were, respectively, higher than those in TCR-alpha beta+ or CD4+ T cells. Age-dependent increase of CD11b+ T cells in CD8+ T cells was more obvious than that of CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, CD11b+ CD28+ T cells increased in the peripheral blood only of aged adults. The percentage of CD11b+ CD28+ T cells in TCR-gamma delta+ T cells was highest in young adults (25%), whereas that in CD4+ T cells was highest in aged adults (15%). CD11b+ CD28+ T cells expressed much potent IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4 at mRNA level than CD28+ CD11b- T cells or CD11b+ CD28- T cells, and had potential cytotoxic activity. Roles of CD11b+ T cells in vivo were discussed.	0

18564806	Intra-ocular pressure changes associated with intubation with the intubating laryngeal mask airway compared with conventional laryngoscopy. This open, prospective, randomised study was designed to evaluate the changes in intra-ocular pressure and haemodynamics after tracheal intubation using either the intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) or direct laryngoscopy. Sixty adult patients, ASA physical status 1 or 2 with normal intra-ocular pressure were randomly allocated to one of the two techniques. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol followed by rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was performed using either the ILMA or Macintosh laryngoscope. Intra-ocular pressure, heart rate and blood pressure were measured immediately before and after tracheal intubation and then minutely for five minutes. In the laryngoscopy group there was a significant increase in intra-ocular pressure (from 7.2+/-1.4 to 16.8+/-5.3 mmHg, P<0.01), which did not return to pre-intubation levels within five minutes, and also in mean arterial pressure after tracheal intubation, which returned to baseline levels after five minutes. In the ILMA group there were no significant changes in intra-ocular pressure (from 7.6+/-1.8 to 10.4+/-2.8 mmHg, P >0.05) or mean arterial pressure after tracheal intubation. Time to successful intubation was longer with the ILMA, 56.8+/-7.8 seconds, compared with the laryngoscopy group, 33+/-3.6 seconds (P<0.01). Mucosal trauma was more frequent with the ILMA (eight of 30) compared with the laryngoscopy group (three of 30) (P<0.01). The postoperative complications were comparable. In terms of minimising increases in intra-ocular pressure and blood pressure, we conclude that the ILMA has an advantage over direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation.	0
9776328	Individual memory change after anterior temporal lobectomy: a base rate analysis using regression-based outcome methodology. PURPOSE: To characterize patterns of base rate change on measures of verbal and visual memory after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) using a newly developed regression-based outcome methodology that accounts for effects of practice and regression towards the mean, and to comment on the predictive utility of baseline memory measures on postoperative memory outcome. METHODS: Memory change was operationalized using regression-based change norms in a group of left (n = 53) and right (n = 48) ATL patients. All patients were administered tests of episodic verbal (prose recall, list learning) and visual (figure reproduction) memory, and semantic memory before and after ATL. RESULTS: ATL patients displayed a wide range of memory outcome across verbal and visual memory domains. Significant performance declines were noted for 25-50% of left ATL patients on verbal semantic and episodic memory tasks, while one-third of right ATL patients displayed significant declines in immediate and delayed episodic prose recall. Significant performance improvement was noted in an additional one-third of right ATL patients on delayed prose recall. Base rate change was similar between the two ATL groups across immediate and delayed visual memory. Approximately one-fourth of all patients displayed clinically meaningful losses on the visual memory task following surgery. Robust relationships between preoperative memory measures and nonstandardized change scores were attenuated or reversed using standardized memory outcome techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated substantial group variability in memory outcome for ATL patients. These results extend previous research by incorporating known effects of practice and regression to the mean when addressing meaningful neuropsychological change following epilepsy surgery. Our findings also suggest that future neuropsychological outcome studies should take steps towards controlling for regression-to-the-mean before drawing predictive conclusions.	0

24124690	Phosphorylation of nucleoside-metallacarborane and carborane conjugates by nucleoside kinases. A library of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides modified with carborane or metallacarborane boron clusters at different locations, consisting of new molecules as well as already described compounds, was prepared. The compounds were tested as substrates for human deoxynucleoside kinases. Some conjugates, with modification attached to N3 of thymidine via a linker containing the triazole moiety, were efficiently phosphorylated by cytosolic thymidine kinase 1 and mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2. Higher phosphorylation levels were observed with thymidine kinase 1, the phosphorylation of nucleosides modified with metallacarboranes was observed for the first time.	0
6820432	Treatment of hyperargininaemia due to arginase deficiency with a chemically defined diet. A brother and sister aged 11 and 17 years have been reported previously to have hyperargininaemia and arginase deficiency: they were treated with a semi-synthetic diet consisting of fat, carbohydrate, minerals, vitamins and essential amino acids in amounts equivalent to 0.55-0.65 g protein kg-1 day-1 for 2 years. Plasma arginine levels fell from 0.50-0.90 mumol/1 to 0.13-0.30 mumol/1 (normal range 0.02-0.15). Increased concentrations of arginine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fell from 0.069-0.098 mumol/l to 0.040-0.056 mumol/l (normal mean +/- SD = 0.020 +/- 0.006). Dibasic aminoaciduria returned to normal within 1 week. Substitution of the keto-acid analogues of five essential amino acids in the formula lowered arginine concentrations further, but proved to be unpalatable. Urinary concentrations of orotic acid, uridine and uracil fell toward normal but remained increased, even when the plasma ammonia concentration was measured as normal. Both patients showed a stable clinical improvement.	0
23553649	Motivating health workers for the provision of directly observed treatment to TB patients in rural China: does cash incentive work? A qualitative study. As a key component of DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course) strategy, DOT is essential in the prevention of drug-resistant tuberculosis. However, DOT had very poor implementation in rural areas of China. One major reason to this problem was the lack of incentives for DOT providers. In 2005, the Chinese Minister of Health released an incentive strategy that aimed to improve the DOT performance of rural health workers by providing allowances. Our study used a qualitative method to explore the practical impact of this incentive strategy in motivating rural DOT providers, and searched for other potential incentive measures as well. A total of 16 focus group discussions were carried out among 102 rural health workers in eight counties of China. A semi-structured theme outline was used to collect the perception, attitude and experiences of health workers toward the DOT implementation as well as the cash incentive strategy. Findings showed that DOT allowance had some incentive effect to DOT providers, but its extent was circumscribed by the small amount and operational problems. Raising DOT allowance and removing existing barriers to DOT provision might result in a greater motivational impact, particularly in less developed areas of China, where health workers were more likely to encounter financial and other obstacles in delivering DOT services to TB patients in rural areas.	0
7527903	Mutagenicity of heterocyclic amines when activated by pancreas tissue. The heterocyclic amines (HA) 2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) were mutagenic in V79 cells (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts) using 6-thioguanine resistance as the marker of mutagenicity. Pancreas duct epithelial cells (DEC) from untreated hamsters, homogenates of pancreas ducts from untreated hamsters and those fed a high fat diet and human DEC were used to activate the heterocyclic amines. When hamster cells and tissues were used the optimum mutation frequencies (mutants/10(6) survivors) measured were: Glu-P-2, 10 +/- 1; MeIQ, 28 +/- 2 (DEC), 12 +/- 2 (control, duct homogenate), and 21 +/- 2 (high fat diet fed, duct homogenate); PhIP, 61 +/- 5. When human DEC were used the optimum mutation frequencies were: MeIQ, 32 +/- 4; PhIP, 35 +/- 3. 3,8-Dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline, 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole were not mutagenic in this assay.	0
11745725	Micropolarity and microviscosity of amitriptyline and dextran sulfate/carrageenan-amitriptyline systems: the nature of polyelectrolyte-drug complexes. The polarity and viscosity of the microenvironment of aggregates of the cationic amphiphilic drug amitriptyline and dextran sulfate (DxS)/carrageenan-amitriptyline aggregates in aqueous solution were investigated by means of steady state and time-resolved fluorescence. For the latter systems, equilibrium dialysis and capillary viscometry were also used. The micropolarity as detected by pyrene indicated the formation of amitriptyline aggregates, both with and without polyelectrolyte, having properties similar to \"traditional\" cationic micelles. The pyrene lifetime in the amitriptyline- and amitriptyline-polyelectrolyte aggregates was long ( approximately 230 and approximately 300 ns, respectively), indicating that pyrene was well protected from oxygen quenching, especially so in the latter case. The microviscosity of the amitriptyline aggregates themselves, and in the presence of polyelectrolyte, was high, as indicated by intramolecular excimer formation of 1,3-di(1-pyrenyl)-propane (P3P), rotational diffusion fluorescence depolarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), and intramolecular rotational relaxation about bonds of [p-(dimethylamino)benzylidene]-malonitrile (BMN). These results and the concurrent decrease of the bulk viscosity indicate that the polyelectrolyte, acting as polycounterion, is tightly wrapped around the amitriptyline aggregates. Amitriptyline hence behaves in accordance with accepted models of cationic surfactant-polyelectrolyte interaction.	0

7704411	Local and global changes in the morphology and distribution of replication centres in rapidly expanding nuclei. Sperm pronuclei assembled in Xenopus egg extracts undergo a 10-fold increase in volume over a typical 150-min incubation. Double immunofluorescence with anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibodies and biotinylated anologues of thymidine can be used to distinguish different phases of S-phase. The mean diameter of pronuclei at initiation was 12.42 microns. During the elongation phase of S-phase the mean diameter increased to 17.44 microns, equal to a sevenfold increase in nuclear volume. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate the morphology and distribution of replication centres through S-phase. In early S-phase nuclei, the mean centre-to-centre distance between any replication centre and its 10 nearest neighbours was 1.24 microns; this decreased significantly to 0.90 micron in mid S-phase nuclei and 0.99 micron in late S-phase nuclei. In addition, the morphology of replication foci also changed. In early S-phase nuclei, each replication focus was a discrete entity. However, as S-phase progressed neighbouring replication foci appeared to fuse giving rise to ring-like structures or string-like structures. Three-dimensional reconstructed images of z-series collected through early and late S-phase nuclei indicated that as nuclei enlarge replication centres appear to accumulate at the nuclear periphery. A model is proposed to accommodate the results described below.	0

18968439	A comparative physical study of two different hydrophilic synthetic latex matrices for the construction of a glucose biosensor. Two different biodegradable latex polymers functionalised by hydroxy (1) or gluconamide (2) groups proved to be good immobilisation matrixes for glucose oxidase. The responses of these biosensors to glucose additions were measured by potentiostating the modified electrodes at 0.6 V/SCE in order to oxidise the hydrogen peroxide generated by the enzymatic oxidation of glucose in the presence of oxygen. The response of such electrodes was evaluated as a function of film thickness, pH and temperature. Rotating disk electrode experiments showed the influence of the enzyme on the structure of both latex films, namely a marked improvement in matrix permeability. The high permeability of the latex 1 based enzyme sensor (bilayer, P(m)=8.10x10(-4) cm s(-1)) resulted in a high dynamic range. Furthermore, the activation energy for a latex 1 sensor was determined to be 44.55 and 18.03 kJ mol(-1), respectively depending on the conformation of the enzyme.	0
22483798	Enniatin B-induced cell death and inflammatory responses in RAW 267.4 murine macrophages. The mycotoxin enniatin B (EnnB) is predominantly produced by species of the Fusarium genera, and often found in grain. The cytotoxic effect of EnnB has been suggested to be related to its ability to form ionophores in cell membranes. The present study examines the effects of EnnB on cell death, differentiation, proliferation and pro-inflammatory responses in the murine monocyte-macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Exposure to EnnB for 24 h caused an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1-phase with a corresponding decrease in cyclin D1. This cell cycle-arrest was possibly also linked to the reduced cellular ability to capture and internalize receptors as illustrated by the lipid marker ganglioside GM1. EnnB also increased the number of apoptotic, early apoptotic and necrotic cells, as well as cells with elongated spindle-like morphology. The Neutral Red assay indicated that EnnB induced lysosomal damage; supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showing accumulation of lipids inside the lysosomes forming lamellar structures/myelin bodies. Enhanced levels of activated caspase-1 were observed after EnnB exposure and the caspase-1 specific inhibitor ZYVAD-FMK reduced EnnB-induced apoptosis. Moreover, EnnB increased the release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) in cells primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and this response was reduced by both ZYVAD-FMK and the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me. In conclusion, EnnB was found to induce cell cycle arrest, cell death and inflammation. Caspase-1 appeared to be involved in the apoptosis and release of IL-1b and possibly activation of the inflammasome through lysosomal damage and leakage of cathepsin B.	0
24419825	A comparative, prospective, and randomized study of two conservative treatment protocols for first-episode lateral ankle ligament injuries. BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate functional results, the amount of time that patients missed from regular working activities, and the incidence of residual mechanical ankle instability following conservative treatment of a first episode of severe lateral ankle ligament sprain (with articular instability). METHODS: This prospective and randomized study included 186 patients with severe lateral ankle ligament injuries, who were randomly assigned into 2 conservative treatment groups. In group A, participants were treated with a walking boot with weight-bearing allowed, pain management, ice, and elevation with restricted joint mobilization for 3 weeks. In group B, patients were treated with a functional brace for 3 weeks. After this period, patients from both groups were placed in a short, functional brace for an additional 3 weeks, during which they also started a rehabilitation program. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found in pain intensity score between the 2 groups; however, functional evaluations based on the AOFAS ankle and hindfoot score system showed a statistically significant improvement in the group treated with the functional brace. In addition, the average recovery period necessary for patients of group B to resume their duties was shorter than that for patients in group A. No significant difference was detected in residual mechanical ankle instability between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe lateral ankle ligament lesions treated with a functional brace were shown to exhibit somewhat better results than those treated with a walking boot, and both methods presented a very low incidence of residual chronic instability. We found adequate conservative treatment was sufficient to reestablish ankle stability and that functional treatment had a marginally better clinical short-term outcome with a shorter average recovery period. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, prospective randomized study.	0
10577408	New-generation anticoagulants: the low molecular weight heparins. Heparin has been the mainstay of acute anticoagulation therapy for decades. Within the past 20 years, several different heparin fractions-collectively known as low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs)-have been evaluated in various medical and surgical settings in which anticoagulation is routinely warranted. The LMWHs are efficacious, safe, cost-effective, and easier to administer and monitor than standard, unfractionated heparin. As LMWH use becomes more widespread, emergency physicians will use these new agents instead of unfractionated heparin for unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, or thromboembolic disease. This review focuses on the pharmacologic properties of unfractionated heparin and LMWH, associated complications, and the use of these agents in acute ischemic coronary syndromes, thromboembolic disease, and other selected clinical situations.	0
8022952	Gender-related differences in regional cerebral glucose metabolism in normal volunteers. Positron emission tomography studies have correlated changes in the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization (CMRglu) with symptoms of depression, aggression, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Psychiatric disorders in which these symptoms are manifested are disproportionately represented among the sexes. We evaluated gender differences in regional CMRglu in control subjects (21 men and 18 women) with particular interest in the global, orbital frontal, and left anterolateral prefrontal cortical (LAPFC) CMRglu. A trend was present for global CMRglu to be greater in women than in men. Regional CMRglu was lower in men than in women in the orbital frontal area. No differences were observed in the LAPFC region.	0
1336726	Tumor-suppressor genes: cardinal factors in inherited predisposition to human cancers. A predisposition to the development of certain specific and familial cancers is associated with the inheritance of a single mutated gene. In the best-characterized cases, this primary mutation is a loss of function mutation consistent with viability but resulting in neoplastic change consequent to the acquisition of a second somatic mutation at the same locus. Such genes are referred to as tumor-suppressor genes. Classical examples are the Rb-1 gene associated with the development of retinoblastoma and the p53 gene, which is associated with a wider range of neoplasms, including breast cancer. Other tumor-suppressor genes have been isolated which are associated with Wilms' tumor, neurofibromatosis, and inherited and sporadic forms of colorectal cancer. Some of these genes appear to act as negative regulators of mitotic cycle genes, and others may have different properties. The nature of these genes is discussed, as is the evidence for the involvement of tumor-suppressor genes in other inherited, and sporadic, forms of cancer. Some recent data on the Wilms' tumor gene, WT1, and on the involvement of the p53 gene in breast cancer are presented, and the importance of genomic imprinting in contributing to the excess of suppressor gene mutations in chromosomes of paternal origin is considered.	0

20042754	Outbreak of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) at a New York City school. BACKGROUND: In April 2009, an outbreak of novel swine-origin influenza A (2009 H1N1 influenza) occurred at a high school in Queens, New York. We describe the outbreak and characterize the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of this novel virus. METHODS: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene characterized the outbreak through laboratory confirmation of the presence of the 2009 H1N1 virus in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens and through information obtained from an online survey. Detailed information on exposure and the onset of symptoms was used to estimate the incubation period, generation time, and within-school reproductive number associated with 2009 H1N1 influenza, with the use of established techniques. RESULTS: From April 24 through May 8, infection with the 2009 H1N1 virus was confirmed in 124 high-school students and employees. In responses to the online questionnaire, more than 800 students and employees (35% of student respondents and 10% of employee respondents) reported having an influenza-like illness during this period. No persons with confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza or with influenza-like illness had severe symptoms. A linkage with travel to Mexico was identified. The estimated median incubation period for confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza was 1.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.8), with symptoms developing in 95% of cases by 2.2 days (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.6). The estimated median generation time was 2.7 days (95% CI, 2.0 to 3.5). We estimate that the within-school reproductive number was 3.3. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this investigation suggest that 2009 H1N1 influenza in the high school was widespread but did not cause severe illness. The reasons for the rapid and extensive spread of influenza-like illnesses are unknown. The natural history and transmission of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus appear to be similar to those of previously observed circulating pandemic and interpandemic influenza viruses.	0
12035554	[Effect of insulin on the composition of chromatin phospholipid in rat liver cells]. In vivo the action of insulin on rat liver chromatin phospholipid composition was investigated. It was shown that the hormone led to reliable increase (nearly 20%) of total phospholipid content. The same phenomenon was shown also in the fraction of active chromatin while the phospholipids content of non-active chromatin didn't changed. It was also shown that the content of three from six phospholipid fractions altered under the insulin action. The content of sphingomyelin and phosphatidilethanolamine increased and the quantity of phosphatidylinositol decreased under the hormone action. The decrease of monophosphoinositides content was accompanied by the reliable increase of triphosphoinositides amount. It was suggested that the fractions of chromatin polyphosphoinositides were redistributed under the action of insulin.	0
10327183	Subject's own speech reduces reactivity of the human auditory cortex. Previous studies on monkeys have shown that uttering-related cortical areas exert an inhibitory effect on the auditory cortex, and cerebral blood-flow analyses on humans have revealed modulation of the activity of the auditory cortex during own speech. To study this modulation on a millisecond time scale, we recorded neuromagnetic evoked responses to short 1-kHz tones while the subjects were reading silently and aloud. The 100-ms response (M100) of the auditory cortex was delayed by 10-21 ms and its amplitude was dampened by 44-71% during reading aloud compared with reading silently. This effect was more prominent in responses to ipsilateral than contralateral tones, possibly due to a sum effect of diminished ipsilateral input to the cortex and decreased transcallosal excitation.	0
15715122	Diabetic nephropathy--who cares? Diabetic nephropathy has become the most common single cause of Established Renal Failure (ERF) in the United States of America (USA) and Europe. In the United Kingdom (UK) diabetic nephropathy is seen in 18% of new patients requiring dialysis. In the USA 7.3% of all adults and 17.8% of those over 65 years have diabetes mellitus. Furthermore diabetic nephropathy is the cause of ERF in up to 45% of patients on dialysis. Recently compiled data by the World Health Organisation (WHO) shows that approximately 150 million people worldwide have diabetes and predict that this number may well have doubled to 300 million by 2025. These figures are clearly daunting and renal units must prepare themselves for the rising number of patients with diabetes needing renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the future. Renal specialist nurses do not always have a major role to play in the prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Their remit must be to try and delay the progression to ERF and perhaps more importantly to concentrate their efforts on their ERF patient population with diabetes that have co-existing diabetes related pathologies. This article will attempt to discuss how renal nurses can best expand/extend their skills and knowledge to provide effective care for this patient group, and explore whether developing new and innovative roles or just new ways of working is the way forward.	0
17455896	ADAR editing wobbles the microRNA world. Recent work reveals that adenosine-to-inosine editing occurs in a number of cellular microRNAs (miRNAs). Such editing is shown to diminish the expression of one miRNA and alter the target specificity of another. This changes our current views significantly by not only increasing the repertoire of miRNAs and their potential targets, but also providing mechanisms for how to regulate them and direct them to alternative targets.	0
8352385	Plasmodium coatneyi ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigens. Plasmodium coatneyi produced ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) during infection of the rhesus monkey. This antigen was immunogenic and elicited an antibody response that was not persistent but was boosted by repeated infections in a manner similar to that seen in P. falciparum infections in humans. Preliminary data showed that the appearance and increasing titer of antibodies to P. coatneyi RESA-like antigen were associated with prolongation of intervals from inoculation to patency and with control of parasitemia. Studies using both immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis showed that P. coatneyi-immune rhesus serum cross-reacted with P. falciparum antigens, but P. falciparum immune human serum did not recognize P. coatneyi antigens in either assay. These results show that P. coatneyi expresses RESA-like antigen that elicits an antibody response similar to that observed for human antibody to P. falciparum RESA. However, antibodies to P. coatneyi did not cross-react with P. falciparum RESA in erythrocyte membrane immunofluorescence assay and dot immunoblot analysis, suggesting that different immunogenic epitopes are present on the two molecules. Our observations support the use of this primate model in RESA-based vaccine development.	0

10708821	Urban/rural and gender differentials in suicide rates: east and west. BACKGROUND: Many epidemiological studies indicate suicide rates are higher for males than females and for urban than rural. Here we re-examine gender, urban and rural differentials in suicide in Australia and Beijing (China). More specifically, to test the two hypotheses (i) that the male to female ratio is larger than one; (ii) that the urban suicide rate is higher than the rural in both places. METHODS: Suicide data with information of gender, rural and urban regions for Australia and Beijing (China) for the period of 1991-1996 were used. Ratios between the gender-specific urban and rural suicides rates with the associated confidence intervals were constructed to examine gender, urban and rural differentials in Australia and Beijing. RESULTS: The rural suicide rate in Beijing for both genders was higher than for their urban counterparts. Further, the elderly had the highest suicide rate followed by women aged 20-29. Also, the male to female ratio in China was less than one. In Australia, the rural male suicide rate was higher than the urban whereas the urban female suicide rate was higher than the rural. The male to female ratio was 4 to 1. The differences in rural to urban and male to female ratios between Australia and Beijing are statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the west, male suicide rates are not higher than female rates in China. Urban rates are not necessarily higher than rural rates --not even in a western setting. Cultural factors and regional differences in socio-economic situation are significant in explaining the low gender ratio and the relatively higher suicide rates in rural China. LIMITATIONS: The suicide rate in the Beijing region might not exactly reflect the same for the whole of China.	0

22305581	Suppression of adipogenesis in mouse mesenchymal stem cells by imipramine. Imipramine (IM) has been widely used in clinics for the treatment of some mental diseases. The understanding of its role in other tissues or organs will be beneficial for its better clinical use. Here, it is shown that IM suppresses the adipogenic differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The accumulation of intracellular, Oil red O-stained lipid droplets was inhibited by IM in a dose-dependent manner. RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed that after IM loading, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y2 (PPARy2) decreased, demonstrating that the suppression of IM on MSC adipogenesis is at least partially mediated by the PPARy2 pathway. These findings suggest that, in appropriate doses, the conventional antidepressive (IM) may exert inhibitory effect on adipocyte formation.	0

7851935	An optimal control model for analyzing human postural balance. The question posed in this study is whether optimal control and state estimation can explain selection of control strategies used by humans, in response to small perturbations to stable upright balance. To answer this question, a human sensorimotor control model, compatible with previous work by others, was assembled. This model incorporates linearized equations and full-state feedback with provision for state estimation. A form of gain-scheduling is employed to account for nonlinearities caused by control and biomechanical constraints. By decoupling the mechanics and transforming the controls into the space of experimentally observed strategies, the model is made amenable to the study of a number of possible control objectives. The objectives studied include cost functions on the state deviations, so as to control the center of mass, provide a stable platform for the head, or maintain upright stance, along with a cost function on control effort. Also studied was the effect of time delay on the stability of controls produced using various control strategies. An objective function weighting excursion of the center of mass and deviations from the upright stable position, while taking advantage of fast modes of the system, as dictated by inertial parameters and musculoskeletal geometry, produces a control that reasonably matches experimental data. Given estimates of sensor performance, the model is also suited for prediction of uncertainty in the response.	0
14500661	Protein kinase A regulatory subunit type II beta directly interacts with and suppresses CREB transcriptional activity in activated T cells. Levels of the type IIbeta regulatory subunit (RIIbeta) of protein kinase A are abnormally high in the nuclei of T cells of some subjects with the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the role of nuclear RIIbeta in the regulation of T cell function is unknown. Based on previous studies demonstrating that nuclear protein kinase A-RII subunits can modify cAMP response element (CRE)-dependent transcription, we tested the hypothesis that nuclear RIIbeta can alter CRE-directed gene expression in T cells through interaction with the nuclear transcription factor CRE-binding protein CREB. To test this hypothesis, we used the RIIbeta-deficient S49 and the Jurkat T cell lines. In both cell lines, transient transfection of RIIbeta resulted in nuclear localization of a portion of the ectopically expressed RIIbeta. In vitro and in vivo analyses revealed a novel, specific interaction between RIIbeta and CREB that mapped to the N-terminal 135 aa of RIIbeta. In functional studies, RIIbeta inhibited the transcriptional activity of a GAL4-CREB fusion protein by 67% in Jurkat T cells following activation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs. Importantly, deletion of the CREB-binding region of RIIbeta completely abrogated inhibition. Additionally, RIIbeta suppressed CRE-directed reporter gene expression and substantially reduced induction of promoter activity and endogenous protein levels of the CREB-dependent gene, c-fos, in activated T cells. We conclude that nuclear RIIbeta can act as a repressor of CREB transcriptional activity in T cells, providing a potential functional significance for aberrant levels of nuclear RIIbeta in systemic lupus erythematosus T cells.	1
23364086	A rapid assessment of a community health worker pilot programme to improve the management of hypertension and diabetes in Emfuleni sub-district of Gauteng Province, South Africa. BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCD) and infectious chronic illnesses are recognised as significant contributing factors to the burden of disease globally, specifically in South Africa, yet clinical management is often poor. The involvement of community health workers (CHWs) in TB and HIV care in South Africa, and other low- and middle-income settings, suggests that they could make an important contribution in the management of NCDs. OBJECTIVES: Using a rapid assessment, this study examines the outcomes of a pilot CHW programme to improve the management of hypertension and diabetes in Gauteng province, South Africa. METHODS: A record review compared outcomes of patients receiving home visits (n56) with a control group (n168) attending the clinic, matched, as far as possible, on age, gender, and condition. Focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with CHWs, patients, district, clinic, and NGO staff were used to obtain descriptions of the functioning of the programme and patient experiences. RESULTS: Despite the greater age and co-morbidity among those in the pilot programme, the findings suggest that control of hypertension was improved by CHW home visits in comparison to usual clinic care. However, too few doctor visits, insufficient monitoring of patient outcomes by clinic staff, and a poor procurement process for supplies required by the CHWs hampered the programme's activities. CONCLUSION: The role of CHWs in the management of hypertension should be given greater consideration, with larger studies being conducted to provide more robust evidence. Adequate training, supervision, and operational support will be required to ensure success of any CHW programme.	0

19274077	Genetic polymorphisms and the risk of accelerated renal function decline in women. BACKGROUND: Reduced glomerular filtration rate is an important predictor of cardiovascular disease and death. Genetic polymorphisms, particularly in genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), may influence the rate of renal function decline. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the relation between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including those in the RAS, apolipoprotein E and alpha-adducin, and renal function decline assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over an 11-year period in 2578 Caucasian participants of the Nurses' Health Study. Logistic regression was used to examine the associations between genotype and risk of eGFR decline of >or=25%. RESULTS: After 11 years between creatinine measurements, the eGFR declined by >or=25% in 423 of 2578 (16%) women. The angiotensinogen (AGT) A-20C polymorphism was associated with a higher risk of renal function decline when two risk alleles were present than if one or no alleles were present (CC vs AA and AC) OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.02-3.26; p = 0.04). The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) A1166C polymorphism was marginally associated with a higher risk of renal function decline when two risk alleles were present (CC vs AA, OR = 1.41; 95% CI 0.98-2.01; p = 0.06). The alpha-adducin G460W polymorphism was associated with a lower risk of renal function decline when any number of risk alleles were present (WG vs GG, OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.99, p = 0.04; WW vs GG, OR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.20-1.07, p = 0.07). Linear regression analysis with change in eGFR as the outcome showed a larger decline of 3.5 (95% CI 0.5 to 6.4, p = 0.02) ml/min/1.73 m(2) in AGT A-20C CC homozygotes. No other polymorphisms were significantly associated with renal function decline or absolute change in eGFR over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in the angiotensinogen, angiotensin II type 1 receptor and alpha-adducin genes may contribute to loss of renal function in the general female Caucasian population.	0

20467597	Outcome of implant-supported single-tooth replacements performed by dental students. A 10-year clinical and radiographic retrospective study. SOURCE OF SUPPORT: The study was partially supported by Nobel Biocare, Denmark. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: None. AIM: To evaluate the treatment outcome of implant-supported single-tooth replacements performed by dental students as part of their undergraduate dental curriculum after a mean follow-up period of 10 years (range: 7.5 to 12 years). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 patients were consecutively treated by dental students with 55 implants supporting single crowns. The treatment was performed under supervision of dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons, all with special knowledge about oral implantology. Survival of implant crown, survival of implant, probing depth, bleeding on probing and peri-implant marginal bone level change were evaluated at the end of the follow-up period. In addition, biological and technical complications during the entire follow-up period were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with 49 implants were available at the end of the study. The survival of the implant crowns as well as the implants was 94%. The mean probing depth at patient level was 4.8 mm. The probing depth varied between 2 and 10 mm at the individual site. The mean bleeding on probing score was 0.57 at patient level and absence of bleeding around all sites of the implants was rarely observed. The mean bone level change was -0.14 mm (range: 1.2 to -1.1 mm) during the first year of loading and 0.16 mm (range: 1.4 to -1.8) after 10 years at patient level. Five episodes of peri-implant inflammation due to excess cement were registered in five patients. Moreover, a fistula was observed at two implants in two patients. Finally, five technical complications occurred in five patients. CONCLUSIONS: Implant-supported single-tooth replacements performed by dental students as part of their undergraduate dental curriculum were characterised by high survival rates as well as few biological and technical complications. It seems acceptable to include implant therapy in the clinical undergraduate dental curriculum, provided a focus remains on straightforward cases with substantial supervision by trained dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons.	0
11227273	Fine sediment influence on salmonid spawning habitat in a lowland agricultural stream: a preliminary assessment. Spawning habitat utilized by Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) and Sea Trout (Salmo trutta) was characterized in a 1.6-km reach of the Newmills Burn, a small, highly canalized tributary of the River Don in Aberdeenshire. The Newmills Burn is typical of the intensively farmed lower sub-catchments of the major salmon rivers on the east coast of Scotland. Such streams have substantial potential in providing spawning and juvenile habitat for salmonids, with high redd densities resulting in egg deposition rates of > 5 m2. However, in comparison with upland spawning tributaries draining less intensively managed catchments, canalization and intensive cultivation has seriously degraded the physical characteristics of aquatic habitats in many streams. In the Newmills Burn, spawning gravels have a relatively high (> 20% by mass) fine sediment (< 2 mm in size) content. The burn is characterized by hydraulic conditions that are suitable for salmonid spawning, with modal velocities of 0.50-0.65 m s(-1) and depths of 0.20-0.25 m. However, infiltration of fine sediments into gravels is rapid during hydrological events in the winter months. Thus, complete siltation of open gravel matrices (simulated redds) can occur within a week, and probably within a single moderate to large storm event. Appreciable, but small, deposition of organic and silt/clay particles can also affect spawning gravels. Egg mortalities in redds following spawning are variable, but can be as high as 86% in the Newmills Burn. This may be related to fine sediment infiltration, reduced permeability of spawning gravels and reduced oxygen supply to ova. It appears that the main cause of high influx is sediment loads mobilized from intensively managed land. It is suggested that fundamental changes to the management of agricultural land is required if fish habitats are to be improved and degraded streams are allowed to re-naturalize. The need for closely focused investigations of the causal relationships between fine sediment infiltration and egg survival is stressed.	0

8793429	Imaging of the anorectal region. Imaging of anorectal region has drastically changed during the last decade. Transrectal ultrasound and transrectal MRI can be used for staging the rectal tumours. Endoanal sonography can be applied for the classification of perianal fistulae and identification of anal sphincter defects in patients with faecal incontinence. Due to the limitations of endoanal sonography, endoanal MRI was introduced to assess the pathology related to the anal sphincter complex. Endoanal MRI seems superior to endoanal sonography. This paper describes the new developments of the imaging techniques and presents new insights in anatomy and pathology of the anorectum.	0
17425427	Immunologic, virologic, and neuropsychologic responses in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children receiving their first highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen. Our objective was to measure the early dynamics, evolution, and durability over 96 wk of immunologic responses in children receiving their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. The study was designed as a prospective, single-arm study. Twelve human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children (median age, 11.8 yr) were enrolled. All subjects received stavudine, nevirapine, and ritonavir. Serial measurements included HIV viral load, lymphocyte subsets, thymic volume by computed tomography (CT), neurocognitive testing, and brain CT. Baseline median CD4(+) T cell count was 589 cells/mm(3) , viral load was 3.9 log(10) HIV RNA copies/mL, and thymic volume was 16.3 cm(3) . Ten children had an undetectable viral load at week 48. Eight maintained an undetectable viral load at 96 wk. The median increase in absolute CD4(+) T cell count was 225 cells/mm(3) by week 48, and 307 cells/mm(3) by week 96. The median increase in naive (CD45RA(+) CD62L(+) ) CD4(+) T cells was 133 cells/mm(3) by week 48, and 147 cells/mm(3) by week 96. The median number of naive CD8(+) T cells increased from 205 to 284 cells/mm(3) by week 24; this increase was sustained to week 96. The number of B cells increased and was associated with a decrease in immunoglobulin levels. The number of natural killer cells was stable. There were no significant changes in thymic volume. Most children exhibited stable cognitive function over the course of the study. We conclude that, in this cohort of relatively immunocompetent HIV-infected children, an initial HAART regimen was associated with rapid and sustained increases in total CD4(+) T cells, in naive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and in B cells through 96 wk.	0
16941044	Therapy insight: management of cardiovascular disease in the renal transplant recipient. Cardiovascular disease causes the deaths of up to 50% of renal transplant recipients who have a functioning graft. As in other states of chronic kidney disease, both overload cardiomyopathy (chronic heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy) and ischemic heart disease are evident; age and gender are important risk factors for both of these disorders. Potentially treatable risk factors include smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and hypertension for ischemic heart disease, and anemia, hypertension and diabetes for cardiomyopathy. Although definitive evidence on the effectiveness of interventions is lacking, it seems reasonable to treat renal transplant recipients as patients at the highest risk of cardiovascular disease. Aggressive targeting of lifestyle factors, blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar regulation is likely to have a major impact on patient and graft survival and should be initiated well before transplantation. Maintenance of hemoglobin with erythropoietic agents is controversial but might improve quality of life. Although immunosuppressive agents have distinct effects on cardiovascular risk factors, the impact on outcomes is impossible to predict on the basis of current data, and no firm recommendations can be made.	0

14987849	Investigations on the effects of cobalt-alkyne complexes on leukemia and lymphoma cells: cytotoxicity and cellular uptake. Cobalt-alkyne complexes represent a new class of antiproliferative drugs with high activity on cell lines derived from human solid tumors. These promising results encouraged us to evaluate also their effects against leukemia and lymphoma cells. For this purpose, we selected three cobalt complexes with (2-propyn-1-yl)acetylsalicylate (Co-ASS), 2-propyn-1-ol (Co-Prop) and diphenylacetylene (Co-Diph) ligands and investigated their growth inhibiting properties on the LAMA-84, K-562, SD-1 leukemia and U-937 lymphoma cell lines. The cobalt complexes showed high effects on LAMA-84 cells (IC(50)=7.7-16.8 microM) after 48 and 72 h of incubation, but were inactive (K-562, U-937) or low active (SD-1) on the other cell lines. The proliferation of SD-1 cells was reduced by Co-Prop (IC(50)=18.6 microM) and Co-Diph (IC(50)=7.5 microM) only after a 72 h exposure. The antiproliferative effects did not correlate with the accumulation of the drugs into the tumor cells. The time dependent uptake during 24 h determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy was comparably the same in sensitive LAMA-84 and insensitive K-562 cells.	0

11742124	Conformational strictness required for maximum activity and stability of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A as revealed by crystallographic study of three Phe120 mutants at 1.4 A resolution. The replacement of Phe120 with other hydrophobic residues causes a decrease in the activity and thermal stability in ribonuclease A (RNase A). To explain this, the crystal structures of wild-type RNase A and three mutants--F120A, F120G, and F120W--were analyzed up to a 1.4 A resolution. Although the overall backbone structures of all mutant samples were nearly the same as that of wild-type RNase A, except for the C-terminal region of F120G with a high B-factor, two local conformational changes were observed at His119 in the mutants. First, His119 of the wild-type and F120W RNase A adopted an A position, whereas those of F120A and F120G adopted a B position, but the static crystallographic position did not reflect either the efficiency of transphosphorylation or the hydrolysis reaction. Second, His119 imidazole rings of all mutant enzymes were deviated from that of wild-type RNase A, and those of F120W and F120G appeared to be \"inside out\" compared with that of wild-type RNase A. Only approximately 1 A change in the distance between N(epsilon2) of His12 and N(delta1) of His119 causes a drastic decrease in k(cat), indicating that the active site requires the strict positioning of the catalytic residues. A good correlation between the change in total accessible surface area of the pockets on the surface of the mutant enzymes and enthalpy change in their thermal denaturation also indicates that the effects caused by the replacements are not localized but extend to remote regions of the protein molecule.	0
20381188	The evolution of smoke-free spaces policy literature: a bibliometric analysis. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes patterns in the international published literature regarding smoke-free spaces policy through a bibliometric analysis of journals, articles and authors from 1990 to 2009. METHODS: Secondary data from a recent systematic literature review were analyzed. Bibliometric techniques included statistical analysis of publication counts and co-citation analysis. Findings were generated through calculations of frequencies of journals, authors, and articles published per year. Analysis was conducted for five policy-relevant domains: public place, schools, private space, workplace, and tobacco industry tactics. RESULTS: Of the 5656 total articles examined, scientific articles written for the public place and workplace domains far outweighed those for schools, private spaces, and tobacco industry. This bibliometric analysis indicated that publication patterns aligned with patterns of policy activity and increasing sophistication in the evolution of smoke-free spaces policy development. This finding held for analyses by article, journal, and author over all years. The analysis also revealed relatively high numbers of unique authors publishing on smoke-free spaces policy each year. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified patterns regarding the publication of scientific articles, by varying journals and authors, and illustrated sub-field priorities both recently and for the entire 20-year period examined.	0
9072457	alpha1-Adrenoceptor subtypes mediating the contraction of arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 1. This study was undertaken to determine which alpha1-adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes were involved in the activation of the femoral artery and the aorta by norepinephrine (NE) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Negative log EC50 values and maximum responses of NE-induced contraction of the SHR femoral artery were unchanged and increased, respectively, compared with those of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. 3. Contractile responses of the SHR aortas to NE were similar to those of the normotensive tissues. 4. Schild plot data for alpha1-AR antagonists indicated that alpha1-AR in the aorta were predominantly alpha1H subtype. In the femoral artery, because Schild plots for bunazosin had slopes of less than 1.0, there were alpha1H (or alpha1C) and alpha1L subtypes. 5. The alpha1-AR subtype in the aorta was essentially identical to the alpha1H subtype in the femoral artery. alpha1-AR subtypes mediating contraction in the SHR blood vessels were identical to those in the WKY tissues.	0
18074618	Pheromone binding and inactivation by moth antennae. The antennae of male silk moths are extremely sensitive to the female sex pheromone such that a male moth can find a female up to 4.5 km away. This remarkable sensitivity is due to both the morphological and biochemical design of these antennae. Along the branches of the plumose antennae are the sensilla trichodea, each consisting of a hollow cuticular hair containing two unbranched dendrites bathed in a fluid, the receptor lymph ,3. The dendrites and receptor lymph are isolated from the haemolymph by a barrier of epidermal cells which secreted the cuticular hair. Pheromone molecules are thought to diffuse down 100 A-wide pore tubules through the cuticular wall and across the receptor lymph space to receptors located in the dendritic membrane. To prevent the accumulation of residual stimulant and hence sensory adaptation, the pheromone molecules are subsequently inactivated in an apparent two-step process of rapid 'early inactivation' followed by much slower enzymatic degradation. The biochemistry involved in this sequence of events is largely unknown. We report here the identification of three proteins which interact with the pheromone of the wild silk moth Antheraea polyphemus: a pheromone-binding protein and a pheromone-degrading esterase, both uniquely located in the pheromone-sensitive sensilla; and a second esterase common to all cuticular tissues except the sensilla.	0
10444194	Preliminary assessment of whole-blood, red-cell and platelet- leucodepleting filters for possible induction of prion release by leucocyte fragmentation during room temperature processing. Universal leucodepletion is being introduced in the U.K. to reduce a theoretical risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) transmission. If CJD infectivity is associated with leucocytes, any cell fragmentation associated with filtration could reduce the potential benefit. Four types each of whole blood, red cell and platelet leucodepletion filters were assessed after holding of blood units for at least 4 h at 22 degrees C. In all cases the mean residual leucocyte content was <1 000 000 per unit, with only two individual filtered whole blood units having a leucocyte content exceeding this. Evidence of leucocyte fragmentation during filtration was sought but not found by assay of soluble elastase, beta-thromboglobulin and normal prion protein, as well as by isotopic labelling of leucocyte external membrane. These preliminary studies indicate that it was possible to prepare leucodepleted blood components by filtration at room temperature, and that this appeared not to be associated with overt cell fragmentation. Definitive demonstration that fragmentation does not occur requires the development of improved general (non-specific) assays for cell membrane fragments.	0
16958618	Hypoxia-induced assembly of prolyl hydroxylase PHD3 into complexes: implications for its activity and susceptibility for degradation by the E3 ligase Siah2. PHD1-3 (prolyl hydroxylases 1-3) catalyse the hydroxylation of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor)-alpha subunit that triggers the substrate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The RING (really interesting new gene) finger E3 ligase Siah2 preferentially targets PHD3 for degradation. Here, we identify the requirements for such selective targeting. Firstly, PHD3 lacks an N-terminal extension found in PHD1 and PHD2; deletion of this domain from PHD1 and PHD2 renders them susceptible to degradation by Siah2. Secondly, PHD3 can homo- and hetero-multimerize with other PHDs. Consequently, PHD3 is found in high-molecular-mass fractions that were enriched in hypoxia. Interestingly, within the lower-molecular-mass complex, PHD3 exhibits higher specific activity towards hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha and co-localizes with Siah2, suggesting that Siah2 limits the availability of the more active form of PHD3. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism underlying the regulation of PHD3 availability and activity in hypoxia by the E3 ligase Siah2.	0
10064356	Coronary arteries bypass grafting with use of both internal thoracic arteries. The internal thoracic artery is a preferred conduit for bypass grafting. While the single ITA grafting has been universally accepted -- the use of both ITA's remains controversial. The risk factors analysis based upon assessment of operative results and mid-term functional follow-up was performed. The clinical applicability of transthoracic B-mode ultrasonic imaging and Doppler spectrum analysis in the postoperative evaluation of use of two ITA's was investigated. From January 1989 to January 1993, 97 patients received bilateral ITA and additional vein or RGEA grafts at Groby Road Hospital, Leicester, UK. There were 77 men (79.4%) and 20 women (20.6%) with mean age of 52.1+/-10.1 years. 19 cases were urgent. 14.4% of patients suffered from diabetes mellitus, 8.3% -- COAD and 46.6% did not work because of angina. The average number of anastomoses per patient was 3. The operative mortality was 4.1%. Complications included: reoperation for bleeding=3.2%, sternal infection=6.5%, IABP=2.1%. There were no evidence of perioperative myocardial infarction. 80 patients were followed-up for 26,5+/-13 months. 49 patients were in angina NYHA class I while preoperatively: 7. 1 patient was in NYHA class III while preoperatively there were 40 patients. Nearly twice more patients worked, and more than three times fewer patients did not worked because of angina, comparing to preoperative period. With the use of colour Doppler technique the blood flow was measured in 78.3% of left and 74% of right ITA's. The average flow in left ITA was: 46.4+/-17 ml/min and 41.7+/-17 ml/min in right ITA. The multivariate analysis for risk factors of bilateral ITA's grafting was performed. There were no risk factors for postoperative complications of bilateral internal thoracic arteries grafting in presented material. The risk of perioperative death is higher for patients with triple vessels disease than for patients with double vessels disease. Bilateral ITA grafting procedure has positive influence on patients working abilities. Percutaneous ultrasonic assessment of flow in ITA's used for bypass appears to be useful non-invasive investigation of their function.	0

19536904	Vinflunine in platinum-pretreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma: results of a large phase 2 study. BACKGROUND: The activity and safety of vinflunine was evaluated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who developed disease progression within 12 months of platinum-containing chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients with UC were eligible if they received a prior platinum-based regimen in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting or as first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic disease and had developed disease progression within 12 months. Vinflunine was administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients with Karnofsky performance status of 80 or 90, impaired renal function, prior pelvic irradiation, or age>or=75 years received an initial dose of 280 mg/m2, which was escalated to 320 mg/m2 in Cycle 2 if well tolerated. All other patients received an initial dose of 320 mg/m2. The primary endpoint was response rate defined by an independent response review committee (IRRC). RESULTS: Per the IRRC, 22 patients achieved a partial response, with a response rate of 15% (95% confidence interval, 9%-21%) with a median duration of response of 6.0 months. Sixty-four (42%) patients had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 2.8 months, and the median overall survival was 8.2 months. Myelosuppression was the most frequent adverse event, with grade 3 of 4 (adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] guidelines) neutropenia reported in 58% of the patients. Grade 3 of 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 10 (7%) patients. Nonhematologic treatment-related events (grade 3 of 4) were generally manageable and included constipation (17%), asthenia/fatigue (13%), ileus (5%), and abdominal pain (5%). No cumulative toxicity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Vinflunine demonstrates moderate activity in patients with platinum-pretreated UC. Toxicity is manageable and noncumulative.	0
11319082	Sequence analysis of insecticidal genes from Xenorhabdus nematophilus PMFI296. Three strains of Xenorhabdus nematophilus showed insecticidal activity when fed to Pieris brassicae (cabbage white butterfly) larvae. From one of these strains (X. nematophilus PMFI296) a cosmid genome library was prepared in Escherichia coli and screened for oral insecticidal activity. Two overlapping cosmid clones were shown to encode insecticidal proteins, which had activity when expressed in E. coli (50% lethal concentration [LC(50)] of 2 to 6 microg of total protein/g of diet). The complete sequence of one cosmid (cHRIM1) was obtained. On cHRIM1, five genes (xptA1, -A2, -B1, -C1, and -D1) showed homology with up to 49% identity to insecticidal toxins identified in Photorhabdus luminescens, and also a smaller gene (chi) showed homology to a putative chitinase gene (38% identity). Transposon mutagenesis of the cosmid insert indicated that the genes xptA2, xptD1, and chi were not important for the expression of insecticidal activity toward P. brassicae. One gene (xptA1) was found to be central for the expression of activity, and the genes xptB1 and xptC1 were needed for full activity. The location of these genes together on the chromosome and therefore present on a single cosmid insert probably accounted for the detection of insecticidal activity in this E. coli clone. Although multiple genes may be needed for full activity, E. coli cells expressing the xptA1 gene from the bacteriophage lambda P(L) promoter were shown to have insecticidal activity (LC(50) of 112 microg of total protein/g of diet). This is contrary to the toxin genes identified in P. luminescens, which were not insecticidal when expressed individually in E. coli. High-level gene expression and the use of a sensitive insect may have aided in the detection of insecticidal activity in the E. coli clone expressing xptA1. The location of these toxin genes and the chitinase gene and the presence of mobile elements (insertion sequence) and tRNA genes on cHRIM1 indicates that this region of DNA represents a pathogenicity island on the genome of X. nematophilus PMFI296.	0

8944644	Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport, Na+/H+ exchange, and cell volume in ferret erythrocytes. Ferrets have high-Na+ and low-K+ erythrocytes (113 and 5.4 mmol/l cell water) due to the lack of Na(+)-K+ pumps. Because ferret erythrocytes have a high capacity for Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport, the present study was undertaken to evaluate cell volume-related changes in cotransport activity and its role in volume regulation. With cell shrinkage, Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport is activated about twofold. A large bumetanide-insensitive Na+ uptake component that has not yet been described is found in shrunken erythrocytes. Its inhibition by amiloride (concn inhibiting 50% of maximal response = 12 microM) and the Na+ dependence of amiloride-sensitive extracellular pH changes measured in cells suspended in hypertonic unbuffered medium indicate that this flux represents Na+/H+ exchange. Shrinkage activation of both transporters follows a time lag of approximately 3 min and also requires normal levels of ATP. ATP depletion inhibits Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport even at normal cell volume. Both transporters are partially inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and K252a, and activators of protein kinases A and C do not affect transport. Okadaic acid inhibition of protein phosphatases activates Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport to its maximal activity (same after shrinkage), but shrinkage and okadaic acid activation are not additive. In contrast, okadaic acid activates Na+/H+ exchange even in shrunken cells. These results indicate that cell shrinkage activates Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl- cotransport and Na+/H+ exchange probably by phosphorylation processes.	0
8021108	Tick-induced modulation of the host immune response. The tick-host-pathogen interface is characterised by complex immunological interactions. Host immune responses to tick infestation and infection with tick-borne pathogens involve cytokines, antibodies, complement and T lymphocyte regulatory and effector pathways. A successful host-parasite relationship is a balance between limiting the parasite by host defenses and the ability of the parasite to modulate, evade or restrict the host response. Hosts acquire immunological based resistance to tick infestation, which reduces engorgement, production of ova and viability. Salivary glands of ixodid ticks produce a complex array of immunogens and pharmacologically active molecules. Tick salivary gland derived material can modulate host cytokine, antibody and cell mediated immune responses. Both immunoregulatory and immune effector pathways of the host are suppressed. Tick feeding impairs the ability to develop a primary immune response to a thymic dependent immunogen. Lymphocytes obtained from tick infested hosts are reduced in their ability to proliferate in vitro to T lymphocyte mitogens, while responses to B lymphocyte polyclonal activators are unaltered. Normal macrophages and lymphocytes were exposed to female tick salivary gland extracts prepared daily during the course of engorgement. All extracts reduced lymphocyte responses to T cell mitogens and enhanced in vitro proliferation in the presence of a B lymphocyte mitogen. Macrophage elaboration of tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1 are significantly reduced in a differential manner. Production of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma by T lymphocytes is reduced. Tick modulation of the host immune response could enhance the ability of the arthropod to obtain a blood meal and facilitate pathogen transmission to an immunocompetent host.	0
20352385	Femoral head-neck junction deformity is related to osteoarthritis of the hip. BACKGROUND: Primary or idiopathic osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip has increasingly been attributed to the presence of presumably minor femoral or acetabular deformities that are not routinely identified. The alpha angle reflects one such deformity of the femoral neck and reflects a risk for femoroacetabular impingement, which in turn reportedly is associated with OA. If impingement is in fact associated with OA, then one might expect the mean alpha angle to be greater in patients with presumed idiopathic hip OA. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore compared the alpha angle among a group of elderly patients with idiopathic OA with that in a control group of elderly individuals without OA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured the alpha angles in 50 individuals (72 hips) with a mean age of 70 years (range, 60-84 years) with apparently idiopathic OA and compared their angles with those from a control group of 56 individuals without OA. The alpha angle was measured by means of radiographs of their hips using the Dunn view at 45 degrees flexion. RESULTS: The patients with OA had a greater percentage with abnormal alpha angles than did the normal subjects: 82% versus 30%, respectively. The mean alpha angle in the group with OA was larger than in the control subjects: 66.4 masculine (range, 28 degrees -108 degrees ) versus 48.1 masculine (range, 34 degrees -68 degrees ). CONCLUSIONS: Hips with presumably idiopathic OA had more abnormalities at the femoral head-neck junction than did the control hips without OA and may relate to the risk of OA developing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.	0

10525203	Cromakalim: embryonic effects and reduction of tolbutamide-induced dysmorphogenesis in vitro. Cromakalim is a K(+) channel opener that causes smooth muscle relaxation by activating ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels and producing membrane hyperpolarization. Cromakalim counteracts sulfonylurea-induced K(ATP) channel inhibition in adult cells, but little is known regarding its embryonic effects, alone or in combination with sulfonylureas. K(ATP) channels have been demonstrated in the embryo, but their role in normal and abnormal development is unknown. Early-somite mouse embryos were exposed for 24 hr in vitro to cromakalim at concentrations of 0 (Cntl), 1, 10, 100, 200, or 500 microM in 0.125% DMSO. Embryos were also exposed for 24 hr in vitro to a dysmorphogenic tolbutamide concentration (110 microg/ml) combined with a subdysmorphogenic concentration of cromakalim (1 microM). Embryos were evaluated for somite number, heart rate, malformations, and embryonic and yolk sac protein content. Embryos exposed to 1 microM cromakalim were similar to controls. Cromakalim exposure increased malformation rates at concentrations >/=200 microM, decreased heart rates at >/=10 microM, and decreased somite and protein values at 500 microM. Defects involved cranial neural tube, optic vesicle, heart, and somites. A malformation rate of 59% in embryos exposed to 110 microg/ml tolbutamide was reduced to 13% by adding 1 microM cromakalim to the culture medium. Heart rate, somite number, and protein values were also improved by combined exposure to cromakalim and tolbutamide compared with exposure to tolbutamide alone. These results support previous findings with diazoxide (K(+) channel opener) and chlorpropamide (sulfonylurea) and further suggest a potential role for K(ATP) channel effects in sulfonylurea-induced dysmorphogenesis.	0
15167867	Factors influencing maternal perception of uterine contractions. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess factors associated with perception of uterine contractions. STUDY DESIGN: A database of ambulatory uterine activity monitoring was examined. All patients having singleton pregnancies evaluated between March 1997 and March 2002 were eligible for analysis. Data were divided into 4 groups by maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI): lean (<20 kg/m(2)), normal (>or=20 to <25 kg/m(2)), overweight (>or=25 to <30 kg/m(2)), and obese (>or=30 kg/m(2)). The percentage of contractions perceived during observation was compared between groups. Variables interrogated included maternal weight and parity. Statistical analysis included t test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression. RESULTS: Data from 7808 patients (556,382 hr) were analyzed. A significant reduction in perception of contractions occurred with increasing BMI between each classification, P <.001. A significant reduction in perception of contractions was also noted between nulliparous and multiparous patients at each weight classification, P <.001. CONCLUSION: Obese, nulliparous patients have the greatest difficulty perceiving contractions. Such data may help explain unattended birth or late presentation for care in this group.	0
21182268	Double-threaded dimer and supramolecular oligomer formed by stilbene modified cyclodextrin: effect of acyl migration and photostimuli. We observed changing supramolecular structures of stilbene-a-cyclodextrin (StiO-a-CD) by photoirradiation and migration. Stilbene derivatives show photoinduced isomerization under irradiation with    = 340 nm to give 2-cis-StiO-a-CD and with    = 254 nm to give 2-trans-StiO-a-CD. Photoisomerization of StiO-a-CD shows the photostationary state during 30 min. 2D NMR and diffusion coefficient studies revealed that 2-trans-StiO-a-CD forms a double-threaded dimer but 2-cis-StiO-a-CD changes to a supramolecular oligomer by photoirradiation. We found that the mutual migration of a stilbene group (StiO) on a-CD occurs under neutral conditions. The StiO group of a-CD (StiO-a-CD) moves between the C2 and C3 positions on the secondary hydroxyl group of StiO-a-CD (the wider rim of a-CD) to give 3-trans-StiO-a-CD. 3-trans-StiO-a-CD forms a supramolecular oligomer, whereas 3-cis-StiO-a-CD changes to a double-threaded dimer, indicating that 3-StiO-a-CDs gives the opposite results in the supramolecular structures of 2-StiO-a-CDs. The thermal isomerization (migration) is very slow. It takes about 300 h to reach the equilibrium state. Moreover, the migration rate constant (k(trans3 > 2)) of the trans-StiO group from the C3 position to the C2 position of a-CD is faster than k(trans2 > 3) from the C2 position to the C3 position of a-CD. On the other hand, k(cis2 > 3) of the cis-StiO group from the C2 position to the C3 position of a-CD is faster than k(cis3 > 2) from the C3 position to the C2 position, meaning k(cis2 > 3) > k(cis3 > 2), which is the opposite result for k(trans3 > 2) > k(trans2 > 3). The formation of a stable double-threaded dimer would suppress the migration of the StiO group of StiO-a-CDs in aqueous solutions.	0
8828440	Onapristone and prostaglandin E2 induction of delivery in the rat in late pregnancy: a model for the analysis of cervical softening. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to develop a method to induce premature delivery in rats and to use this method to identify biochemical changes that are critical to cervical dilatation by comparison to changes that occur during term delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Rats were treated with antiprogestational agents onapristone or lilopristone in combination with prostaglandin E2 or estradiol on day 19 of pregnancy to induce delivery before term. Mechanical and biochemical changes of the isolated cervix were compared with changes found at term and in 20-day controls. RESULTS: Rats treated with a combination of onapristone and prostaglandin E2 were consistently delivered 25 hours after treatment began. The physical characteristics of the cervix of treated rats changed to match those of term cervices. The ratio of the small sulfated proteoglycan (decorin) to collagen changed on induction to match the ratio found at term. CONCLUSIONS: This induction protocol can be used to advance the time of delivery in rats, with the further advantage that the time of delivery can be accurately predicted. The data strengthen a proposed model in which the interaction of decorin and collagen is an important determinant of the biomechanical properties of the cervix during pregnancy.	0
20301980	Computing the unconscious. This essay examines the unconscious as modeled by cognitive science and compares it to the psychoanalytic unconscious. In making this comparison, the author underscores the important but usually overlooked fact that computational psychology and psychoanalytic theory are both varieties of posthumanism. He argues that if posthumanism is to advance a vision for our future that is no longer fixated on a normative image of the human, then its own normative claims about the primacy of Darwinian functioning must be disrupted and undermined through a renewed emphasis on its Freudian heritage.	0
22174013	Reconstruction of nuclear receptor network reveals that NR2E3 is a novel upstream regulator of ESR1 in breast cancer. ESR1 is one of the most important transcription factors and therapeutic targets in breast cancer. By applying systems-level re-analysis of publicly available gene expression data, we uncovered a potential regulator of ESR1. We demonstrated that orphan nuclear receptor NR2E3 regulates ESR1 via direct binding to the ESR1 promoter with concomitant recruitment of PIAS3 to the promoter in breast cancer cells, and is essential for physiological cellular activity of ESR1 in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover, expression of NR2E3 was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival and a favourable response to tamoxifen treatment in women with ER-positive breast cancer. Our results provide mechanistic insights on the regulation of ESR1 by NR2E3 and the clinical relevance of NR2E3 in breast cancer.	1

17941740	Metabolic fate of [(14)C]-2,4-dichlorophenol in tobacco cell suspension cultures. In plant tissues, xenobiotics often are conjugated with natural constituents such as sugars, amino acids, glutathione, and malonic acid. Usually, conjugation processes result in a decrease in the reactivity and toxicity of xenobiotics by increasing the water solubility and polarity of conjugates, and reducing their mobility. Due to their lack of an efficient excretory system, xenobiotic conjugates finally are sequestered in plant storage compartments or cell vacuoles, or are integrated as bound residues in cell walls. Chlorophenols are potentially harmful pollutants that are found in numerous natural and agricultural systems. We studied the metabolic fate of 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) in cell-suspension cultures of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). After a standard metabolism experiment, 48 h of incubation with a [U-phenyl-(14)C]-DCP solution, aqueous extracts of cell suspension cultures were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Metabolites then were isolated and their chemical structures determined by enzymatic and chemical hydrolyses, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry in negative mode (ESI-NI), and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. The main terminal metabolites identified were DCP-glycoside conjugates, DCP-(6-O-malonyl)-glucoside, DCP-(6-O-acetyl)-glucoside, and their precursor, DCP-glucoside. More unusual and complex DCP conjugates such as an alpha(1-->6)-glucosyl-pentose and a triglycoside containing a glucuronic acid were further characterized. All the metabolites identified were complex glycoside conjugates. However, these conjugates still may be a source of DCP in hydrolysis reactions caused by microorganisms in the environment or in the digestive tract of animals and humans. Removal of xenobiotics by glycoside conjugation thus may result in underestimation of the risk associated with toxic compounds like DCP in the environment or in the food chain.	0
18681818	The 5-item mental health index predicts the initial diagnosis of nonfatal stroke in older women. BACKGROUND: Relatively little is known about psychosocial risk factors for the onset of stroke. The aim of this paper is to identify independent psychosocial risk factors for subsequent reported new diagnoses of stroke in older women. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of women initially aged between 70 and 75 years was first surveyed in 1996 and again in 1999. During this interval, from a final sample of 7839 participants, 174 women reported that a doctor had diagnosed them with stroke for the first time. A range of psychosocial risk factors measured in 1996 (life events, Mental Health Index [MHI-5], having a partner, Perceived Stress Scale, Duke Social Support Index, educational attainment, location of residence, feelings of time pressure) were entered into binary logistic regression models to examine which would predict the self-reported new diagnosis of stroke over the 3-year period after adjusting for a range of biomedical risk factors and the frequency of general practitioner visits in 1996. RESULTS: Only the MHI-5 proved to be a significant predictor of self-reported new stroke diagnosis. The MHI-5 remained a significant risk factor (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.55, p < 0.05) even after adjusting for a range of other possible risk factors (body mass index, physical activity, alcohol status, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, nutritional risk) and frequency of general practitioner visits. CONCLUSIONS: Poor mental health appears to be a risk factor for the self-reported new diagnosis of stroke in older women. The 5-item MHI may be a useful instrument for researchers investigating the relationship between psychosocial variables and stroke in older women and for clinicians who wish to identify those at risk for stroke.	0

20066157	The challenge of AIDS-related malignancies in sub-Saharan Africa. BACKGROUND: With the lengthening of life expectancy among HIV-positive subjects related to the use of highly active antiretroviral treatments, an increased risk of cancer has been described in industrialized countries. The question is to determine what occurs now and will happen in the future in the low income countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where more than two-thirds of all HIV-positive people live in the world. The objective of our paper is to review the link between HIV and cancer in sub-Saharan Africa, putting it in perspective with what is already known in Western countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies for this review were identified from several bibliographical databases including Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, Pascal, Web of Science and using keywords \"HIV, neoplasia, epidemiology and Africa\" and related MesH terms. A clear association was found between HIV infection and AIDS-classifying cancers. In case-referent studies, odds ratios (OR) were ranging from 21.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 12.5-38.6) to 47.1 (31.9-69.8) for Kaposi sarcoma and from 5.0 (2.7-9.5) to 12.6 (2.2-54.4) for non Hodgkin lymphoma. The association was less strong for invasive cervical cancer with ORs ranging from 1.1 (0.7-1.2) to 1.6 (1.1-2.3), whereas ORs for squamous intraepithelial lesions were higher, from 4.4 (2.3-8.4) to 17.0 (2.2-134.1). For non AIDS-classifying cancers, squamous cell conjunctival carcinoma of the eye was associated with HIV in many case-referent studies with ORs from 2.6 (1.4-4.9) to 13.0 (4.5-39.4). A record-linkage study conducted in Uganda showed an association between Hodgkin lymphoma and HIV infection with a standardized incidence ratio of 5.7 (1.2-17) although OR in case-referent studies ranged from 1.4 (0.7-2.8) to 1.6 (1.0-2.7). Other cancer sites found positively associated with HIV include lung, liver, anus, penis, vulva, kidney, thyroid and uterus and a decreased risk of female breast cancer. These results so far based on a relatively small number of studies warrant further epidemiological investigations, taking into account other known risk factors for these tumors. CONCLUSION: Studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa show that HIV infection is not only strongly associated with AIDS-classifying cancers but also provided some evidence of association for other neoplasia. African countries need now to implement well designed population-based studies in order to better describe the spectrum of AIDS-associated malignancies and the most effective strategies for their prevention, screening and treatment.	0
20407996	Obstructive sleep apnea indicators and injury in older farmers. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between sleep apnea indicators and injury in older farmers from Kentucky and South Carolina. Participants reported at least 1 day of farm work during the preceding year (n = 756) and received income from farming. The primary outcome variable was occurrence of injuries because of farm work in the past year. Main explanatory variables of interest included snoring, gasping, snorting, or cessation of breathing while asleep; trouble sleeping; consumption of sleep medications; trouble staying awake during daytime; and sleep quality. Simple logistic regressions established bivariate associations between explanatory and outcome variables. Explanatory variables significantly associated with the outcome in the bivariate analyses were used to fit a multivariable logistic regression model. The results show that just over 10% of participants experienced a farm injury in the past year. Significant bivariate associations were detected between the occurrence of injuries and number of days of farm work (odds ratio [OR] = 1.003, p = .0002); number of hours of farm work during the last week (OR = 1.017, p = .0047); male gender (OR = 2.48, p = .0007); arthritis or rheumatism conditions (OR = 1.981, p = .004); stopped breathing while sleeping (OR = 2.338, p = .0027); and problems staying awake during the past month (OR = 2.561, p = .001). In the final multivariable model, \"stopping breathing while asleep\" (p <or= .05) and \"problems staying awake last month\" (p <or= .01) were retained. These results show that sleep problems were associated with injury in this sample of older farmers. Future studies are necessary to screen and diagnose older farmers with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to empirically determine the effect of this sleep disorder on injury.	0
10157974	Satisfaction with HMOs. Accessibility issues top the list for patients in commercial groups. Most complaints about HMOs fall into three broad categories: quality of care, provider attitude, and accessibility to care. Of these, marketers should focus their efforts on the latter. Ensuring that subscribers understand their benefits can help reduce expectations and, therefore, dissatisfaction. Even though accessibility to care (as covered benefits) was very important in contributing to survey respondents' satisfaction with their health care, overall satisfaction did not affect a patient's decision to change physicians and only marginally affected the decision to change HMOs. In the member/provider relationship, the primary care physician may represent a barrier to benefits because he or she has the power to control access under the HMO structure.	0
11788929	Red blood cell hemolysis during processing. Red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis has been reported in units of RBC for transfusion. This has significant clinical implications for transfused patients because the free hemoglobin dissociates into dimers that have to be bound to haptoglobin to be removed by the reticuloendothelial system. Once the binding capacity of haptoglobin has been exceeded, hemoglobinemia occurs. Hemolysis is caused by the breakdown of the RBC, causing release of hemoglobin and resulting in the discoloration of the plasma. Abnormal hemolysis in an individual RBC unit may be caused by several factors including inappropriate handling during processing of blood, inappropriate storage conditions, bacterial hemolysins, antibodies that cause complement lysis, defects in the RBC membrane, or an abnormality in the blood donor. The degree of hemolysis is described as the percent of free hemoglobin in relation to the total hemoglobin with appropriate correction for the hematocrit. The acceptable level of hemolysis has not been established in North America, but the value of 1% currently is used to assess biocompatibility of blood storage materials, whereas the Council of Europe has set the standard at 0.8%. This report emphasizes the need for the adequate control of the various processes that are involved in the preparation of RBCs from whole blood to minimize the occurrence of hemolysis. Careful evaluation of manufacturing processes will minimize RBC wastage caused by hemolysis.	0
14554005	Genotype-specific responses of fluctuating asymmetry and of preadult survival to the effects of lead and temperature stress in Drosophila melanogaster. Although fluctuating asymmetry (FA) increases with exposure to certain types of environmental stressors such as temperature extremes, relatively little is known about the effects of interaction (e.g., synergism) between known sources of environmental stress on FA. Knowledge of such interaction effects, and of the magnitude of genotype-by-environment interaction, are of fundamental importance toward predicting the usefulness of FA as a bioindicator of environmental pollution. We tested for synergistic effects on FA between elevated temperature and exposure to lead, and examined FA responses simultaneously in four genetic strains of Drosophila melanogaster known to differ in their degree of developmental instability, and presumably in their buffering capacity. In the absence of heavy metal, bristle FA increased with temperature, but in the presence of lead, FA at high temperature (30 (degrees)C) was reduced to levels similar, or below, that at lower temperature (25 (degrees)C). This temperature by lead interaction was statistically significant, but paradoxical in that the disruptive effects of temperature appeared to be attenuated in the presence of the heavy metal. In no case was there a significant effect of lead on bristle FAs, despite documented assimilation of heavy metal by flies, and in no case was the genotype by environment interaction significant. Whereas lead treatment did not influence survival, survival was reduced at the high temperature, but significantly so only in one genetic strain (Oregon-R). There was no relationship between survival and FA across stress treatments within lines. Thus, any disproportionate stress-induced mortality in developmentally unstable classes (developmental selection) was unlikely to bias the FA results. Our results underscore the need for independent replication of significant findings before FA-based biomonitoring can be responsibly and effectively implemented. The results call for caution in using FA as a biomarker of stress, because stress factors may interact in complex and unpredictable ways, which could result in erroneous conclusions about real levels of stress present in field populations, under the unduly simplistic assumption that stress factors will act additively to increase FA.	0
22089559	Intense photoluminescence at 2.7  m in transparent Er 3+:CaF2-fluorophosphate glass microcomposite. Er3+ doped CaF2-fluorophosphate (FP) glass microcomposites were produced by heat-treating the mixture of Er3+:CaF2 precipitate and FP glass powder above the melting temperature of the FP glass. The appearance of CaF2 crystallites in the resulting composites was confirmed by x ray diffraction. Despite the fact that the average diameter of the crystallites was around 10  m as revealed by the micromorphology study, a transparent composite was obtained by matching the refractive index of FP glass to that of CaF2. Intense IR fluorescence at around 2.7  m was observed in the composite, implying the composite would be a promising candidate for IR lasers and amplifiers.	0
18211971	High serum inhibin concentration discriminates autoimmune oophoritis from other forms of primary ovarian insufficiency. CONTEXT: Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined by hypergonadotropic amenorrhea occurring before the age of 40 yr. In 4-5% of women with POI, an ovarian autoimmune process can be demonstrated. DESIGN: We have determined the serum concentrations of total inhibin and inhibin B by sensitive ELISAs in 22 women with autoimmune POI (aPOI), 71 women with non-autoimmune idiopathic POI (iPOI), 77 postmenopausal women, and 90 healthy, fertile women (HW). Diagnosis of aPOI was made according to the presence of steroid cell autoantibodies and/or 17alpha-hydroxylase autoantibodies and/or cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage autoantibodies. All aPOI patients were also positive for adrenal autoantibodies. RESULTS: Total inhibin levels were significantly higher in women with aPOI (median, 281 pg/ml) than in women with iPOI (median, 74 pg/ml) or HW (median, 133.5 pg/ml) (P < 0.001). Levels of inhibin B were also significantly higher in women with aPOI (median, 109 pg/ml) than in women with iPOI (median, 18 pg/ml) (P < 0.001) or HW (median, 39 pg/ml) (P < 0.05). Serum concentrations of total inhibin and inhibin B were significantly higher in women with POI than in postmenopausal women (P < 0.001), irrespective of the presence/absence of autoantibodies. At receiver-operating characteristic analysis, cutoff values of 133 pg/ml for total inhibin and 60.5 pg/ml for inhibin B ensured 86.4% sensitivity and 81-84.5% specificity for aPOI vs. iPOI. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a variable degree of ovarian function is preserved in women with POI and that aPOI is characterized by increased inhibin production resulting from a selective theca cell destruction, with initial preservation of granulosa cells.	0
12490999	[Active life expectancy: concepts and a new model approach]. The question about an increasing health burden due to the ongoing aging process of the population has been discussed in the scientific community for a very long time. The concept of active life expectancy seems to be a suitable instrument to test the controversial perceptions about compression or expansion of morbidity in old age. A new model is proposed and described based on the Sullivan method which does not quantify the change in active life expectancy at a certain age, as is common practice. In fact a new model, which measures the difference in active life expectancy at a specific general remaining life expectancy over time (DRALE model), seems to be much more appropriate. Thus cohort effects can be excluded. Finally, possible restrictions in the course of an empirical testing are presented and discussed. Main restrictions are the increasing heterogeneity of aging populations, the availability of appropriate data, and the high variance of raw data in old age.	0
15367687	The hinge-helix 1 region of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma1 (PPARgamma1) mediates interaction with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 and PPARgamma1 transcriptional activation: involvement in flow-induced PPARgamma activation in endothelial cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are ligand-activated transcription factors that form a subfamily of the nuclear receptor gene family. Since both flow and PPARgamma have atheroprotective effects and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) kinase activity is significantly increased by flow, we investigated whether ERK5 kinase regulates PPARgamma activity. We found that activation of ERK5 induced PPARgamma1 activation in endothelial cells (ECs). However, we could not detect PPARgamma phosphorylation by incubation with activated ERK5 in vitro, in contrast to ERK1/2 and JNK, suggesting a role for ERK5 as a scaffold. Endogenous PPARgamma1 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous ERK5 in ECs. By mammalian two-hybrid analysis, we found that PPARgamma1 associated with ERK5a at the hinge-helix 1 region of PPARgamma1. Expressing a hinge-helix 1 region PPARgamma1 fragment disrupted the ERK5a-PPARgamma1 interaction, suggesting a critical role for hinge-helix 1 region of PPARgamma in the ERK5-PPARgamma interaction. Flow increased ERK5 and PPARgamma1 activation, and the hinge-helix 1 region of the PPARgamma1 fragment and dominant negative MEK5beta significantly reduced flow-induced PPARgamma activation. The dominant negative MEK5beta also prevented flow-mediated inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation and adhesion molecule expression, including vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin, indicating a physiological role for ERK5 and PPARgamma activation in flow-mediated antiinflammatory effects. We also found that ERK5 kinase activation was required, likely by inducing a conformational change in the NH(2)-terminal region of ERK5 that prevented association of ERK5 and PPARgamma1. Furthermore, association of ERK5a and PPARgamma1 disrupted the interaction of SMRT and PPARgamma1, thereby inducing PPARgamma activation. These data suggest that ERK5 mediates flow- and ligand-induced PPARgamma activation via the interaction of ERK5 with the hinge-helix 1 region of PPARgamma.	0

15333483	Temporary preservation of beta-cell function by diazoxide treatment in childhood type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of diazoxide, an ATP-sensitive K(+) channel opener and inhibitor of insulin secretion, on beta-cell function and remission in children at clinical onset of type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 56 subjects (21 girls and 35 boys, age 7-17 years) were randomized to 3 months of active treatment (diazoxide 5-7.5 mg/kg in divided doses) or placebo in addition to multiple daily insulin injections and were followed for 2 years. RESULTS: Diazoxide decreased circulating C-peptide concentrations by approximately 50%. After cessation of the treatment, basal and meal-stimulated C-peptide concentrations increased to a maximum at 6 months, followed by a decline. Meal-stimulated C-peptide concentration was significantly higher at 12 months (0.43 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.31 +/- 0.26 nmol/l, P = 0.018) and tended to fall less from clinical onset to 24 months in the diazoxide- vs. placebo-treated patients (-0.05 +/- 0.24 vs. -0.18 +/- 0.26 nmol/l, P = 0.064). At 24 months, the meal-stimulated C-peptide concentrations were 0.24 +/- 0.20 and 0.20 +/- 0.17 nmol/l, respectively. Side effects of diazoxide were prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that partial inhibition of insulin secretion for 3 months at onset of childhood type 1 diabetes suspends the period of remission and temporarily preserves residual insulin production. Further evaluation of the full potential of beta-cell rest will require compounds with less side effects as well as protocols optimized for sustained secretory arrest.	0
12941044	Comparative effects of two synthetic oligosaccharides on platelet activation induced by plasma from HIT patients. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious secondary event encountered in the clinical use of heparin. HIT results from the consumption of platelets that are immunologically activated by antibodies directed against complexes formed by platelet factor 4 (PF4) and sulfated polysaccharides that activate platelet aggregation, leading to paradoxical, life-threatening thrombosis. There is strong evidence that the ability of heparin and related compounds to induce HIT is closely linked to the structure of the polysaccharide, and particularly to its negative charge and to the length of the molecule. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized two sulfated oligosaccharides: SanOrg123781, a 16-mer, presenting two terminal charged domains separated by a 7-mer neutral linker, and SR121903, a highly sulfated 17-mer. Both of them displayed strong anti-factor (F) Xa and anti-FIIa activities but their affinities for PF4 were markedly different. SR121903 displaced PF4-bound heparin, whereas SanOrg123781 did not, underlining the importance of the charge of the molecule for the interaction with PF4. Platelet studies, in the presence of HIT serum, showed that SR121903 induced the secretion of platelet-dense granules (measured by the release of serotonin) whereas SanOrg123781 did not, a result in accordance with an absence of affinity of this molecule for PF4. These results were confirmed by measurements of platelet activation by flow cytometry (measured by annexin V binding, CD62 detection and activation of the GpIIb-IIIa complexes). In conclusion, we have demonstrated the importance of the charge of the polysaccharides in the HIT-induced platelet reactions measured by diverse methods, of which some are described for this purpose for the first time.	0
23981548	Relationship between ambient fine particles and ventricular repolarization changes and heart rate variability of elderly people with heart disease in Beijing, China. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of particulate matters less than 2.5  m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) on heart repolarization/depolarization and heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: We conducted a panel study for elderly subjects with heart disease in Beijing from 2007 to 2008. PM2.5 was measured at a fixed station for 20 h continuously each day while electrocardiogram (ECG) indexes of 42 subjects were also recorded repeatedly. Meteorological data was obtained from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. A mixed linear regression model was used to estimate the associations between PM2.5 and the ECG indexes. The model was adjusted for age, body mass index, sex, day of the week and meteorology. RESULTS: Significant adverse effects of PM2.5 on ECG indexes reflecting HRV were observed statistically and the strongest effect of PM2.5 on HRV was on lag 1 day in our study. However, there were no associations between PM2.5 and ECG indexes reflecting heart repolarization/depolarization. Additionally, the effects of PM2.5 on subjects with hypertension were larger than on the subjects without hypertension. CONCLUSION: This study showed ambient PM2.5 could affect cardiac autonomic function of the elderly people with heart disease, and subjects with hypertension appeared to be more susceptive to the autonomic dysfunction induced by PM2.5.	0
17949145	Vibrational lifetimes of cyanide and carbon monoxide on noble and transition metal surfaces. The electronic vibrational damping rates of the CN and CO internal stretch modes on the (111) surfaces of Ag, Cu, Au, and Pt were calculated using density functional theory calculations. Our calculated damping rates are in excellent agreement with experimental data obtained from pump-probe laser spectroscopy. The striking difference in trends and magnitudes between the internal stretch modes of CN and CO is in part rationalized in terms of the adsorbate-induced electronic structure within the framework of a simple Newns-Anderson model.	0
20424392	Development of in situ hybridization for the detection of Mycoplasma hyorhinis in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from naturally infected pigs with polyserositis. The aim of this study was to develop in situ hybridization for detection of Mycoplasma hyorhinis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded tissues from pigs with polyserositis. M. hyorhinis was isolated from the spleen (2 pigs) and pericardium (1 pig). M. hyorhinis DNA was detected 16 out of 20 pigs with polyserositis. In situ hybridization produced a distinct positive signal for the M. hyorhinis p37 gene in inflammatory cells in the polyserositis. In situ hybridization developed in the present study present diagnostic tools capable of detection of M. hyorhinis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded tissues from the naturally infected pigs.	0

23571107	The ras-GTPase activity of neurofibromin restrains ERK-dependent FGFR signaling during endochondral bone formation. The severe defects in growth plate development caused by chondrocyte extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) gain or loss-of-function suggest that tight spatial and temporal regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling is necessary to achieve harmonious growth plate elongation and structure. We provide here evidence that neurofibromin, via its Ras guanosine triphosphatase -activating activity, controls ERK1/2-dependent fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling in chondrocytes. We show first that neurofibromin is expressed in FGFR-positive prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes during growth plate endochondral ossification. Using mice lacking neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) in type II collagen-expressing cells, (Nf1col2(-/-) mutant mice), we then show that lack of neurofibromin in post-mitotic chondrocytes triggers a number of phenotypes reminiscent of the ones observed in mice characterized by FGFR gain-of-function mutations. Those include dwarfism, constitutive ERK1/2 activation, strongly reduced Ihh expression and decreased chondrocyte proliferation and maturation, increased chondrocytic expression of Rankl, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) and Mmp13 and enhanced growth plate osteoclastogenesis, as well as increased sensitivity to caspase-9 mediated apoptosis. Using wildtype (WT) and Nf1(-/-) chondrocyte cultures in vitro, we show that FGF2 pulse-stimulation triggers rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both genotypes, but that return to the basal level is delayed in Nf1(-/-) chondrocytes. Importantly, in vivo ERK1/2 inhibition by daily injection of a recombinant form of C-type natriuretic peptide to post-natal pups for 18 days was able to correct the short stature of Nf1col2(-/-) mice. Together, these results underscore the requirement of neurofibromin and ERK1/2 for normal endochondral bone formation and support the notion that neurofibromin, by restraining RAS-ERK1/2 signaling, is a negative regulator of FGFR signaling in differentiating chondrocytes.	0

9223672	CBP/p300 as a co-factor for the Microphthalmia transcription factor. The Microphthalmia basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-Leucine Zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factor (Mi) plays a crucial role in the genesis of melanocytes; mice deficient for a functional (Microphthalmia) gene product lack all pigment cells. We show here that the Mi activation domain resides N-terminal to the DNA-binding domain and that as little as 18 amino acids are sufficient to mediate transcription activation. The minimal activation region of Mi is highly conserved in the related transcription factor TFE3 and is predicted to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. This region of Mi is also highly conserved with a region of E1A known to be essential for binding the CBP/p300 transcription cofactor. Consistent with these observations, the Mi activation domain can interact in vitro with CBP specifically through a region of CBP required for complex formation with E1A, P/CAF and c-Fos, and anti p300 antibodies can co-immunoprecipitate Mi from both melanocyte and melanoma cell lines. In addition, co-transfection of a vector expressing CBP2 (aas 1621-1891) fused to the VP16 activation domain potentiated the ability of Mi to activate transcription, confirming the significance of the CBP-Mi interaction observed in vitro. These data suggest that transcription activation by Mi is achieved at least in part by recruitment of CBP. The parallels between transcription regulation by Microphthalmia in melanocytes and MyoD in muscle cells are discussed.	0
22605668	Older age is associated with higher rate of discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. BACKGROUND: In increasingly aging populations, awareness of outcomes of older patients treated with biologics is becoming more important. However, few studies to date have investigated the safety and durability of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in this subgroup. METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study with cases comprising all IBD patients who began anti-TNF treatment at age >60 years. Cases of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were identified from medical record review. Our controls consisted of patients younger than age 60 years on anti-TNF treatment and patients >60 years on treatment with immunomodulators. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to calculate the probability of remaining on anti-TNF therapy. RESULTS: We identified a total of 54 IBD patients who initiated anti-TNF therapy over the age of 60 years (mean 73, range 61-97 years). Among these, a total of 38 patients (70%) discontinued anti-TNF therapy after a mean of 24.1 months. At 12 months after initiation, 75% of patients older than age 60 years were still on anti-TNF agents compared to 93% among younger users and 82% among older AZA users (P < 0.05). Compared to older AZA users, older anti-TNF users remained more likely to require early therapy cessation (hazard ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.29-3.78). CONCLUSIONS: The IBD population older than age 60 at the time of initiation of anti-TNF therapy is at higher risk for discontinuation of therapy. They may also be particularly vulnerable to infectious complications requiring hospitalization, suggesting the need for careful monitoring during therapy.	0
10321782	Postparotidectomy fistula: a different treatment for an old problem. There is little consensus on the optimal management of postparotidectomy salivary fistulas. Timely treatment is important since fistulas may result in wound dehiscence and infection. Management options include pressure dressings, total parotidectomy, tympanic neurectomy, graft interpositioning, surgical closure of the tract, radiation therapy, and pharmacotherapy. Unfortunately, many therapies require weeks to months for resolution and possess additional risks. The affected patient often suffers social embarrassment from the drainage. Through our work with neurologically impaired children with sialorrhea, we have had success with using glycopyrrolate, an anticholinergic frequently used to decrease salivary secretions. We present a case of a patient with a postparotidectomy fistula which was successfully treated with glycopyrrolate and pressure dressings. The rationale and potential use of glycopyrrolate for the treatment of a salivary fistula are the focus of this presentation.	0

11902340	Increased expression of fas ligand in human tuberculosis and leprosy lesions: a potential novel mechanism of immune evasion in mycobacterial infection. To study the location and mechanism of apoptosis within the human tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy lesions, parallel sections were analyzed for mycobacterial antigens (M.Ag), Fas ligand (FasL), Fas, CD68 and Mac387 by immunohistochemistry, and apoptotic cells by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labelling method. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and foreign body granulomas were analyzed for comparison. The heavily infected macrophages in multibacillary TB and leprosy granulomas very strongly expressed FasL, indicating that a mycobacterial infection can induce an increased expression of FasL in a population of infected macrophages, which may protect them from the attack of Fas-expressing lymphocytes. However, macrophages with high levels of leishmania amastigotes did not selectively express FasL, suggesting that this phenomenon is specific for the mycobacteria. Interestingly, in the well-formed TB granulomas, 84% of the multinucleated giant cells strongly expressed FasL. The expression of Fas was weak (34%) or absent. A higher number (33%) of epithelioid cells expressed FasL than Fas (23%). Lymphocytes were scanty among the epithelioid cells. The frequency of apoptotic cells was higher in the epithelioid cells (0.25%) than the mononuclear cells in the mantle zone (0.14%). Thus, the epithelioid cells and the multinucleated giant cells by virtue of the increased expression of FasL may make these granulomas an immune privileged site for mycobacteria.	0

8937444	Activation of the Na(+)-K+ pump in frog erythrocytes by catecholamines and phosphodiesterase blockers. K+ and Na+ influx into frog erythrocytes incubated in standard saline was studied using 86Rb and 22Na as tracers. 10 microM isoproterenol (ISP) produced a significant increase in K+ influx for the first 15 min, which was sustained during the entire 60 min of cell incubation. Treatment of red cells with the phosphodiesterase (PDE) blockers theophylline (THEO, 1 and 5 mM) or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 0.5 mM) was also accompanied by an enhancement in K+ influx. A distinct additive effect on K+ influx into red cells was found when ISP and THEO or IBMX were added together. The increase in K+ transport induced by ISP plus IBMX was totally abolished by pretreatment of red cells with 0.1 mM ouabain. The ouabain-sensitive K+ influx in frog erythrocytes was elevated in the presence of ISP plus IBMX to 2.05 +/- 0.45, as compared with the control level of 0.39 +/- 0.11 mmol/L cells/hr (P < 0.001). Similar effects of ISP and IBMX on K+ influx were observed after chloride was replaced by nitrate. A dose-related increase in K+ influx into frog erythrocytes was observed at ISP concentrations of 10(-8)-10(-6) M, with a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of approximately 0.02 microM. The effects of ISP (10(-8)-10(-5) M) on K+ transport were completely abolished with 10 microM of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, but alpha-adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine, prazosin, and yohimbine) did not alter the ISP-induced increase in K+ influx. The drugs tested had no effect on 22Na influx in frog red cells, but ISP produced a small decline (13%) in intracellular Na+ concentration. Thus, our study indicates that catecholamines and PDE blockers enhance K+ (86Rb) transport in frog erythrocytes mediated by Na(+)-K+ pump activity. The frog erythrocyte membrane may serve as a convenient model to investigate the hormonal modulation of the Na(+)-K+.	0
11328083	Entanglement in cascaded-crystal parametric down-conversion. We use spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a cascade of crystals, driven by a single monochromatic cw pump laser, to study the interference of entangled photon pairs. By changing the distance between the crystals, the observed quantum interference pattern varies continuously from that associated with a longer single crystal to that associated with independent emissions from two distinct crystals. Postselection via spectral filtering suppresses this phenomenon. These findings are expected to advance the field of quantum-state engineering.	0

19104860	Synthesis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate using molecular sieve-immobilized lipase from Bacillus coagulans. Extracellular lipase from Bacillus coagulans BTS-3 was immobilized on (3 A x 1.5 mm) molecular sieve. The molecular sieve showed approximately 68.48% binding efficiency for lipase (specific activity 55 IU mg(-1)). The immobilized enzyme achieved approx 90% conversion of acetic acid and 4-nitrophenol (100 mM each) into 4-nitrophenyl acetate in n-heptane at 65 degrees C in 3 h. When alkane of C-chain length other than n-heptane was used as the organic solvent, the conversion of 4-nitrophenol and acetic acid was found to decrease. About 88.6% conversion of the reactants into ester was achieved when reactants were used at molar ratio of 1:1. The immobilized lipase brought about conversion of approximately 58% for esterification of 4-nitrophenol and acetic acid into 4-nitrophenyl acetate at a temperature of 65 degrees C after reuse for 5 cycles.	0
13130063	Gordonia paraffinivorans sp. nov., a hydrocarbon-degrading actinomycete isolated from an oil-producing well. The taxonomic position of an actinomycete, strain HD321(T), isolated from an oil-producing well of Daqing oilfield, was clarified using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The strain possessed cell-wall chemotype IV, MK-9(H(2)) as the predominant menaquinone, relatively long-chain mycolic acids (52-62 carbon atoms) of the Gordonia type, straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and tuberculostearic acid. The G+C content of the DNA was 66 mol%. 16S rDNA analyses as well as chemotaxonomic and physiological properties indicated that strain HD321(T) represents a novel species within the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia paraffinivorans sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is HD321(T) (=AS 4.1730(T)=DSM 44604(T)).	0

23711521	Performance of the xTAG   gastrointestinal pathogen panel, a multiplex molecular assay for simultaneous detection of bacterial, viral, and parasitic causes of infectious gastroenteritis. The xTAG(  ) Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (GPP) is a multiplexed molecular test for 15 gastrointestinal pathogens. The sensitivity and specificity of this test were assessed in 901 stool specimens collected from pediatric and adult patients at four clinical sites. A combination of conventional and molecular methods was used as comparator. Sensitivity could be determined for 12 of 15 pathogens and was 94.3% overall. The specificity across all 15 targets was 98.5%. Testing for the pathogen identified was not requested by the physician in 65% of specimens. The simultaneous detection of these 15 pathogens can provide physicians with a more comprehensive assessment of the etiology of diarrheal disease.	0

19169667	An improved Boussignac device for the delivery of non-invasive CPAP: the SUPER-Boussignac. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to describe and test a modified Boussignac system for non-invasive continuous positive airway pressure, aimed at reducing the decrease in inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO(2)) with higher inspiratory peak flow rates. METHODS: We modified a Boussignac circuit by inserting a T-piece between the Boussignac valve and the face mask. The T-piece was connected to a reservoir balloon receiving oxygen by an independent source. The system was tested in a bench study, consisting of five steps, with increasing inspiratory peak flow rates (V(insp)) Three levels of PEEP were tested: 7, 10 and 13 cmH(2)O. The following devices were tested: Boussignac, Boussignac with reservoir but without supplementary oxygen, Boussignac with reservoir and 10 (SUPER-Boussignac(10)) and 30 l/min (SUPER-Boussignac(30)) of supplementary oxygen. In each step we measured FiO(2), tidal volumes, and airway pressure. RESULTS: FiO(2) increased with PEEP and decreased at increasing V(insp) with all the systems. However, FiO(2) increased with SUPER-Boussignac(10) (7-10%) and with SUPER-Boussignac(30) (10-30%). Moreover, in the latter case, for V(insp) values up to 60 l/min, FiO(2) became independent of V(insp). The SUPER-Boussignac allowed also smaller drop in airway pressure during inspiration and higher tidal volumes. CONCLUSIONS: The SUPER-Boussignac represents a simple way to significantly improve the performance of the Boussignac device.	0
16822232	A new group of exo-acting family 28 glycoside hydrolases of Aspergillus niger that are involved in pectin degradation. The fungus Aspergillus niger is an industrial producer of pectin-degrading enzymes. The recent solving of the genomic sequence of A. niger allowed an inventory of the entire genome of the fungus for potential carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. By applying bioinformatics tools, 12 new genes, putatively encoding family 28 glycoside hydrolases, were identified. Seven of the newly discovered genes form a new gene group, which we show to encode exoacting pectinolytic glycoside hydrolases. This group includes four exo-polygalacturonan hydrolases (PGAX, PGXA, PGXB and PGXC) and three putative exo-rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases (RGXA, RGXB and RGXC). Biochemical identification using polygalacturonic acid and xylogalacturonan as substrates demonstrated that indeed PGXB and PGXC act as exo-polygalacturonases, whereas PGXA acts as an exo-xylogalacturonan hydrolase. The expression levels of all 21 genes were assessed by microarray analysis. The results from the present study demonstrate that exo-acting glycoside hydrolases play a prominent role in pectin degradation.	0
19135464	Memory and learning behavior in mice is temporally associated with diet-induced alterations in gut bacteria. The ability of dietary manipulation to influence learning and behavior is well recognized and almost exclusively interpreted as direct effects of dietary constituents on the central nervous system. The role of dietary modification on gut bacterial populations and the possibility of such microbial population shifts related to learning and behavior is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether shifts in bacterial diversity due to dietary manipulation could be correlated with changes in memory and learning. Five week old male CF1 mice were randomly assigned to receive standard rodent chow (PP diet) or chow containing 50% lean ground beef (BD diet) for 3 months. As a measure of memory and learning, both groups were trained and tested on a hole-board open field apparatus. Following behavioral testing, all mice were sacrificed and colonic stool samples collected and analyzed by automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and bacterial tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) approach for microbial diversity. Results demonstrated significantly higher bacterial diversity in the beef supplemented diet group according to ARISA and bTEFAP. Compared to the PP diet, the BD diet fed mice displayed improved working (P=0.0008) and reference memory (P<0.0001). The BD diet fed animals also displayed slower speed (P<0.0001) in seeking food as well as reduced anxiety level in the first day of testing (P=0.0004). In conclusion, we observed a correlation between dietary induced shifts in bacteria diversity and animal behavior that may indicate a role for gut bacterial diversity in memory and learning.	0
15002250	[Combined exposure to lead and cadmium in selected groups of people in Upper Silesia]. The aim of investigation was an assessment of potential combined exposure to lead and cadmium in selected groups of people in Upper Silesia. The employees of coal-mines, of smelting works, and non exposed occupationally population were investigated. The following groups of employees were distinguished: in coal-mines--miners (38 persons), workers on the surface of earth (77 persons), in smelting works--smelters (8 persons), accessory workers (37 persons), clerks (18 persons) and non-exposed occupationally groups (66 persons). Schema of investigation was based on the earlier elaborated model of combined exposure assessment and questionnaire results obtained from the examined groups. The levels of exposure were determined on the base of average values of concentration of lead and cadmium, obtained as results of monitoring occupational air, ambient air, drinking water, soil, diets, cigarettes, time of exposure, pulmonary ventilation, retention, and output of absorption efficiency. The highest absorbed doses of both metals were determined in smelters (4.5 mg Pb and 0.22 mg Cd) and in accessory workers (0.9 mg Pb and 0.029 mg Cd). Occupational exposure was the main origin of these doses. Diet and drinking water are the main exposure pathway in case of employees of coal-mines, who absorbed doses from 0.43-0.51 mg Pb, and 0.029-0.043 mg Cd. The significant sources of absorbed amounts of cadmium are cigarettes, which increase absorbed dose of cadmium from 0.016 mg in a group nonexposed occupationally to 0.035 mg in miners. Absorbed dose of lead in combine exposure by smelters only may be a result of adverse health effects.	0

17761926	Designing a message for public education regarding stroke: does FAST capture enough stroke? BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown poor public knowledge of stroke warning signs. The current public education message adopted by the American Heart Association lists 5 stroke warning signs (\"suddens\"). Another message called FAST (face, arm, speech, time) could be easier to remember, but it does not contain as many stroke symptoms. We sought to assess the percentage of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients identified by both public awareness messages by examining presenting symptoms of all stroke/TIA patients from a large, biracial population in 1999. METHODS: Cases of stroke who presented to an emergency department or were directly admitted were ascertained at all local hospitals by screening of ICD-9 codes 430 to 436, and prospective screening of emergency department admission logs, in 1999. Study nurses abstracted initial presenting symptoms from the medical record. All-cause 30-day case-fatality was calculated. RESULTS: During 1999, 3498 stroke/TIA patients (17% black, 56% female) presented to an emergency department. Of these events, 11.1% had presenting symptoms not included in FAST, whereas 0.1% had presenting symptoms not included in the suddens. The FAST message performed much better for ischemic stroke and TIA than for hemorrhage, missing 8.9% of the ischemic strokes and 8.2% of the TIAs, versus 30.6% of intracerebral hemorrhage/subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. Case-fatality in patients missed by FAST was similar to patients with FAST symptoms (9.0% versus 11.6%, P=0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Within our population, we found that the FAST message identified 88.9% of stroke/TIA patients. The FAST message performed better for ischemic stroke and TIA than for hemorrhagic stroke. Whether the FAST message is easier to recall for the public than the \"suddens\" message has yet to be determined.	0

21700720	Impaired FSHbeta expression in the pituitaries of Foxl2 mutant animals. Forkhead box L2 (FoxL2) is required for ovarian development and differentiation. FoxL2 is also expressed in the pituitary where it has been implicated in the development and regulation of gonadotropes, which secrete LH and FSH, the endocrine signals that regulate folliculogenesis in the ovary and spermatogenesis in the testis. Here, we show that FoxL2 is not required for the specification of gonadotropes; the pituitaries of Foxl2 mutant mice contain normal numbers of gonadotropes that express glycoprotein a subunit and LHb. Whereas the specification of gonadotropes and all other hormonal cell types is normal in the pituitaries of Foxl2 mutant animals, FSHb levels are severely impaired in both male and female animals, suggesting that FoxL2 is required for normal Fshb expression. The size of the pituitary is reduced in proportion to the smaller body size of Foxl2 mutants, with a concomitant increase in the pituitary cellular density. In primary pituitary cultures, activin induces FSH secretion and Fshb mRNA expression in cells from wild-type mice. In cells from Foxl2 mutant mice, however, FSH secretion is not detected, and activin is unable to drive Fshb expression, suggesting that the mechanism of activin-dependent activation of Fshb transcription is impaired. However, a small number of gonadotropes in the ventromedial region of the pituitaries from Foxl2 mutant mice maintain FSHb expression, suggesting that a FoxL2- and activin-independent mechanism can drive Fshb transcription. These data indicate that, in addition to its role in the ovary, FoxL2 function in the pituitary is required for normal expression of FSH.	1
17112061	[The research on preparing CeO2 nanocrystalline by homogeneous precipitation method]. CeO2 nanocrystallines were prepared by homogeneous complexed-precipitation method, using cerous nitrate and ammonium tartrate as raw materials. The effects of cerous tartrate complex compound and the way of producing precipitation on the particle size of samples were investigated. The samples were characterized by XRD, TEM and SEM. The SEM micrograph shows that the foam exhibits a perforated porousness stereostructure in shape, and the HRTEM picture of the particles reveals the clear crystal lattice. All the results indicate that the samples were CeO2 nanocrystalline.	0

22024752	Physical exercise stimulates autophagy in normal skeletal muscles but is detrimental for collagen VI-deficient muscles. Autophagy is a catabolic process that provides the degradation of altered/damaged organelles through the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Proper regulation of the autophagic flux is fundamental for the homeostasis of skeletal muscles in physiological conditions and in response to stress. Defective as well as excessive autophagy is detrimental for muscle health and has a pathogenic role in several forms of muscle diseases. Recently, we found that defective activation of the autophagic machinery plays a key role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies linked to collagen VI. Impairment of the autophagic flux in collagen VI null (Col6a1   /   ) mice causes accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and altered sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to apoptosis and degeneration of muscle fibers. Here we show that physical exercise activates autophagy in skeletal muscles. Notably, physical training exacerbated the dystrophic phenotype of Col6a1   /    mice, where autophagy flux is compromised. Autophagy was not induced in Col6a1   /    muscles after either acute or prolonged exercise, and this led to a marked increase of muscle wasting and apoptosis. These findings indicate that proper activation of autophagy is important for muscle homeostasis during physical activity.	0

18024752	Influence of dietary fat and protein on body composition of Jersey bull calves. Thirty-nine bull calves between 6 and 9 d of age, were assigned to either baseline slaughter or 1 of 4 diets to determine the influence of dietary fat and protein content, at 2 levels of intake, on growth and body composition changes. Calves were assigned to the following diets a 28.5% protein and 16.4% fat milk replacer [MR; 29/16 (n = 9)], 27.3% protein and 33.4% fat MR [27/33 (n = 8)], 20.6% protein and 20.6% fat MR [20/20 (8)], or whole milk [WM (n = 8)]. Calves fed 27/33, 29/16, and WM received 180 g/d of CP to support 650 g of ADG based on predictions from the 2001 NRC. Calves were fed 3 times daily for 4 wk. Weight, hip height, wither height, heart girth, and body length were measured weekly. Weekly plasma samples were analyzed for plasma urea nitrogen, nonesterified fatty acids, and glucose. A subset of calves from each treatment was killed [29/16 (n = 7), 27/33 (n = 6), 20/20 (n = 6), and WM (n = 5)] at the end of wk 4 of treatment; processed for whole-body analysis of fat, protein, ash, and DM; and compared with baseline slaughter calves to estimate composition of empty BW gain. Calves did not differ in average weekly scour score or medication days. Feed efficiency and ADG were greatest for calves fed WM and least for calves fed 20/20; calves fed 29/16 and 27/33 did not differ. Calves fed 27/33 or WM had the greatest % body fat and gained more grams of fat than calves fed other diets. Calves fed 29/16 or 20/20 had similar % fat in empty body as baseline. Differences in % CP, % ash, or % water in empty body and empty BW gain were not detected. Calves fed 27/33 had a trend toward higher NEFA in wk 1 and 2 than calves fed 29/16 or WM. Growth of calves fed 27/33 and 29/16 were similar except that calves fed 29/16 had lower body fat % than calves fed 27/33. Calves on all diets gained less than predicted by the 2001 NRC.	0
18811431	Reconciling classical and individual-based approaches in theoretical population ecology: a protocol for extracting population parameters from individual-based models. The two main approaches in theoretical population ecology-the classical approach using differential equations and the approach using individual-based modeling-seem to be incompatible. Linked to these two approaches are two different timescales: population dynamics and behavior or physiology. Thus, the question of the relationship between classical and individual-based approaches is related to the question of the mutual relationship between processes on the population and the behavioral timescales. We present a simple protocol that allows the two different approaches to be reconciled by making explicit use of the fact that processes operating on two different timescales can be treated separately. Using an individual-based model of nomadic birds as an example, we extract the population growth rate by deactivating all demographic processes-in other words, the individuals behave but do not age, die, or reproduce. The growth rate closely matches the logistic growth rate for a wide range of parameters. The implications of this result and the conditions for applying the protocol to other individual-based models are discussed. Since in physics the technique of separating timescales is linked to some concepts of self-organization, we believe that the protocol will also help to develop concepts of self-organization in ecology.	0
8336184	Intensively timed induction therapy followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for children with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome: a Childrens Cancer Group pilot study. PURPOSE: Childrens Cancer Group (CCG) protocol 2861 was designed to test the feasibility of aggressively timed induction therapy followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as the sole postremission therapy for newly diagnosed children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1988 and October 1989, 142 patients were eligible for study. All patients entered received a timing-intensive five-drug induction of dexamethasone, cytarabine (Ara-C), thioguanine, etoposide, and daunorubicin (DCTER) over 4 days with a second cycle administered after 6 days of rest, irrespective of hematologic status at that time. Most patients subsequently received a second two-cycle induction course. Those who achieved remission were eligible for bone marrow ablative therapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, followed by 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (4-HC)-purged autologous or allogeneic BMT rescue. RESULTS: One hundred eight (76%) patients achieved remission: 19 (13%) died of complications of the leukemia and/or chemotherapy, and 15 (11%) failed to achieve remission. Seventy-four patients subsequently underwent BMT with either autologous (n = 58) or allogeneic (n = 16) rescue. For patients who received autologous rescue with 4-HC-purged grafts, the actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 3 years from the day of transplant is 51%, compared with 55% for patients who received allogeneic grafts (P = .92). At 3 years, the overall actuarial survival rate for all 142 patients entered on this study is 45%, with an event-free survival (EFS) rate of 37%. Adverse prognostic factors for outcome included an elevated WBC count or the presence of CNS leukemia at the time of AML diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that aggressively timed induction therapy followed by marrow ablation and BMT rescue with either autologous or allogeneic grafts for children with newly diagnosed AML or MDS is both feasible and effective.	0

17191269	The effect of histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) on the incorporation of 32P (Pi) and 3H-palmitic acid into the phospholipids of Tetrahymena. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are able to control also the acetylation of tubulin. In the present experiments the effect of trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor was studied on the incorporation of 3H-palmitic acid and 32P to the phospholipids (PI, PIP, PS, PC, PA, PE) of Tetrahymena pyriformis, considering earlier observations on the microtubular system's influence on signalling in this unicellular eukaryote. Treatment with 1, 5, or 10 microM TSA was studied. The incorporation of hydrophobic tail component, palmitic acid was inhibited in a concentration dependent manner into all the phospholipids, except for PA, where the incorporation was increased. 32P incorporation was also inhibited. The possible relation between the microtubular system and signalling is discussed.	0
18447795	Evaluation of technetium Tc 99m-labeled biotin for scintigraphic detection of soft tissue inflammation in horses. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of technetium Tc 99m-labeled EDTA-biotin monomer ((99m)Tc-EB1) as a scintigraphic imaging agent for soft tissue inflammatory lesions in horses. ANIMALS: 6 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES: First (phase 1), the agent's safety and blood-tissue clearance and an appropriate imaging protocol were determined in 6 horses. Each horse was injected with (99m)Tc-EB1 (1.1 GBq, IV, once); images were acquired at intervals during the following 24-hour period. Subsequently (phase 2), inflammation was induced via injection of 200 mg (10 mL) of mepivacaine (0.4 mg/kg) into the right neck musculature and perineurally in the proximal palmar metacarpal region of the right forelimb of 2 horses. Six hours after mepivacaine injection, (99m)Tc-EB1 (2.2 GBq, IV, once) was administered; 8 hours after injection, comparative soft tissue images were acquired after administration of technetium (99m)Tc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate ((99m)Tc-HDP; 7.4 GBq, IV, once). RESULTS: After injections of (99m)Tc-EB1, physical examinations, CBCs, and serum biochemical analyses revealed no abnormalities in any horse. Blood clearance of (99m)Tc-EB1 was rapid (A phase, 2.2 minutes; beta phase, 58 minutes). Soft tissue uptake of (99m)Tc-EB1 was immediate and persisted for as long as 4 hours after injection. At 6 hours after IM and perineural mepivacaine injections, mepivacaine-induced inflammation was detectable by use of (99m)Tc-EB1. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results indicated that (99m)Tc-EB1 is safe for use in horses and can identify soft tissue inflammation without concurrent uptake in bone. Compared with (99m)Tc-HDP administration, use of (99m)Tc-EB1 extended the duration of soft tissue scintigraphic image acquisition.	0
21059856	Identification of a polyI:C-inducible membrane protein that participates in dendritic cell-mediated natural killer cell activation. In myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), TLR3 is expressed in the endosomal membrane and interacts with the adaptor toll/interleukin 1 receptor homology domain-containing adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1; TRIF). TICAM-1 signals culminate in interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 3 activation. Co-culture of mDC pretreated with the TLR3 ligand polyI:C and natural killer (NK) cells resulted in NK cell activation. This activation was triggered by cell-to-cell contact but not cytokines. Using expression profiling and gain/loss-of-function analyses of mDC genes, we tried to identify a TICAM-1-inducing membrane protein that participates in mDC-mediated NK activation. Of the nine candidates screened, one contained a tetraspanin-like sequence and satisfied the screening criteria. The protein, referred to as IRF-3-dependent NK-activating molecule (INAM), functioned in both the mDC and NK cell to facilitate NK activation. In the mDC, TICAM-1, IFN promoter stimulator 1, and IRF-3, but not IRF-7, were required for mDC-mediated NK activation. INAM was minimally expressed on NK cells, was up-regulated in response to polyI:C, and contributed to mDC-NK reciprocal activation via its cytoplasmic tail, which was crucial for the activation signal in NK cells. Adoptive transfer of INAM-expressing mDCs into mice implanted with NK-sensitive tumors caused NK-mediated tumor regression. We identify a new pathway for mDC-NK contact-mediated NK activation that is governed by a TLR signal-derived membrane molecule.	0
11808731	Investigation of the spectral properties of a squarylium near-infrared dye and its complexation with Fe(III) and Co(II) ions. The spectral features of the squarylium dye NN525 in different solutions and its complexation with several metal ions were investigated. The absorbance maximum of the dye is at 669 nm in tetrahydrofuran. This value matches the output of a commercially available laser diode (650 nm), thus making use of such a source practical for excitation. The emission maximum of the dye in tetrahydrofuran is at 676 nm. The addition of either Fe(III) ion or Co(II) ion resulted in fluorescence quenching of the dye. The detection limit is 6.24 x 10(-8) M for Fe(III) ion and 1.55 x 10(-8) M for Co(II) ion. The molar ratio of the metal to the dye was established to be 1:1 for both metal ions. The stability constant Ks of the metal-dye complex was calculated to be 3.14 x 10(6) M(-1) for the Fe-dye complex and 2.64 x 10(5) M(-1) for the Co-dye complex.	0
11270477	Evidence for a direct effect of melatonin on mitochondrial genome expression of Siberian hamster brown adipocytes. Photoperiod variations are known to participate in the regulation of energy balance in different rodent species via melatonin, a neurosecretory product synthesized by the pineal gland during the night. A direct effect of melatonin on adipose tissue has been suggested since binding sites for the indole have been described on brown adipocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate a genetic effect of melatonin on isolated Siberian hamster brown adipocytes using differential display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR). Brown adipose cells were isolated from brown adipose tissue and treated for 3 hr with 0.1 and 10 microM melatonin. Total RNA was extracted and DDRT-PCR experiments were performed. A differential band, which disappeared after melatonin treatment, was detected. After confirmation and cloning, the corresponding cDNA fragment B18 was sequenced. B18 had 85 and 81% similarity with a portion of rat and mouse cytochrome b mRNA, respectively, suggesting that B18 corresponds to hamster cytochrome b. This hypothesis was confirmed by the close parallel between the changes in mRNA content, detected by B18, and by cytochrome b mRNA content, detected by a rat probe. Cytochrome b mRNA is encoded by the mitochondrial genome, suggesting a similar effect of melatonin on the whole mitochondrial transcripts. Indeed, 3 hr of treatment with melatonin (10 nM and 0.1 microM) decreased by 44% mitochondrial transcript contents. This work constitutes the first evidence of a direct biological effect of melatonin on Siberian hamster brown adipocytes.	0
20738136	Chemiluminescence arising from the decomposition of peroxymonocarbonate and enhanced by CdTe quantum dots. CdTe quantum dots (QDs) capped with mercaptoacetic acid were applied to the hydrogen peroxide-sodium hydrogen carbonate chemiluminescence (CL) system. The CL emission intensity was significantly enhanced by different sizes of CdTe QDs. Peroxymonocarbonate (HCO(4)(-)) was formed in the reaction of hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydrogen carbonate, which was a reactive oxygen species. Decomposition of HCO(4)(-) generated superoxide ion radical (  O(2)(-)) and hydroxide radical (  OH). The enhanced CL was induced by the excited CdTe QDs, which could be produced from the combination of hole (oxidized QDs (h(+))) and electron (reduced QDs (e(-))) injected QDs. Radical scavengers and organic reagents such as nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT), cytochrome c, sodium azide, ascorbic acid, thiourea, tert-butanol, and dimethyl sulphoxide were used to study the emitting species. The intermediate hydroxide radical and superoxide ion were key species for producing hole and electron-injected QDs. Four emitters such as (1)O(2), (O(2))(2)*, (CO(2))(2)* and CdTe* were detected in the CL system. The mechanism was discussed based on the CL emission spectra, electron spin resonance spectra, fluorescence spectra, and UV-vis absorption spectra. The CL properties of CdTe QDs will be helpful to study semiconductor nanocrystals and will open new avenues for the application of QDs in many fields, such as chemistry, biology, microbiology, and biochemistry.	0
21113861	Biofilm formation at warming temperature: acceleration of microbial colonization and microbial interactive effects. River biofilms that grow on wet benthic surface are mainly composed of bacteria, algae, cyanobacteria and protozoa embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. The effects of increased river water temperature on biofilm formation were investigated. A laboratory experiment was designed employing two temperatures (11.1-13.2  C, night-day; 14.7-16.0  C, night-day) and two nutrient levels (0.054 mg P l(-1), 0.75 mg N l(-1); 0.54 mg P l(-1), 7.5 mg N l(-1)). Biofilm formation at the higher temperature was faster, while the biomass of the mature biofilm was mainly determined by nutrient availability. The specific response of the three microbial groups that colonized the substrata (algae, bacteria and ciliates) was modulated by interactions between them. The greater bacterial growth rate and earlier bacterial colonization at the higher temperature and higher nutrient status was not translated into the accrual of higher bacterial biomass. This may result from ciliates grazing on the bacteria, as shown by an earlier increase in peritrichia at higher temperatures, and especially at high nutrient conditions. Temperature and ciliate grazing might determine the growth of a distinctive bacterial community under warming conditions. Warmer conditions also produced a thicker biofilm, while functional responses were much less evident (increases in the heterotrophic utilization of polysaccharides and peptides, but no increase in primary production and respiration). Increasing the temperature of river water might lead to faster biofilm recolonization after disturbances, with a distinct biofilm community structure that might affect the trophic web. Warming effects would be expected to be more relevant under eutrophic conditions.	0
9821332	Identification of the active site serine of penicillin-binding protein 2a from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by electrospray mass spectrometry. Penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), a high molecular mass PBP, is the primary enzyme responsible for the beta-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Inhibition of a PBP such as PBP2a by beta-lactams is due to covalent modification of an active site serine residue. Based on the sequence alignment with well studied beta-lactamases, DD-carboxypeptidases and other high molecular mass PBPs, the serine of a tetrad S403XXK in PBP2a was tentatively identified as the penicillin-binding site. However, direct evidence for the involvement of serine403 has not been reported. In this study, a method which combines liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and nano-electrospray MS for the identification of the active site serine in PBP2a is described. The covalent binding of the beta-lactams was carried out in vitro with the recombinant PBP2a. Peptide mapping of the cyanogen bromide fragments from penicilloyl-PBP2a, using microbore LC/MS, provided a rapid identification of the modified peptide with a 334 Da mass increase. The acylated peptide was isolated and further digested with trypsin. Nano-electrospray MS/MS sequencing of the acylated peptide in the tryptic digest showed that the penicillin was indeed attached to serine403.	0
9844734	Degradation of transferrin and albumin by radical reactions in human plasma evaluated by immunoblot. Immunoblot analysis showed that transferrin and human serum albumin were degraded in a similar rate on the basis of the protein weight by radical reactions using a solution containing each protein initiated by Cu2+ and hydrogen peroxide. When plasma was treated with Cu2+ and hydrogen peroxide, the rate profile of the degradation of transferrin was similar to that of albumin based on immunoblot analysis in spite that the content of these proteins in plasma was considerably different. These results suggest that highly reactive hydroxyl radicals attack these proteins indiscriminately. Present observations demonstrate that immunoblot analysis is an effective method to analyze radical reactions of each protein in the presence of many other proteins like plasma.	0

21049754	Supporting the competence of practitioners: back to the future? Health visitors have traditionally been part of the public health workforce, but changes within the NHS have resulted in a reduced public health role.With the development of NMC public health competencies and renaming of their qualification to specialist community public health nurse (SCPHN), their public health role has again become prominent. This study aimed to examine whether practitioners were supported in fulfilling the development of these competencies and to identify strategic resources within the local health service that would either help or hinder these developments.A qualitative approach and purposive sampling were utilised, resulting in five participants in two focus groups. Findings were set within the continually evolving context of government policy and local health agendas--the potential facilitation or conflict of competence afforded by the local health strategies, priorities and requirements of the local and national health economy, the capabilities of health visiting staff and their service as a whole and the role of historical and cultural issues, and the future service and workforce development. Further research is recommended to increase understanding of the processes that inform and evaluate local health service priorities, their impact upon practitioners and how SCPHNs may develop their competence in public health practice.	0
20677138	[Sperm chromosome analysis and preimplantation genetic diagnos is in an infertile male with mosaic trisomy 18]. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the numerical aberration rate of X, Y and chromosome 18 in sperms from an oligozoospermic male with mosaic trisomy 18 and to perform preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for the couple. METHODS: G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed on metaphase chromosome. Sperm was analyzed in three-color FISH with a probe mixture containing CEP18, CEPY and Tel Xq/Yq. A healthy man with normal semen parameters was used as control. RESULTS: Significant difference in the rates of disomy for chromosome 18 (0.63% vs. 0.16%) and the gonosomes (0.945% vs. 0.35%) and diploidy (0.87% vs. 0.31%) was found in the spermatozoa between the patient and the control. After four embryos were biopsied in one PGD cycle, two embryos with XY1818 and XX1818 were selected for implanting and clinical pregnancy was ongoing. CONCLUSION: Sperm-FISH allows further understanding of aneuploidy rate and accurate genetic counseling. FISHPGD was effective for patient with mosaic trisomy 18.	0
23878938	Preparation, characterization and gas permeation investigation of resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer or carbon xerogels/tubular ceramic composites. New very stable composites prepared by deposition of resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer (RF-) or carbon (C-) xerogels into walls of commercial porous tubular ceramics (TiO2-ZrO2 and alphaAl2O3-gammaAl203) were obtained by a sol-gel process followed by a drying and a pyrolytic (only for C-xerogel/ceramic composites) step. They were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, SEM and XRD, and tested for gas (H2, CH4, CO2 and CO) separation applications. Additional morpho-structural information about the open-interconnected ultramicropore structure of composites was found by gas permeation investigation. Interesting results for H2 permeance was obtained especially for RF-polymer/ceramic composites respecting Knudsen diffusion mechanism of gas permeance: H2 > CH4 > CO > CO2. The coexistence of Knudsen and surface diffusion mechanisms were confirmed.	0

11129532	Tethered cord syndrome in adults. BACKGROUND: The tethered cord syndrome (TCS) consists of an abnormally low conus medullaris tethered by a thickened filum terminale or various forms of spinal dysraphism. The adult variant of the syndrome seems not to be as rare as once thought. METHOD: This study includes 11 patients with a TCS. Clinical, radiological findings and outcome were reviewed in these adult patients with TCS. FINDINGS: The patients ranged in age from 18 to 34 years (mean 24.09 years). There were 7 men and 4 women. The presenting symptoms in order of frequency were as follows: low back pain radiating to legs, urinary complaints, weakness in legs and impotence. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging scans. Physical exercise in 8, birth delivery in 1 and carrying heavy objects in 1 patient were determined as the precipitating factors. No precipitating factor could be defined in one of the patients. All patients were operated on, except for one. None of the patients worsened after surgery. INTERPRETATION: The patients presenting with low back pain and sciatica responded to surgery better than those with sphincter problems.	0
10575608	A comparison of profitability and economic efficiencies between management-intensive grazing and conventionally managed dairies in Michigan. A retrospective cohort study was designed to determine differences in profitability, asset efficiency, operating efficiency, and labor efficiency between Michigan dairy farms implementing management-intensive grazing (MIG) and conventionally managed dairy farms. Financial information and labor use data for the calendar year 1994 were collected with surveys and personal interviews from 35 MIG dairies and 18 conventionally managed dairies. Because the geographic distribution of MIG and conventionally managed farms in this study did not include Michigan's \"dairy belt,\" extrapolation of these results to an average Michigan or Midwest dairy should be made with care. Within the areas represented, however, multivariate linear regression indicated that MIG dairies had more economic profit than conventionally managed dairies. They captured this profit by being more efficient in asset use, operating practices, and labor use. These results suggest that MIG could provide a sustainable alternate management tool for portions of Michigan's dairy industry.	0
10343384	Effect of artificial periodicity in simulations of biomolecules under Ewald boundary conditions: a continuum electrostatics study. Ewald and related methods are nowadays routinely used in explicit-solvent simulations of biomolecules, although they impose an artificial periodicity in systems which are inherently non-periodic. The consequences of this approximation should be assessed, since they may crucially affect the reliability of computer simulations under Ewald boundary conditions. In the present study we use a method based on continuum electrostatics to investigate the nature and magnitude of possible periodicity-induced artifacts on the potentials of mean force for conformational equilibria in biomolecules. Three model systems and pathways are considered: polyalanine oligopeptides (unfolding), a DNA tetranucleotide (separation of the strands), and the protein Sac7d (conformations from a molecular dynamics simulation). Artificial periodicity may significantly affect these conformational equilibria, in each case stabilizing the most compact conformation of the biomolecule. Three factors enhance periodicity-induced artifacts: (i) a solvent of low dielectric permittivity; (ii) a solute size which is non-negligible compared to the size of the unit cell; and (iii) a non-neutral solute. Neither the neutrality of the solute nor the absence of charge pairs at distances exceeding half the edge of the unit cell do guarantee the absence of artifacts.	0
8573807	Heat generation and hemolysis at the shaft seal in centrifugal blood pumps. The heat and hemolysis around a shaft seal were investigated. Materials were original pumps (Nikkiso HMS-15:N-original, and 3M Delphin:D-original), vane-removed pumps (Nvane(-), Dvane(-)), and a small chamber with a shaft coiled by nichrome wire (mock pump). The original pumps were driven at 500 mmHg and 5 L/min, and vane-removed pumps were driven at the same rotation number. An electrical powers of 0, 0.5, 2, and 10 W was supplied to the mock pumps. In vitro hemolytic testing showed that hemolytic indices were 0.027 g/100 L in N-original, 0.013 in Nvane(-), 0.061 in D-original, and 0.012 in Dvane(-). Measurement of heat with a thermally insulated water chamber showed total heat within the pump of 8.62 and 10.85 W, and heat at the shaft seal of 0.87 and 0.62 W in the Nikkiso and Delphin pumps, respectively. Hemolysis and heat generation of mock pumps remained low. The results indicate that the heat generated around the shaft seal was minimal. Hemolysis at the shaft-seal was considerable but not major. Local heat did not affect hemolysis. It was concluded that the shaft-seal affected hemolysis, not by local heat but friction itself.	0
11977948	Ultrasound diagnosis of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: determinants of pyloric length and the effect of prematurity. AIM: To evaluate the determinants of sonographic measurements of pyloric length and muscle thickness in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) and to determine whether infants born prematurely have proportionately smaller measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of 190 infants operated on for HPS at Bristol Children's Hospital over a 5-year period. Sonographic measurements of pyloric length and muscle thickness were related to age, history of prematurity, weight, sex and family history of HPS. RESULTS: Pyloric length in infants with HPS was significantly greater in those born at term compared to those born prematurely (18.6 mm [SD 2.2] vs 17.3 mm [SD 3.1], P = 0.043); this was explainable by body weight, with length increasing by 1.13 mm (SE 0.35) per kilogram (P = 0.002). There was no significant relationship with measured muscle thickness. CONCLUSION: Sonographic measurement of pyloric length is strongly correlated with the weight of the infant, irrespective of other factors. The relationship of length and weight may be useful in confirming the presence of HPS in small and premature infants.	0
21103060	Characterization of engineered actin binding proteins that control filament assembly and structure. BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic cells strictly regulate the structure and assembly of their actin filament networks in response to various stimuli. The actin binding proteins that control filament assembly are therefore attractive targets for those who wish to reorganize actin filaments and reengineer the cytoskeleton. Unfortunately, the naturally occurring actin binding proteins include only a limited set of pointed-end cappers, or proteins that will block polymerization from the slow-growing end of actin filaments. Of the few that are known, most are part of large multimeric complexes that are challenging to manipulate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe here the use of phage display mutagenesis to generate of a new class of binding protein that can be targeted to the pointed-end of actin. These proteins, called synthetic antigen binders (sABs), are based on an antibody-like scaffold where sequence diversity is introduced into the binding loops using a novel \"reduced genetic code\" phage display library. We describe effective strategies to select and screen for sABs that ensure the generated sABs bind to the pointed-end surface of actin exclusively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: From our set of pointed-end binders, we identify three sABs with particularly useful properties to systematically probe actin dynamics: one protein that caps the pointed end, a second that crosslinks actin filaments, and a third that severs actin filaments and promotes disassembly.	0

Aurantimycins A (1), B (2) and C (3) were isolated from the mycelium of Streptomyces aurantiacus JA 4570 as new representatives of the azinothricin group of hexadepsipeptide antibiotics. Their structures were settled by X-ray diffraction analysis of crystalline aurantimycin A (1), high field homo- and heteronuclear 2D NMR experiments, high-resolution mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Aurantimycins are characterized by a new side chain containing fourteen carbon atoms. They display strong activity against Gram-positive bacteria and cytotoxic effects against L-929 mouse fibroblast cells.	0
15110261	Evaluation of chlorophyll fluorescence and membrane injury in the leaves of barley cultivars under osmotic stress. Two physiological tests for screening drought tolerance of barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.) plants are compared in this work. Water deficit is induced by treating the plants' roots with polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000). The relative water content (RWC) of the plants is used as a measure of the water status. Conductometrically determined electrolyte leakage from the leaf tissue demonstrates the membrane injury caused by dehydration. It is shown that the injury index increases with the decrease of the RWC of the leaves. The F(v)/F(m) ratio is employed to assess changes in the primary photochemical reactions of the photosynthetic apparatus after dehydration. The results suggest that PSII is weakly affected by the imposed osmotic stress. The fluorescence behaviour of the examined cultivars is related to their RWC.	0
18233573	Spin echo formation in the presence of stochastic dynamics. Spin echo formation in magnetic field gradients in the presence of fast stochastic motion is studied for hyperpolarized 3He gas at different diffusivities. The fast translational motion leads to frequency shifts already during echo formation, which can be described analytically for a linear gradient. Despite complete signal loss at the position of the spin echo itself, considerable intensity can be preserved at an earlier time (sqrt[2]tau rather than 2tau, where tau is the pulse delay). Hence, the phenomenon is designated as a pseudo spin echo.	0
8996850	Parametrization by nonlinear regression analysis of the active acid metabolite of ebastine using different weighting methods. The study of the analytical error function has been applied to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ebastine active acid metabolite after a single oral dose of 10 mg of metabolite in 6 healthy volunteers. Plasma concentrations were measured using an automated solid phase extraction method. The analytical method was fully validated and the function of the analytical error subsequently determined. The parametric approach was performed by nonlinear regression analysis comparing the results obtained after the application of different weighted least square methods including the homoscedastic method (W = 1) and heteroscedastic methods using weights of 1/C, 1/C2 and the inverse of the concentration variance calculated through the function of the analytical error. The results obtained in the study showed no influence of the different weighting methods used on the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of ebastine acid metabolite.	0
17467747	Long-term effects of oral vitamin C supplementation on the endothelial dysfunction in the iris microvessels of diabetic rats. The current study was aimed to investigate effects of long-term supplementation of vitamin C on the iris microcirculation in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in male Wistar-Furth rats by intravenous injection of STZ (55 mg/kg b.w.). The rats were divided into three groups: control rats (CON), STZ-induced diabetic rats (STZ), and STZ rats supplemented with vitamin C (STZ-vitC). For supplementation of vitamin C, ascorbic acid (1 g/l) was added into the drinking water. The experiments were performed at different periods (8, 12, 24 and 36 weeks) after injection of STZ. Blood glucose, tissue lipid peroxidation and plasma vitamin C were measured. To examine the endothelial function, leukocyte adhesion to the venular endothelium was evaluated in the iris post-capillaries by means of counting the number of leukocytes labeled with rhodamine 6G. Blood flow perfusion in the iris was monitored using a laser Doppler flow meter. In the STZ rats, hyperglycemia was induced with an increase in HbA(1c) and lipid peroxidation but with a decrease in the plasma vitamin C level which improved by vitamin C supplementation. The number of adherent leukocytes increased significantly, associated with reduction in the iris blood flow perfusion, at 8, 12, 24 and 36 weeks after injection of STZ. In the STZ-vitC rats, the iris blood flow perfusion was significantly increased in comparison with the STZ rats, while the leukocyte adhesion was decreased at 24 and 36 weeks. The statistical analysis shows that the leukocyte adhesion decreased with increase in the iris blood flow perfusion in STZ and STZ-vitC rats. In conclusion, vitamin supplementation suppressed leukocyte adhesion and thus endothelial dysfunction, associated with increase in iris blood flow perfusion in diabetes. The antioxidant vitamin C may be a therapeutic agent for preventing diabetic retinopathy.	0

21416292	Dermal fibroblasts influence the expression profile of 14-3-3 proteins in human keratinocytes. We have previously demonstrated that the release of some of the 14-3-3 isoforms from keratinocytes is able to influence the expression of key matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in dermal fibroblasts. Conversely, in this study we aimed to investigate whether dermal fibroblasts possess the ability to modulate the expression of 14-3-3 proteins in keratinocytes. In order to address this question, human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were harvested and co-cultured. Intra- and extracellular levels of 14-3-3 proteins (b,   , y, and   ) were analyzed using western blot analysis, and the gene expression was further assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene analysis revealed an up-regulation of all four 14-3-3 isoforms of interest. In addition, the findings of this study reveal a significant increase in the intracellular levels of 14-3-3 y and    in keratinocytes co-cultured with fibroblasts compared to those of the mono-cultured control keratinocytes. Mechanistic investigations also demonstrated the capacity of several mitogen-activated protein kinase-specific inhibitors to markedly reduce induction of 14-3-3    in keratinocytes stimulated with fibroblast-conditioned medium. The study concluded that dermal fibroblasts possess the ability to influence the expression of several 14-3-3 isoforms (notably y and   ) in keratinocytes, suggesting that the two cell types might be capable of bi-directionally influencing the protein expression of one another in vivo.	0

2247079	A cloned human CCAAT-box-binding factor stimulates transcription from the human hsp70 promoter. The basal promoter of the human hsp70 gene is predominantly controlled by a CCAAT element at position -70 relative to the transcriptional initiation site. We report the isolation of a novel cDNA clone encoding a 114-kDa polypeptide that binds to the CCAAT element of the hsp70 promoter. Expression of this CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) cDNA activated transcription from cotransfected hsp70 promoter-reporter gene constructs in a CCAAT-dependent manner. CCAAT-binding factor shows no homology to the previously identified human CCAAT transcription factor or rat CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein.	1
24145365	Nevirapine-raltegravir combination, an NRTI and PI/r sparing regimen, as maintenance antiretroviral therapy in virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients. BACKGROUND: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and protease inhibitor (PI)/ritonavir sparing regimens may be useful to some HIV-infected patients. Nevirapine (NVP) and raltegravir (RAL) are both potent antiretrovirals with good long-term safety profiles. METHODS: We retrospectively identified from our electronic database all patients with HIV RNA<50 copies/ml for >6 months on an NVP-containing regimen and no prior exposure to integrase strand transfer inhibitors who were switched to RAL plus NVP. Data was collected for 36 months or until discontinuation of RAL plus NVP for any reason. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients (30 male) were included in this analysis. Median duration of prior antiretroviral therapy was 14 years (IQR 10-17) and median duration with plasma HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml prior to switch was 50 months (IQR 22-96). Switched regimens included mainly a boosted PI (n=24) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (n=12). After switching, the percentages of patients with HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml were 87.2% (95% CI 76.7, 97.7) and 82.1% (95% CI 70.0, 94.1) at 6 and 12 months, respectively, in the intent-to-treat-exposed analysis, 97.1% (95% CI 91.6, 100) and 94.1% (95% CI 86.2, 100), respectively, in the per-protocol analysis. All patients with follow-up to month 24 (n=22) or month 36 (n=14) had HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml. One virological failure was observed (related to archived non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutation). During follow-up, no patient experienced Grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Median values of serum creatinine and lipids significantly improved after switch. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with prolonged HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/ml, switching to NVP-RAL combination maintained virological suppression throughout 36 months. This combination deserves further evaluation in patients unable to tolerate NRTI or PI/ritonavir agents.	0
16159766	Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli to external zinc. Transcriptional response of Escherichia coli to extracellular zinc was studied using DNA microarray and S1 mapping assays. Addition of external zinc induced the expression of zinc exporter ZntA and inhibited the expression of zinc importer ZnuC. In the continuous presence of zinc, ZnuC repression took place at lower zinc concentrations than ZntA induction. The microarray assay indicated that the addition of excess external zinc induces the expression of many genes that are organized in the regulon for cysteine biosynthesis, implying that cysteine plays a role in transient trapping of free zinc for maintenance of zinc homeostasis. Besides the RpoE regulon, other genes were also induced by zinc, suggesting that periplasmic proteins denatured by zinc induce the genes for protein repair. The microarray data of the newly identified zinc-responsive promoters were confirmed by S1 mapping.	0
7742124	Digital luminescence radiography and conventional radiography in abdominal contrast examinations. In 326 patients abdominal contrast radiographs were compared to digital luminescence radiographs (DLR) and conventional screen-film system ones. The digital exposure dose was 50% of the conventional. In DLR, 2 different types of postprocessed images were obtained from each data set. A display with low spatial frequency enhancement filtered to look like a conventional radiograph was compared to a display with high spatial frequency enhancement. Conventional and DLR images were evaluated randomly and separately by 4 radiologists by means of a questionnaire. DLR proved to be diagnostically equivalent to the conventional technique with the exception of a slightly diminished visibility of the mucosal pattern. High spatial frequency enhancement did not provide additional diagnostic information and should be dispensed with in abdominal examinations.	0

16766932	Expandable intramedullary nailing for tibial and femoral fractures: a preliminary analysis of perioperative complications. OBJECTIVE: To report the results of using the expandable nailing system in the treatment of femoral and tibial shaft fractures. DESIGN: Prospective, cohort series. SETTING: Two level-1 university trauma centers. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight patients with acute, traumatic diaphyseal fractures of the tibia or femur. INTERVENTION: Internal fixation of lower extremity long bone fractures using expandable intramedullary nailing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Perioperative complications and time to healing. RESULTS: Forty-nine long bone fractures were treated: 22 femoral fractures (OTA classification: 4 type A1, 6 A2, 7 A3, 1 B1, and 4 B2) and 27 tibial fractures (OTA classification: 4 type A1, 11 A2, 9 A3, 0 B1, and 3 B2). There were 13 open fractures and 37 closed fractures. Healing occurred in 37 (75%) fractures without additional interventions. There were 2 tibial delayed unions and 1 femoral and 1 tibial nonunion. Five tibial shaft fractures and 6 femoral fractures shortened by 1.0 cm or more postoperatively. In 3 tibias and 4 femurs, shortening occurred after fractures judged to be length-stable became unstable because of fracture propagation during nail expansion. Five tibias and 3 femurs were converted to standard locked nails because of shortening. The average time to healing, excluding nonunion, was 15 weeks in the tibia and 16 weeks in the femur. The expandable nail resulted in an unplanned reoperation in 12 cases (25%). CONCLUSION: We found a high complication rate because of shortening, which was independent of fracture classification. Consequently, we cannot recommend the use of an unlocked, expandable nail in diaphyseal fractures of the femur or tibia.	0

21089677	[Association of HLA-A0205 and HLA-A30 with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults]. To investigate the association of HLA-A0205 and HLA-A30 with latent autoimmune diabetes mellius in adults (LADA) in Chengdu Hans, 121 subjects (41 cases of LADA, 40 cases of T2DM, and 40 normal controls) were enrolled in the study. The frequencies of HLA-A0205 and HLA-A30 were determined by nested PCR-SSP and direct sequencing, respectively. The allele frequencies of patient groups and of normal controls were compared by chi-square test using SPSS 11.0 (alpha = 0.05). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested with use of software HWE (alpha = 0.05). Data from the subjects showed: HLA-A0205 was present in 1 patient with LADA and in 1 normal control (2.44% and 2.5%, respectively), HLA-A30 was present in 2 patients with LADA, in 2 patients with T2DM and in 1 normal control (4.87%, 5.0% and 2.5%, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the allele frequencies of the three groups. These results suggest that HLA-A0205, HLA-A30 may not be related to LADA in Chengdu Hans. Yet, further studies with larger sample size may be needed to warrant this conclusion.	0

The electromyogram (EMG) amplitude of the masticatory and temporal muscles is decreased and EMG amplitude of suprasublingual muscles increased during mastication or voluntary occlusion in patients with class I dentition defects in comparison with the controls. The changes were the greater, the more antagonist pairs were missing. The duration of masticatory period and the number of masticatory movements increased. The most notable changes in the muscular activity are observed in subjects with 4 antagonist pairs missing.	0
8873752	cAMP-dependent protein kinase is required for the expression of a gene specifically expressed in Dictyostelium prestalk cells. In the Dictyostelium slug there are two types of prestalk cells, pstA cells and pstO cells, that differ in their ability to utilize the distal and proximal parts of the promoter of ecmA, a gene that is specifically expressed in prestalk cells. When Rm, a dominant inhibitory form of the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), is expressed under the control of the complete promoter of the ecmA gene (in a construct termed ecmAO:Rm) development proceeds to the slug stage. Although able to form small but outwardly normal slugs, ecmAO:Rm cells are defective in prestalk cell differentiation. In ecmAO:Rm cells, the induction of pstA- and pstO-specific gene expression by the stalk cell inducer DIF is greatly inhibited. Paradoxically, a very large fraction of the cells in an ecmAO:Rm slug show evidence of once having expressed the ecmA and ecmO prestalk markers. However, we present evidence that this is due to abortive prestalk cell differentiation that terminates when sufficient Rm protein has accumulated to block PKA activity. This results in regulative transdifferentiation of prespore cells to form prestalk cells. During their transitory period as prestalk cells the ecmAO:Rm cells coexpress both the ecmA and ecmO markers, indicating a possible link between PKA activity and divergence of the two prestalk cell subtypes. Finally, we show that the level of the DNA binding activity believed to lie at the end of the DIF signal transduction pathway is reduced in ecmAO:Rm slugs.	0

22759226	Risk of second primary in situ and invasive melanoma in a Dutch population-based cohort: 1989-2008. BACKGROUND: Patients with melanoma are at increased risk of developing a subsequent melanoma. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risks of developing a second primary in situ or invasive cutaneous melanoma after a first melanoma, between 1989 and 2008. METHODS: Patients were followed until diagnosis of a second melanoma, date of death or end of study. Cumulative risks, standardized incidence ratio (SIR, observed second melanomas divided by background age-, calendar- and sex-specific incidence rates of melanoma, as recorded in the Netherlands Cancer Registry) and absolute excess risk (AER, observed minus expected per 10 000 person-years) of second melanomas were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 10 765 patients with in situ melanoma and 46 700 with invasive melanoma were included. The cumulative risks of a second invasive melanoma after a first in situ or invasive melanoma at 20 years of follow-up were 6  2% and 5  0%, respectively. The relative risk of developing any melanoma (in situ or invasive) after any first melanoma (measured as SIR) varied from 12  4-fold [invasive after invasive melanoma; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 11  6-13  2] to 26  4-fold (in situ after in situ melanoma; 95% CI = 22  6-30  7) increase compared with the general population. SIRs and AERs remained elevated up to 20 years after the first melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows significantly increased long-term risks (both relative and absolute) of developing a second invasive melanoma after a first melanoma (invasive and in situ), and might serve as a basis for follow-up guidelines.	0
15000450	Effects of conjugated linoleic acid on body fat accumulation and serum lipids in hamsters fed an atherogenic diet. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) refers to a mixture of naturally occurring positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid that exist in dairy products and meat. The aim of the present work was to study the effects of c-9,t-11 and t-10,c-12 CLA isomers on body fat accumulation and serum lipids in hamsters fed an atherogenic diet. Hamsters were divided in four groups: one group was fed a chow diet (control) and the other three groups were given semi-purified atherogenic diets with 0.5% linoleic acid (LA), c-9,t-11 or t-10,c-12 CLA. Body weight and food intake were measured daily. After 6 weeks, adipose tissues from different anatomical locations and liver were dissected and weighed. Serum glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and triacylglycerol levels, as well as total and free cholesterol, triacylglycerol and phospholipid content in liver were determined by enzymatic methods. No differences in either energy intake or final body weight were found. The addition of t-10,c-12 CLA reduced fat accumulation and led to lower serum cholesterol, as compared with LA group. Nevertheless the level remained higher than in the control animals. The reduction in serum cholesterol was limited to LDL-c. This isomer also reduced triacylglycerol content in liver but did not modify serum triacylglycerol level. In summary, the present study demonstrates that t-10,c-12 CLA is the biologically active agent when anti-obesity and hypocholesterolaemic properties of CLA are considered. In contrast, the isomer c-9,t-11 has no effect on lipid metabolism in hamsters.	0
9088905	Biomarkers of age and aging. The escalating interest in research on interventions that may affect aging processes has necessarily focussed attention on the outcome measures. The desirable characteristics of these \"biomarker variables\" have been widely discussed. This article offers some reflections on validity, reliability, and generalizability of biomarkers. It is argued that our comprehension of aging will evolve iteratively from application of a diversity of biomarker variables. Each of these will have strengths and shortcomings from methodological and measurement points of view. The siren song that a \"gold standard\" index of aging can be found should be ignored.	0

21634113	[Cloning of genes, purification and properties investigation of recombinant DNA ligases from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum]. The genes encoding of DNA ligases from the thermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi (PabDNA ligase) and Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (MthDNA ligase) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The activity of purified enzymes was studied by ligation of two oligonucleotides, one of which had preformed hairpin structure. In the used system the maximal output of reaction products for both DNA ligases was observed near 70 degrees C that is explained by substrate thermostability. At stoichiometric ratio of enzymes and substrate the output of a product reaches of plateau at 70-75% of theoretical ones. Investigated DNA ligases showed different thermostability. The half-time life of PabDNA ligase was about 60 min at 90 degrees C. MthDNA ligase was completely inactivated at this temperature during 10 min. Recombinant DNA ligases from P. abyssi and M. thermoautotrophicum possessed high stability during a storage at 4 degrees C.	0

19922142	Total laryngectomy in patients with advanced bulbar symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our objectives were to 1) increase awareness of total laryngectomy (TL) as a treatment for complications of bulbar weakness in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and outline specific surgical indications; 2) educate physicians about the surgical procedure, peri-operative course and benefits from having a TL; and 3) retrospectively review the clinical course of Mayo Clinic-Florida patients with ALS who had a TL. The method used was a retrospective review of patients recommended to undergo TL for advanced bulbar symptoms related to ALS at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Between January 1999 and September 2008, 15 patients with severe bulbar symptoms associated with ALS were recommended to undergo TL. Only five patients opted for the surgery. All patients were aphonic at time of surgery with a multitude of bulbar symptoms. Average surgical time was 114 min (range 87-162 min). No intraoperative complications were reported. All patients and caregivers were pleased with the results of the TL. In conclusion, TL is a relatively safe, quick and uncomplicated surgical procedure that should be considered earlier and more frequently in the treatment plan of patients with advanced bulbar symptoms due to ALS. We recommend considering TL in patients with aspiration problems who are unable to phonate intelligibly.	0
9108461	Antisense to cyclin D1 inhibits the growth and tumorigenicity of human colon cancer cells. Cyclin D1 plays an important role in regulating the progression of cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This gene is frequently overexpressed in human colon cancer. To address the role of cyclin D1 in growth control and tumorigenesis in this disease, we have overexpressed an antisense cyclin D1 cDNA construct in the human colon cancer cell line SW480E8, which expresses high levels of cyclin D1. The integration and expression of the antisense construct was verified by Southern and Northern blot analyses, respectively, and resulted in decreased expression of the cyclin D1 protein. This was associated with decreased levels of the Rb and p27Kip1 proteins. In addition, the hypophosphorylated form of Rb was increased in these cells. The SW480E8 antisense cyclin D1 cells displayed an increased doubling time, a decrease in saturation density, decreased plating efficiency and anchorage-independent growth, and a loss of tumorigenicity in nude mice. These findings provide direct evidence that increased expression of cyclin D1 in colon tumor cells contributes to their abnormal growth and tumorigenicity. The ability to revert the transformed phenotype of these cells with antisense cyclin D1 suggests that cyclin D1 or its associated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 may be useful targets in the therapy of colon cancer.	0
22732223	Identification and extensive analysis of inverted-duplicated HBV integration in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA is often integrated into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although the relationship between HBV integration and HCC development has been widely studied, the role of HBV integration in HCC development is still not completely understood. In the present study, we constructed a pooled BAC library of 9 established cell lines derived from HCC patients with HBV infections. By amplifying viral genes and superpooling of BAC clones, we identified 2 clones harboring integrated HBV DNA. Screening of host-virus junctions by repeated sequencing revealed an HBV DNA integration site on chromosome 11q13 in the SNU-886 cell line. The structure and rearrangement of integrated HBV DNA were extensively analyzed. An inverted duplicated structure, with fusion of at least 2 HBV DNA molecules in opposite orientations, was identified in the region. The gene expression of cancer-related genes increased near the viral integration site in HCC cell line SNU-886.	0
19877138	Organic-inorganic hybrid silica as supporting matrices for selective recognition of bovine hemoglobin via covalent immobilization. The synthesis of poly-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) imprinted hybrid silica-based polymers for selective recognition of bovine hemoglobin (BHb) was described, where the mesoporous hybrid silica supporting matrices were prepared by a mild sol-gel process with tetraethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane as two precursors. Covalent immobilization of BHb was adopted in order to create homogeneous recognition sites. After removal of the template, the resulting imprinted polymers showed high binding affinity toward BHb and the imprinting factor (alpha) reached 2.12. The specificity of the BHb recognition was evaluated with competitive experiments, indicating the imprinted polymers have a higher selectivity for the template BHb. The easy preparation protocol and good protein recognition properties made the approach an attractive solution to depletion of high-abundance protein from bovine blood.	0
12208371	Attenuating effects of heat shock against TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis in cultured rat hepatocytes. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) induction confers protection against diverse forms of cellular injury. However, the mechanism by which HSPs exert cytoprotective effects remains unclear. Treatment of rat hepatocyte with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) induces growth arrest followed by extensive cell death by apoptosis. In this study, the effects of preexposure to heat on TGF-beta1-induced apoptosis of cultured hepatocytes were examined. Treatment of hepatocytes for 24 h with TGF-beta1 resulted in significant apoptotic cell death, as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, and hypodiploid DNA peak. Moreover, TGF-beta1-induced cell death was accompanied by an enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species and a loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential. These effects were attenuated when the hepatocytes were subjected to 43 degrees C for 20 min prior to the cytokine stimulation. The enhancement in HSP70 expression at mRNA and protein levels induced by heat preexposure was accompanied by an increase in mRNA levels of intracellular antioxidant enzymes. Heat treatment also prevented TGF-beta1-induced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) by preventing the degradation of the inhibitory protein kappa Balpha (IkappaBalpha). In conclusion, these data indicate that in the mechanism by which a mild heat pretreatment increases the resistance of hepatocytes to TGF-beta1-induced apoptotic cell death, the upregulation of catalase expression and a decrease in ROS generation are involved.	0

12064356	The effects of lithium chloride and other substances on levels of brain N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid in Canavan disease-like rats. Canavan disease (CD) is a human early-onset leukodystrophy, genetic in nature and resulting from an autosomally inherited recessive trait. CD is characterized by loss of the axon's myelin sheath, while leaving the axons intact, and spongiform degeneration, especially in white matter. It is an osmotic disease that affects both gray and white matter and is caused by the inability of oligodendrocytes to hydrolyze N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) because of a lack of aspartoacylase activity. As a result, there is a build-up of NAA in brain with both cellular and extracellular edema, as well as NAA acidemia and NAA aciduria. Recent studies have indicated that several compounds have the ability to reduce brain levels of NAA in normal mice and rats. In this investigation, these compounds have been tested, using a CD-like rat model of the human disease to evaluate their potential for use in the treatment of the disease. Of seven substances tested in an acute 5-day study, only lithium chloride treatment resulted in a significant reduction of about 13% in whole-brain NAA levels in the CD-like rat model. This is the first pharmacological investigation of the effect of drugs on the level of brain NAA in an animal model of CD, and the first report of a substance that can reduce the brain NAA level in this model.	0

16468180	Reliability and validity of observer ratings of neighborhoods. OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to examine the validity and reliability of a five-item neighborhood measurement scale. METHODS: Respondents were enrolled from two catchment areas: a poor inner city and a heterogeneous suburban area. Items combine for a total score of 5 (best) to 20 (worst). The authors compared scales across catchment areas and respondent ratings and assessed interviewer effects and retest reliability. RESULTS: Suburban neighborhood scale scores were 3 points lower (higher socioeconomic status, SES) than the inner-city scores. There was a strong relationship between scores and participants' neighborhood ratings. The retest correlation was substantial (.81), but only two of five items achieved kappas above .75. In regression models, interviewer experience and residence and individual interviewers contributed to different ratings, although there was still a marked difference between catchment areas. DISCUSSION: Observer ratings of neighborhoods show promise as a measure of neighborhood SES, despite problems with interviewer effects. Future work should improve objective criteria for ratings.	0
10217372	Plasma lipoprotein distribution and lipid transfer activities in patients with type IIb hyperlipidemia treated with simvastatin. The aim of the present study was to search in type IIb hyperlipidemic patients for putative concomitant effects of simvastatin on the physicochemical characteristics of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL), as well as on the activities of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and the phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) that were determined in both endogenous lipoprotein-dependent and endogenous lipoprotein-independent assays. In a double-blind, randomized trial, patients received either placebo (one tablet/day; n = 12) or simvastatin (20 mg/day; n = 12) for a period of 8 weeks after a 5-week run-in period. Simvastatin, unlike placebo, reduced the lipid and apolipoprotein B contents of the most abundant LDL-1, LDL-2, and LDL-3 subfractions without inducing significant changes in the overall size distribution of LDL and HDL. Whereas simvastatin significantly increased PLTP activity in an endogenous lipoprotein-dependent assay (P < 0.01), no variation was observed in a lipoprotein-independent assay. Simvastatin significantly decreased plasma CETP activity in an endogenous lipoprotein-dependent assay (P < 0.01), and the reduction in plasma cholesteryl ester transfer rates was explained by a 16% drop in CETP mass concentration (P < 0.01). In contrast, the specific activity of CETP was unaffected by the simvastatin treatment reflecting at least in part the lack of significant alteration in plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein acceptors. The simvastatin-induced changes in plasma CETP mass levels correlated positively with changes in plasma CETP activity (r = 0.483, P = 0.0561), in total cholesterol levels (r = 0.769; P < 0.01), and in LDL-cholesterol levels (r = 0.736; P < 0.01). Whereas the observations suggest that simvastatin might exert concomitant beneficial effects on plasma CETP and LDL levels, neither plasma cholesteryl ester transfer activity nor plasma phospholipid transfer activity appeared as the main determinants of the LDL and HDL distribution profiles in type IIb hyperlipidemic patients.	0
16960846	Multiplex primer extension analysis for rapid detection of major European mitochondrial haplogroups. The evolution of the human mitochondrial genome is reflected in the existence of ethnically distinct lineages or haplogroups. Alterations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been instrumental in studies of human phylogeny, in population genetics, and in molecular medicine to link pathological mutations to a variety of human diseases of complex etiology. For each of these applications, rapid and cost effective assays for mtDNA haplogrouping are invaluable. Here we describe a hierarchical system for mtDNA haplogrouping that combines multiplex PCR amplifications, multiplex single-base primer extensions, and CE for analyzing ten haplogroup-diagnostic mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using this rapid and cost-effective mtDNA genotyping method, we were able to show that within a large, randomly selected cohort of healthy Austrians (n = 1172), mtDNAs could be assigned to all nine major European haplogroups. Forty-four percent belonged to haplogroup H, the most frequent haplogroup in European Caucasian populations. The other major haplogroups identified were U (15.4%), J (11.8%), T (8.2%) and K (5.1%). The frequencies of haplogroups in Austria is within the range observed for other European countries. Our method may be suitable for mitochondrial genotyping of samples from large-scale epidemiology studies and for identifying markers of genetic susceptibility.	0

11268217	Regulation of CD40 and CD40 ligand by the AT-hook transcription factor AKNA. Proteins containing AT hooks bind A/T-rich DNA through a nine-amino-acid motif and are thought to co-regulate transcription by modifying the architecture of DNA, thereby enhancing the accessibility of promoters to transcription factors. Here we describe AKNA, a human AT-hook protein that directly binds the A/T-rich regulatory elements of the promoters of CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) and coordinately regulates their expression. Consistent with its function, AKNA is a nuclear protein that contains multiple PEST protein-cleavage motifs, which are common in regulatory proteins with high turnover rates. AKNA is mainly expressed by B and T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. During B-lymphocyte differentiation, AKNA is mainly expressed by germinal centre B lymphocytes, a stage in which receptor and ligand interactions are crucial for B-lymphocyte maturation. Our findings show that an AT-hook molecule can coordinately regulate the expression of a key receptor and its ligand, and point towards a molecular mechanism that explains homotypic cell interactions.	1
11734923	180 degree pinhole SPET with a tilted detector and OS-EM reconstruction: phantom studies and potential clinical applications. This study investigated the feasibility of ordered subsets expectation maximisation (OS-EM) reconstruction of pinhole single-photon emission tomography (SPET) acquired with a tilted detector head and a 180 degrees orbit. Phantom and patient data were recorded using a standard single-head camera. Reconstructions were performed using a dedicated OS-EM algorithm. Reconstructed images of line, uniformity and Picker's thyroid phantoms showed that the geometry, physical size and uniformity of the radioactive objects were preserved. For the range of radius corresponding to the patient studies, the measured full-widths at half-maximum lay between 4.90+/-0.25 mm and 6.05+/-0.25 mm. Finally, the gain in resolution associated with the use of the pinhole collimator instead of a parallel-hole collimator was highlighted in a parathyroid exploration and in a shoulder bone study.	0
20510801	Real-time 3-dimensional virtual reality navigation system with open MRI for breast-conserving surgery. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report on the early experiences using a real-time 3-dimensional (3D) virtual reality navigation system with open MRI for breast-conserving surgery. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a real-time 3D virtual reality navigation system with open MRI, and evaluated the mismatch between the navigation system and real distance using a 3D phantom. Two patients with nonpalpable MRI-detected breast tumors underwent breast-conserving surgery under the guidance of the navigation system. An initial MRI for the breast tumor using skin-affixed markers was performed immediately before excision. A percutaneous intramammary dye marker was applied to delineate an excision line, and the computer software \"3D Slicer\" generated a real-time 3D virtual reality model of the tumor and the puncture needle in the breast. Excision of the tumor was performed in the usual manner along the excision line indicated with the dye. The resected specimens were carefully examined histopathologically. RESULTS: The mean mismatch between the navigation system and real distance was 2.01 +/- 0.32 mm when evaluated with the 3D phantom. Under guidance by the navigation system, a percutaneous intramammary dye marker was applied without any difficulty. Fiducial registration errors were 3.00 mm for patient no. 1, and 4.07 mm for patient no. 2. Histopathological examinations of the resected specimens of the 2 patients showed noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ. The surgical margins were free of carcinoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time 3D virtual reality navigation system with open MRI is feasible for safe and accurate excision of nonpalpable MRI-detected breast tumors. Long-term outcomes of this technique should be evaluated further.	0
19783528	A subset of dysregulated metabolic and survival genes is associated with severity of hepatic steatosis in obese Zucker rats. We aimed to characterize the primary abnormalities associated with fat accumulation and vulnerability to hepatocellular injury of obesity-related fatty liver. We performed functional analyses and comparative transcriptomics of isolated primary hepatocytes from livers of obese insulin-resistant Zucker rats (comprising mild to severe hepatic steatosis) and age-matched lean littermates, searching for novel genes linked to chronic hepatic steatosis. Of the tested genome, 1.6% was identified as steatosis linked. Overexpressed genes were mainly dedicated to primary metabolism (100%), signaling, and defense/acute phase (approximately 70%); detoxification, steroid, and sulfur metabolism (approximately 65%) as well as cell growth/proliferation and protein synthesis/transformation (approximately 70%) genes were downregulated. The overexpression of key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid and glycerolipid import and synthesis, as well as acetyl-CoA and cofactor provision was paralleled by enhanced hepatic lipogenesis and production of large triacylglycerol-rich VLDL. Greatest changes in gene expression were seen in those encoding the lipogenic malic enzyme (up to 7-fold increased) and cell-to-cell interacting cadherin 17 (up to 8-fold decreased). Among validated genes, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, fatty acid translocase/Cd36, malic enzyme, cholesterol-7 alpha hydroxylase, cadherin 17, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha significantly correlated with severity of hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, dysregulated expression of metabolic and survival genes accompany hepatic steatosis in obese insulin-resistant rats and may render steatotic hepatocytes more vulnerable to cell injury in progressive nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	0
17418092	Hypertrophy and atrophy inversely regulate Caveolin-3 expression in myoblasts. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3) is a muscle-specific membrane protein crucial for myoblast differentiation, as loss of the protein due to mutations within the gene causes an autosomal dominant form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy 1-c. Here we show that along with p38 activity the PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway is required for proper Cav-3 up-regulation during muscle differentiation and hypertrophy, as confirmed by the marked increase of Cav-3 expression in hypertrophied C2C12 cells transfected with an activated form of AKT. Accordingly, Cav-3 expression was further increased during hypertrophy of L6C5 myoblasts treated with Arg(8)-vasopressin and in hypertrophic muscles of MLC/mIGF-1 transgenic mice. In contrast, Cav-3 expression was down-regulated in C2C12 myotubes exposed to atrophic stimuli such as starvation or treatment with dexamethasone. This study clearly suggests that Cav-3 expression is causally linked to the maturation of muscle phenotype and it is tightly regulated by hypertrophic and atrophic stimuli.	0
19239874	Intramedullary screw fixation for balancing of the dysvascular foot following transmetatarsal amputation. Transmetatarsal amputation is a viable alternative to more proximal pedal amputations or leaving a deformed partial forefoot amputation. Balancing the transmetatarsal amputation in order to correct soft-tissue deformities is an accepted approach and consists of various tendon transfers, However, in the recently re-vascularized limb or in those patients who can not undergo re-vascularization, additional incisions to balance the transmetatarsal amputation are not performed. The authors present a simple and effective technique utilizing a large diameter, cannulated screw extending from the residual first metatarsal across the midfoot and into the talus after the foot has been manually corrected, which is useful for patients undergoing transmetatarsal amputation who can not undergo soft-tissue balancing.	0

20943111	Vacuum-assisted closure therapy as a pretreatment for split thickness skin grafts. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy on wound management by measuring the graft take, wound healing time, need for any re-grafting and duration of hospitalization. STUDY DESIGN: Single blinded randomized controlled trial. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: This study was carried out in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad, from October 2007 to December 2009. METHODOLOGY: A total of 100 adult patients of either gender with acute traumatic wounds were included. Patients who needed flap coverage as the primary intervention, and those with Diabetes, malignancy, bleeding diathesis were excluded. Half of the patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the rest to the control group with lottery method. All wounds were initially subjected to thorough excision. Wound bed preparation for STSG (split thickness skin graft) was achieved using 10 days pre-treatment with VAC dressings in the intervention group while employing normal saline gauzes in the control group. All patients were subsequently treated with STSG. The primary outcome measure was graft take while the secondary outcome measures included wound healing time, need for any re-grafting and duration of hospital stay. Results were compared in both groups using chi-square test. RESULTS: Marked differences were found in favour of the VAC therapy group with respect to the various wound management outcome measures studied. i.e. graft take (greater than 95% graft take in 90% of VAC therapy group vs. 18% of controls), wound healing time (2 weeks postgrafting in 90% of VAC therapy group vs. 18% of controls), need for regrafting (none among VAC therapy group vs. 8% of controls) and duration of hospital stay (less than 3 weeks in 90% of VAC therapy group vs. 18% of controls). CONCLUSION: VAC therapy should be employed in the pre-treatment of wounds planned to be reconstructed with STSG, since it has marked advantages in the wound bed preparation compared with the traditional normal saline gauze dressings.	0
12496400	Toll-like receptor 2 ligands as adjuvants for human Th1 responses. Bacterial lipopeptides (bLPs) are increasingly used as adjuvants to activate cell-mediated immune responses to foreign Ags. To explore mechanisms whereby bLPs adjuvant T cell responses, we stimulated human PBMCs with bLPs. We found that bLPs stimulate T cells to proliferate and produce IFN-gamma in an accessory cell-dependent manner and in the absence of exogenous protein Ags. The ability of bLPs to stimulate T cell proliferation was Toll-like receptor 2 dependent and required IL-12, interaction with costimulatory molecules, and MHC proteins. Our data suggest that bLPs adjuvant adaptive Th1 responses by enhancing Ag presentation of endogenous peptides.	0
9664716	Polypeptide composition of envelopes of spinach chloroplasts: two major proteins occupy 90% of outer envelope membranes. Outer and inner envelope membranes of spinach chloroplasts were isolated using floatation centrifugation followed by sedimentation sucrose density gradient centrifugation after disruption of intact chloroplasts by freezing and thawing. Two major fractions with buoyant densities of 1.11 and 1.08 g cm-3 and a minor fraction with a density of 1.15 g cm-3 were obtained. They were identified as inner and outer envelope and thylakoid fractions, respectively by analyzing their polypeptide composition by high-resolution SDS-PAGE and the N-terminal sequences of their protein components. Due to the refinement of the isolation procedure, most of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), which had always been observed as a contaminant, was eliminated from the outer envelope fraction. Application of high-resolution SDS-PAGE revealed that this fraction was rich in the low-molecular-mass outer envelope protein, E6.7 [Salomon et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 5778] and a protein with a molecular mass of 15 kDa which is homologous to the 16 kDa outer envelope protein of pea [Pohlmeyer et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94: 9504]. The two proteins account for 90% of the total proteins present in outer envelope membranes. Proteins which are suggested to function in translocation of nuclear-encoded polypeptides were not identified in the envelopes from spinach in the present study. Differences in the protein composition of outer envelope membranes are discussed based on the developemental stages of chloroplasts.	0
22865926	Honorary authorship epidemic in scholarly publications? How the current use of citation-based evaluative metrics make (pseudo)honorary authors from honest contributors of every multi-author article. The current use of citation-based metrics to evaluate the research output of individual researchers is highly discriminatory because they are uniformly applied to authors of single-author articles as well as contributors of multi-author papers. In the latter case, these quantitative measures are counted, as if each contributor were the single author of the full article. In this way, each and every contributor is assigned the full impact-factor score and all the citations that the article has received. This has a multiplication effect on each contributor's citation-based evaluative metrics of multi-author articles, because the more contributors an article has, the more undeserved credit is assigned to each of them. In this paper, I argue that this unfair system could be made fairer by requesting the contributors of multi-author articles to describe the nature of their contribution, and to assign a numerical value to their degree of relative contribution. In this way, we could create a contribution-specific index of each contributor for each citation metric. This would be a strong disincentive against honorary authorship and publication cartels, because it would transform the current win-win strategy of accepting honorary authors in the byline into a zero-sum game for each contributor.	0
21636816	Validation of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging blood-brain barrier permeability measurements by comparison with gold standard histology. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to validate the blood-brain barrier permeability measurements extracted from perfusion-weighted MRI through a relatively simple and frequently applied model, the Patlak model, by comparison with gold standard histology in a rat model of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Eleven spontaneously hypertensive rats and 11 Wistar rats with unilateral 2-hour filament occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery underwent imaging during occlusion at 4 hours and 24 hours after reperfusion. Blood-brain barrier permeability was imaged by gradient echo imaging after the first pass of the contrast agent bolus and quantified by a Patlak analysis. Blood-brain barrier permeability was shown on histology by the extravasation of Evans blue on fluorescence microscopy sections matching location and orientation of MR images. Cresyl-violet staining was used to detect and characterize hemorrhage. Landmark-based elastic image registration allowed a region-by-region comparison of permeability imaging at 24 hours with Evans blue extravasation and hemorrhage as detected on histological slides obtained immediately after the 24-hour image set. RESULTS: Permeability values in the nonischemic tissue (marginal mean    SE: 0.15    0.019 mL/min 100 g) were significantly lower compared to all permeability values in regions of Evans blue extravasation or hemorrhage. Permeability values in regions of weak Evans blue extravasation (0.23    0.016 mL/min 100 g) were significantly lower compared to permeability values of in regions of strong Evans blue extravasation (0.29    0.020 mL/min 100 g) and macroscopic hemorrhage (0.35    0.049 mL/min 100 g). Permeability values in regions of microscopic hemorrhage (0.26    0.024 mL/min 100 g) only differed significantly from values in regions of nonischemic tissue (0.15    0.019 mL/min 100 g). CONCLUSIONS: Areas of increased permeability measured in vivo by imaging coincide with blood-brain barrier disruption and hemorrhage observed on gold standard histology.	0
12181368	Applications for multifrequency ultrasound biomicroscopy in mice from implantation to adulthood. A new multifrequency (19-55 MHz) ultrasound biomicroscope with two-dimensional imaging and integrated Doppler ultrasound was evaluated using phantoms and isoflurane-anesthetized mice. Phantoms revealed the biomicroscope's lateral resolution was between 50 and 100 microm, whereas that of a conventional 13 MHz ultrasound system was 200-500 microm. This difference was apparent in the markedly higher resolution images achieved using the biomicroscope in vivo. Transcutaneous images of embryos in pregnant mice from approximately 2 days after implantation (7 days gestation) to near term (17.5 days) were obtained using frequencies from 25 to 40 MHz. The ectoplacental cone and early embryonic cavities were visible as were the placenta and embryonic organs throughout development to term. We also evaluated the ability of the biomicroscope to detect important features of heart development by examining embryos from 8.5 to 17.5 day gestation in exteriorized uteri using 55 MHz ultrasound. Cardiac looping, division of the outflow tract, and ventricular septation were visible. In postnatal imaging, we observed the heart and kidney of neonatal mice at 55 MHz, the carotid artery in juveniles (approximately 8 g body wt) and adults (approximately 25 g body wt) at 40 MHz, and the adult heart, aorta, and kidney at 19 MHz. The coefficient of variation of carotid and aortic diameter measurements was 1-3%. In addition, blisters in GRIP1 -/- embryos and aortic valvular stenosis in two adults were readily visualized. Using image-guided Doppler function, low blood velocities in vessels as small as 100 microm in diameter including the primitive heart tube at day 8.5 were measurable, but high blood velocities (>37.5 cm/s) such as in the heart and large arteries in late gestation and postnatal life were off-scale. Accurate cardiac dimension measurements were impeded by poor temporal resolution (4 frames/s). In summary, the multifrequency ultrasound biomicroscope is a versatile tool well suited to detailed study of the morphology of various organ systems throughout development in mice and for hemodynamic measurements in the low velocity range.	0

9856472	Submillisecond kinetics of glutamate release from a sensory synapse. Exocytosis-mediated glutamate release from ribbon-type synaptic terminals of retinal bipolar cells was studied using AMPA receptors and simultaneous membrane capacitance measurements. Release onset (delay <0.8 ms) and offset were closely tied to Ca2+ channel opening and closing. Asynchronous release was not copious and we estimate that there are approximately 5 Ca2+ channels per docked synaptic vesicle. Depending on Ca2+ current amplitude, release occurred in a single fast bout or in two successive bouts with fast and slow onset kinetics. The second, slower bout may reflect a mobilization rate of reserve vesicles toward fusion sites that is accelerated by increasing Ca2+ influx. Bipolar cell synaptic ribbons thus are remarkably versatile signal transducers, capable of transmitting rapidly changing sensory input, as well as sustained stimuli, due to their large pool of releasable vesicles.	0
16220972	Introduction of a cis-prolyl mimic in position 7 of the peptide hormone oxytocin does not result in antagonistic activity. New insights into the structure-activity relationship of the peptide hormone oxytocin are presented. Incorporation of the novel cis-prolyl mimic 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (pseudoproline, PsiPro) at position 7 of the hormone yielded the analogue [Cys(Psi(Me,Me)pro)]7oxytocin (1) that showed a 92-95% induction of the cis peptide bond conformation between Cys6 and PsiPro7, as determined by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra in water and in DMSO-d6. The impact of the dimethyl moiety regarding conformation and bioactivity was investigated by the synthesis of the corresponding dihydro compound, [Cys(Psi(H,H)pro)]7oxytocin (2). Biological tests of the uterotonic activity, the pressor activity, and the binding affinity to the rat and human oxytocin receptors were carried out. As a most significant result, no antagonistic activities were found for both the cis-constrained analogue 1 and analogue 2, suggesting that a cis conformation between residues 6 and 7 of the molecule does not result in antagonistic activity. However, the about 10-fold reduction in agonistic activity of 1 as compared to oxytocin is consistent with the reduction of the trans conformation from 90% for oxytocin to 5-8% for compound 1. Compound 1 retained a high binding affinity for the oxytocin receptor, with K(i) values of 8.0 and 1.9 nM for the rat and the human receptor, respectively. The correlation between the biological activities and the cis contents obtained from NMR analysis for compounds 1, 2, and oxytocin leads to the hypothesis that a cis/trans conformational change plays an important role in oxytocin receptor binding and activation.	0
15615774	Profilin regulates the activity of p42POP, a novel Myb-related transcription factor. Profilins, regulators of cytoplasmic actin dynamics, also bind to several nuclear proteins but the significance of these interactions is mostly unclear. Here, we describe a novel Myb-related transcription factor, p42POP, as a new ligand for profilin and show that profilin regulates its activity. p42POP comprises a unique combination of domains and is widely expressed in mouse tissues. In contrast to many other Myb proteins, it contains only one functional tryptophan-cluster motif. This is followed by an acidic domain, a leucine zipper that mediates dimerization and functional nuclear import and export signals that can direct p42POP to either the nuclear or the cytoplasmic compartment. Binding to profilins is mediated by a proline-rich cluster. p42POP-profilin complexes can be precipitated from cell lysates. In transfected cells displaying p42POP in the nucleus, nuclear profilin is markedly increased. When p42POP is anchored at mitochondrial membranes, profilin is targeted to this location. Hence, in a cellular environment, p42POP and profilin are found in the same protein complex. In luciferase assays, p42POP acts as repressor and this activity is substantially reduced by profilins, indicating that profilin can regulate p42POP activity and is therefore involved in gene regulation.	0
22789829	Optimization the soda-AQ process for cellulose pulp production and energy content of black liquor from L. leucocephala K360. A commercial variety of Leucaena leucocephala K360 was used for pulp production and papermaking employing the soda-anthraquinone process. Also, the chemical and energy contents of the resultant black liquors were determined to simultaneously optimize: pulp and paper production and energy generation. A process temperature of (185  C), an operating time of (120 min) and an active alkali concentration of (21%) provided sheets of paper with good strength (tensile index of 12.12 Nm/g, burst index of 0.38 kPa m(2)/g, tear index of 1.29 mN m(2)/g and a Kappa number of 20.5) and black liquor with a greater calorific value (14.1 MJ/kg) than that obtained with higher active alkali concentrations. However, reducing the active alkali concentration to a level in the low operation range led to less marked degradation of cellulose and allowed paper sheets with good properties to be obtained and energy to be optimally produced from the black liquor.	0

16352385	Culturally compelling strategies for behaviour change: a social ecology model and case study in malaria prevention. Behaviour change is notoriously difficult to initiate and sustain, and the reasons why efforts to promote healthy behaviours fail are coming under increasing scrutiny. To be successful, health interventions should build on existing practices, skills and priorities, recognise the constraints on human behaviour, and either feature community mobilisation or target those most receptive to change. Furthermore, interventions should strive to be culturally compelling, not merely culturally appropriate: they must engage local communities and nestle within social and ecological landscapes. In this paper, we propose a social ecology perspective to make explicit the links between intention to change, actual behaviour change, and subsequent health impact, as relating to both theory-based models and practical strategies for triggering behaviour change. A social ecology model focuses attention on the contexts of behaviour when designing, implementing or critically evaluating interventions. As a case study, we reflect on a community-directed intervention in rural Gambia designed to reduce malaria by promoting a relatively simple and low-cost behaviour: repairing holes in mosquito bednets. In phase 1, contextual information on bednet usage, transactions and repairs (the 'social lives' of nets) was documented. In phase 2 (intervention), songs were composed and posters displayed by community members to encourage repairs, creating a sense of ownership and a compelling medium for the transmission of health messages. In phase 3 (evaluation), qualitative and quantitative data showed that household responses were particularly rapid and extensive, with significant increase in bednet repairs (p<0.001), despite considerable constraints on human agency. We highlight a promising approach-using songs-as a vehicle for change, and present a framework to embed the design, implementation and critical evaluation of interventions within the larger context-or social ecology-of behaviour practices that are the bedrock of health interventions.	0
20869972	Speedball induced changes in electrically stimulated dopamine overflow in rat nucleus accumbens. Cocaine/heroin combinations (speedball) induce a synergistic elevation in extracellular dopamine concentrations ([DA](e)) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that can explain the increased abuse liability of speedball. To further delineate the mechanism of this neurochemical synergism, in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) was used to compare NAc DA release and reuptake kinetic parameters following acute administration of cocaine, heroin and speedball in drug-na  ve rats. These parameters were extracted from accumbal DA overflow induced by electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area. Evoked DA efflux was increased following both cocaine and speedball delivery, whereas heroin did not significantly change evoked DA release from baseline. DA efflux was significantly greater following cocaine compared to speedball. However, DA transporter (DAT) apparent affinity (K(m)) values were similarly elevated following cocaine and speedball administration, but unaffected by heroin. Neither drug induced substantial changes in the maximal reuptake rate (V(max)). These data, combined with published microdialysis and electrophysiological results, indicate that the combination of cocaine-induced competitive inhibition of DAT and the increase in the DA release elicited by heroin is responsible for the synergistic increase in ([DA](e)) induced by speedball.	0

9317282	STUDIES OF TROPICAL TUNA SWIMMING PERFORMANCE IN A LARGE WATER TUNNEL - THERMOREGULATION The body temperatures (Tb) of nine yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) were monitored while fish swam in a large water tunnel at controlled velocities (U) and ambient temperatures (Ta). Monitoring Tb during step changes in Ta at constant U permitted estimation of the thermal rate coefficient (k), an index of heat transfer. In the yellowfin, k is dependent on both Ta and the direction of the thermal gradient (i.e. whether Ta is greater or less than Tb). Modulation of k in response to Ta was further demonstrated during tests in which U was varied; the elevation of Tb in response to equal increases in U was 3_4 times less at 30 C than at 25 and 20 C. These experiments demonstrate that the yellowfin tuna can modulate heat transfer. This ability could prevent overheating during intense activity, retard heat loss during a descent into cool water and permit increased heat gain upon returning to warm surface waters (i.e. when Tb<Ta).	0

11832226	A calcium-responsive transcription factor, CaRF, that regulates neuronal activity-dependent expression of BDNF. Transcription of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene is regulated in a calcium- and neuron-selective manner; however, the mechanisms that underlie this selectivity are not known. We have characterized a new calcium-response element, CaRE1, that is required for activity-dependent transcription of BDNF exon III and have cloned a transcription factor, CaRF, that activates transcription from BDNF promoter III in a CaRE1-dependent manner. The transcriptional activity of CaRF is regulated in a calcium- and neuron-selective manner, suggesting that CaRF may confer selectivity upon the activity-dependent induction of BDNF exon III expression.	1

12660216	Endogenous versus exogenous glucocorticoid responses to experimental bacterial sepsis. Although lack of adrenals dramatically reduces resistance against sepsis generally, the value of glucocorticoid levels above those normally produced by stress remains controversial. An early and long-held concept is that glucocorticoid protection against lipopolysaccharides in animal models is important. Supporting this concept, C3H/HeJ mice, lacking Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), and consequently, endotoxin hyporesponsive, have recently been shown to be resistant to glucocorticoid protection against live Escherichia coli. Effective antibiotic intervention, as an additional parameter and with concomitant administration of glucocorticoid, not only allows for expected antibiotic protection but also for glucocorticoid protection against E. coli or Staphylococcus aureus of mice sensitized to tumor necrosis factor alpha, regardless of the status of the TLR-4 receptor. TLRs, including but not limited to TLR-2, may be involved in glucocorticoid protective efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative sepsis. Overlapping and possibly endotoxin-independent signaling may become important considerations.	0
15181091	Parental origin of Gsalpha mutations in the McCune-Albright syndrome and in isolated endocrine tumors. Activating mutations of the Gsalpha gene are detected in different endocrine tumors, such as GH-secreting adenomas and toxic thyroid adenomas, and in hyperfunctioning glands from patients with McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS). There is increasing evidence that the Gsalpha gene is subjected to imprinting control and that Gsalpha imprinting plays a key role in the pathogenesis of different human diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of a parent specificity of Gsalpha mutations in 10 patients affected with MAS and 12 isolated tumors (10 GH-secreting adenomas, one toxic thyroid adenoma, and one hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma). The parental origin of Gsalpha mutations was assessed by evaluating NESP55 and exon 1A transcripts, which are monoallelically expressed from the maternal and paternal alleles, respectively. By this approach, we demonstrated that in isolated GH-secreting adenomas, as well as in MAS patients with acromegaly, Gsalpha mutations were on the maternal allele. By contrast, the involvement of other endocrine organs in MAS patients was not associated with a particular parent specificity, as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism were present in patients with mutations on either the maternal or the paternal allele. Moreover, isolated hyperfunctioning thyroid and adrenal adenomas displayed the mutation on the maternal and paternal alleles, respectively. These data confirm the importance of Gsalpha imprinting in the pituitary gland and point out the high degree of tissue specificity of this phenomenon.	0
23754725	The transition from freshwater to marine iron-oxidizing bacterial lineages along a salinity gradient on the Sheepscot River, Maine, USA. Oxygen-dependent, neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) are important drivers of iron transformations in marine and freshwater environments. Despite remarkable similarities in physiology and morphotype, known freshwater and marine FeOB are clustered in different classes of Proteobacteria; freshwater FeOB in the Betaproteobacteria and marine FeOB in the Zetaproteobacteria. To determine effects of salinity on these microbes, we examined the mineral biosignatures and molecular ecology of bacteria in FeOB mats collected along an estuarine salinity gradient. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses showed the presence of iron oxide stalk and sheath structures in both freshwater and saline iron mats. Results of tagged pyrosequencing, quantitative PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization, all based on the small subunit rRNA gene, confirmed Zetaproteobacteria were not present in freshwater mats, but were in saline mats at salinities down to 5   . Among the Betaproteobacteria, Leptothrix spp. were only found in the freshwater mat. Gallionella spp. were limited to freshwater and low salinity mats (< 5   ). Sideroxydans sp. were salt tolerant; however, their relative abundance decreased with increasing salinity. These results suggest salinity is important in shaping the population biology of iron mat communities, and some coexistence between marine and freshwater populations occurs in brackish waters.	0
8132763	Persistence of the fetal pattern of tropoelastin gene expression in severe neonatal bovine pulmonary hypertension. Neonatal hypoxic pulmonary hypertension causes increases and spatial changes in tropoelastin expression in pulmonary arteries. However, it is not clear if this is due to recruitment of quiescent smooth muscle cells (SMC) into an elastin-producing phenotype or persistence of the fetal pattern of tropoelastin gene expression. We evaluated the distribution and relative concentration of tropoelastin mRNA in intralobar pulmonary arteries from late gestation fetuses and in animals exposed to hypobaric hypoxia (430 mmHg) from birth for 1, 3, 7, or 14 d, as well as in age-matched and adult room air-breathing controls. In situ hybridization demonstrated that tropoelastin mRNA was distributed throughout the entire radius of the pulmonary vessel wall in the fetus and newborn calf. By 15 d of age, only cells in the inner third of the media expressed tropoelastin mRNA, and by adulthood no tropoelastin mRNA was detected in the vessel wall. These findings demonstrated that tropoelastin expression shuts off in a spatially specific pattern, moving from the abluminal to the luminal side of the medial in the neonatal pulmonary artery when pressures and resistance are falling. In the aorta of 15-d-old calves, tropoelastin mRNA expression was seen equally throughout the media, indicating tissue-specific regulation of elastin in the neonatal period. In contrast, intralobar pulmonary arteries from calves exposed to hypoxia, which prevented the normal postnatal decline in pulmonary artery pressure, maintained the fetal pattern and levels of tropoelastin mRNA expression at all time points. Thus, rather than causing a recruitment of SMC into an elastin-producing phenotype, neonatal pulmonary hypertension caused a persistence of the fetal pattern of tropoelastin expression in medial SMC. Cell-free translation showed that the same tropoelastin isoforms were made by mRNA from control and hypertensive calves and, unlike the ligamentum nuchae, did not change during the transition from fetal to neonatal life. We conclude that pulmonary hypertension in the neonate perturbs the normal postpartum repression of tropoelastin expression resulting in a persistence of the fetal spacial and isoform patterns of tropoelastin gene expression.	0

17090534	Wnt-mediated down-regulation of Sp1 target genes by a transcriptional repressor Sp5. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates many processes during vertebrate development. To study transcriptional targets of canonical Wnt signaling, we used the conditional Cre/loxP system in mouse to ectopically activate beta-catenin during central nervous system development. We show that the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the embryonic mouse telencephalon results in the up-regulation of Sp5 gene, which encodes a member of the Sp1 transcription factor family. A proximal promoter of Sp5 gene is highly evolutionarily conserved and contains five TCF/LEF binding sites that mediate direct regulation of Sp5 expression by canonical Wnt signaling. We provide evidence that Sp5 works as a transcriptional repressor and has three independent repressor domains, called R1, R2, and R3, respectively. Furthermore, we show that the repression activity of R1 domain is mediated through direct interaction with a transcriptional corepressor mSin3a. Finally, our data strongly suggest that Sp5 has the same DNA binding specificity as Sp1 and represses Sp1 target genes such as p21. We conclude that Sp5 transcription factor mediates the downstream responses to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by directly repressing Sp1 target genes.	1
19740707	AA28-67 domain within MyD88 suppresses c-myc activity and expression to regulate differentiation and function of dendritic cells. The mechanism by which c-myc expression in undifferentiated cells rapidly declines following induction of differentiation is poorly characterized. We demonstrate here that MyD88, which can activate NF-kappaB and MAPK, also suppresses c-myc activity and expression. The aa 28-67 domain, a highly conserved region within MyD88, plays a critical role in the MyD88-mediated inhibition. Indeed, deletion of the aa 28-67 domain (MyD88 Delta 28-67) or mutation of the highly conserved amino acid residue phenylalanine (aa 36) to aspartic acid (MyD88 Delta F36D) significantly promoted c-myc activity and expression. Additionally, we found that MyD88 Delta 28-67-mediated c-myc activity and expression could be abrogated using PI3K inhibitor, suggesting that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be involved in MyD88-mediated suppression of c-myc. Compared to MyD88-transduced DCs, MyD88 Delta 28-67- and MyD88 Delta F36D-transduced DCs derived from MyD88-/- bone marrow cells had lower antigen-presenting ability. Thus, MyD88 induces the differentiation and maturation of DCs not only by activating NF-kappaB and MAPK but also via suppressing c-myc activity and expression.	0

20456796	[Shewhart control charts and the cumulative sum test--the use of clinical data in quality control]. Now that quality control in health care is attracting an increasing amount of attention, every doctor needs to have knowledge and understanding of the basic principles of the most commonly used methods, especially considering that quality control starts with scrupulous monitoring of everyday procedures. The methods in use are based on statistical process control. Shewhart control charts are easy to construct and are principally suitable for the monitoring of a group of results. The cumulative sum test is more suitable for a continuous process control, even of smaller quantities. These methods primarily give a warning signal, with a request for further analysis, rather than giving direct evidence of poor quality.	0

18481998	Function and regulation of the mammalian Musashi mRNA translational regulator. The evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein, Musashi, regulates neural stem cell self-renewal. Musashi expression is also indicative of stem cell populations in breast and intestinal tissues and is linked to cell overproliferation in cancers of these tissues. Musashi has been primarily implicated as a repressor of target mRNAs in stem cell populations. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Musashi exerts mRNA translational control or how Musashi function is regulated. Recent findings in oocytes of the frog, Xenopus, indicate an unexpected role for Musashi as an activator of a number of maternal mRNAs during meiotic cell cycle progression. Given the importance of Musashi function in stem cell biology and the implications of aberrant Musashi expression in cancer, it is critical that we understand the molecular processes that regulate Musashi function.	0
7049055	A case control study of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: association with physical injuries. Sixty cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reported from 902 neurological clinics throughout Japan between 1975 and 1977 were examined in a retrospective case control study. Histories were obtained from patients, sex-matched neighbors, and spouses. No association was observed in either sex with five socioeconomic variables; exposures to eight species of animals; ingestion of raw meat or quadruped brains; eighteen diseases, allergies or immunizations; tooth extraction; blood transfusion; or lumbar puncture. Surgical operations within five years before disease onset were reported for 25.9% and 7.8% of male patients and pooled controls and for 24.2% and 9.6% of female patients and controls. Mechanical injuries were observed for the same period in 33.3% and 9.8% of male patients and controls and in 18.2% and 13.5% of female patients and controls. The operations and mechanical injuries varied in all groups as to body parts affected and nature of the lesions. Physical injuries including operations may be a predisposing factor to the development of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.	0

9582278	Embryonic lethality and liver degeneration in mice lacking the metal-responsive transcriptional activator MTF-1. We have shown previously that the heavy metal-responsive transcriptional activator MTF-1 regulates the basal and heavy metal-induced expression of metallothioneins. To investigate the physiological function of MTF-1, we generated null mutant mice by targeted gene disruption. Embryos lacking MTF-1 die in utero at approximately day 14 of gestation. They show impaired development of hepatocytes and, at later stages, liver decay and generalized edema. MTF-1(-/-) embryos fail to transcribe metallothionein I and II genes, and also show diminished transcripts of the gene which encodes the heavy-chain subunit of the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a key enzyme for glutathione biosynthesis. Metallothionein and glutathione are involved in heavy metal homeostasis and detoxification processes, such as scavenging reactive oxygen intermediates. Accordingly, primary mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking MTF-1 show increased susceptibility to the cytotoxic effects of cadmium or hydrogen peroxide. Thus, MTF-1 may help to control metal homeostasis and probably cellular redox state, especially during liver development. We also note that the MTF-1 null mutant phenotype bears some similarity to those of two other regulators of cellular stress response, namely c-Jun and NF-kappaB (p65/RelA).	1

11166067	Effect of genetic cross on the detection of quantitative trait loci and a novel approach to mapping QTLs. A genome-wide scan was conducted in two F(2) intercrosses, C57BL/6J (B6)xDBA/2J (D2) and BALB/cJ (C)xLP/J (LP), for three different phenotypes: basal locomotor activity, ethanol-induced locomotor activity, and haloperidol-induced catalepsy. For basal activity, significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs, LOD> or =4.3) were detected on chromosomes 9 and 19 for the CxLP intercross and chromosome 1 for the B6xD2 intercross. Significant QTLs for ethanol-induced activation were detected on chromosome 6 for the CxLP intercross, and on chromosomes 1 and 2 for the B6xD2 intercross. For haloperidol-induced catalepsy, significant QTLs were detected on chromosome 14 (two different QTLs) in the CxLP intercross, and chromosomes 1 and 9 in the B6xD2 intercross. These data illustrate the importance of the genetic cross for QTL detection. Finally, the data reported here, and elsewhere, are also used to demonstrate a novel approach to QTL detection and localization.	0

OBJECTIVE: As the population of Australia ages, it is becoming increasingly important that general practitioners have an understanding of the range of services available to people with disabilities. DISCUSSION: General practitioners are well placed to provide information to patients about these services. Appropriate support from blindness agencies can enable people who are blind or vision impaired to live independent lives.	0
17453443	Stabilization technique for columella using trimmed autologous temporal fascia in type III and IV tympanoplasty--Muffler method. CONCLUSION: High success rates of recovery of hearing level in type III and IV tympanoplasty could be achieved by this stabilization technique for columella using trimmed autologous temporal fascia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a new stabilization technique for columella using trimmed autologous temporal fascia in type III and IV tympanoplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 55 patients (21 male, 34 female, aged 4-85 years) with chronic otitis media (n=16) and cholesteatoma (n=39) underwent tympanoplasty using this new stabilization technique for columella. Thirty-one patients underwent type III tympanoplasty and 24 patients underwent type IV tympanoplasty. Forty-two patients underwent a staged operation and 13 patients underwent a single operation. The observation period was 3.5 years from 6 months after the last operation. RESULTS: The overall success rates in type III and IV tympanoplasty were 87.1% (27/31) and 83.3% (20/24), respectively. Two of eight patients for whom the procedure was unsuccessful underwent reoperation and they acquired good hearing.	0
7832133	Relevance of asystole during head-up tilt testing. The prognosis of patients manifesting prolonged asystole during head-up tilt testing is unclear. In 209 consecutive patients with a history of syncope and positive head-up tilt tests, 19 had asystole lasting > 5 seconds (mean duration 15 +/- 10) (group 1a). When compared with patients without asystole (group 1b), group 1a patients were younger (32 +/- 12 vs 47 +/- 21 years, p < 0.005), but clinical manifestations were not any more dramatic (the number of episodes of syncope [7 +/- 5 vs 8 +/- 6 episodes, p = NS] and injury during syncope [2 vs 13 patients, p = NS] were similar). During follow-up (mean 2 +/- 1 year), with the patient taking pharmacologic therapy such as beta blockers, ephedrine, theophylline, or disopyramide, the recurrence rate was 11% and 8% in groups 1a and 1b (p = NS). No patient in the asystole group underwent pacemaker implantation. Additionally, of 75 normal volunteers (group 2) with no history of syncope undergoing tilt tests to define its specificity, 3 had asystole (mean duration 10 seconds). During > 1 year of follow-up, despite no treatment, all 3 are symptom free. Thus, asystole during head-up tilt testing does not predict either a more malignant outcome or a poor response to pharmacologic therapy. Moreover, an asystolic response does not enhance the specificity of the head-up tilt test because it may be present in asymptomatic \"normal\" volunteers.	0
14993249	Mapping of a functional recombination motif that defines isotype specificity for mu-->gamma3 switch recombination implicates NF-kappaB p50 as the isotype-specific switching factor. Ig class switch recombination (CSR) requires expression of activation-induced deaminase (AID) and production of germline transcripts to target S regions for recombination. However, the mechanism of CSR remains unclear. Here we show that an extrachromosomal S plasmid assay is AID dependent and that a single consensus repeat is both necessary and sufficient for isotype-specific CSR. Transfected switch substrates specific for mu-->gamma3 and mu-->gamma1 are stimulated to switch with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) alone or LPS and interleukin-4, respectively. An Sgamma3/Sgamma1 substrate containing only three Sgamma3-associated nucleotides reconstituted LPS responsiveness and permitted mapping of a functional recombination motif specific for mu-->gamma3 CSR. This functional recombination motif colocalized with a binding site for NF-kappaB p50, and p50 binding to this site was previously established. We show a p50 requirement for plasmid-based mu-->gamma3 CSR using p50-deficient B cells. Switch junctions from p50-deficient B cells showed decreased lengths of microhomology between Smu and Sgamma3 relative to wild-type cells, indicating a function for p50 in the mechanics of CSR. We note a striking parallel between the affects of p50 and Msh2 deficiency on Smu/Sgamma3 junctions. The data suggest that p50 may be the isotype-specific factor in mu-->gamma3 CSR and epistatic with Msh2.	0

23504500	Using in vivo voltammetry to demonstrate drug action: a student laboratory experience in neurochemistry. Providing undergraduate neuroscience students an appropriate laboratory experience that demonstrates principles of neurotransmission and drug action is a difficult task. In the following activity, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was utilized to measure dopamine levels using carbon-fiber microelectrodes in rats in vivo. Recordings were made before and after administration of several drugs to assess their ability to alter extracellular dopamine. The following drugs were chosen due to their well established actions: haloperidol, methylphenidate, and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine. Each demonstrated markedly altered extracellular dopamine dynamics and some basic kinetic analysis enabled students to attribute the alterations to differing modes of action. Dopamine tissue content was also assessed to compare the differences between acute drug action and overall neurotransmitter content. Any neuroscience laboratory course that desired to demonstrate principles involved in neurotransmission would be well served by the activities involved. This laboratory experience provided: 1) basic principles in experimental design, 2) small animal surgical experiences, 3) exposure to common instrumentation used in collecting neurochemical data, 4) data analysis procedures, and 5) experience in presenting their findings.	0

AIM OF THIS STUDY: The aim of this study was to compare the mycobacteria growth indicator tube and solid culture for recovery of complex tuberculosis mycobacteria from blood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five specimens from 67 Djiboutian patients with a positive serologic diagnosis of HIV and fever were collected in an Isolator tube. After centrifugation and washing with phosphate-buffer, smears were prepared from the pellet for auramin staining. The remaining sediment was suspended in 1 ml of buffer. One half was inoculated into two MGIT (incubation at 30 and 37 degrees C into Bactec 960) and the other onto two Loewenstein-Jensen and two Coletsos medium (incubation at 30 and 37 degrees C). RESULTS: Eight cultures were contaminated: three on solid medium and MGIT simultaneously, five in MGIT only (three coagulase negative staphylococci, five enterobacteria). Fourteen strains of M. tuberculosis (six patients) and three M. canettii (two patients) (12 on solid media and MGIT, five in MGIT only) were recovered. The mean time to detection was 32.8 days for solid medium and 20.4 days for MGIT. Of a total of 25 patients with culture-proven tuberculosis, two patients had a positive blood culture only, six had blood and other specimens positive culture, 17 had a non blood specimens positive culture only. CONCLUSION: MGIT processed into Bactec 960 is a viable tool for the detection of complexe tuberculosis mycobacteria from blood and the high-frequency of these mycobacteremia in HIV infected patients from country where the prevalence of tuberculosis is high is confirmed. However, the cost/benefit ratio of this bacteriologic diagnosis had to be evaluated in developping country.	0
22573807	The cytoskeletal adaptor protein IQGAP1 regulates TCR-mediated signaling and filamentous actin dynamics. The Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1 is a multimodular scaffold that controls signaling and cytoskeletal regulation in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. However, the functional role of IQGAP1 in T cell development, activation, and cytoskeletal regulation has not been investigated. In this study, we show that IQGAP1 is dispensable for thymocyte development as well as microtubule organizing center polarization and cytolytic function in CD8(+) T cells. However, IQGAP1-deficient CD8(+) T cells as well as Jurkat T cells suppressed for IQGAP1 were hyperresponsive, displaying increased IL-2 and IFN-y production, heightened LCK activation, and augmented global phosphorylation kinetics after TCR ligation. In addition, IQGAP1-deficient T cells exhibited increased TCR-mediated F-actin assembly and amplified F-actin velocities during spreading. Moreover, we found that discrete regions of IQGAP1 regulated cellular activation and F-actin accumulation. Taken together, our data suggest that IQGAP1 acts as a dual negative regulator in T cells, limiting both TCR-mediated activation kinetics and F-actin dynamics via distinct mechanisms.	0
19074257	CTLA-4 blockade enhances polyfunctional NY-ESO-1 specific T cell responses in metastatic melanoma patients with clinical benefit. Blockade of inhibitory signals mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) has been shown to enhance T cell responses and induce durable clinical responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. The functional impact of anti-CTLA-4 therapy on human immune responses is still unclear. To explore this, we analyzed immune-related adverse events and immune responses in metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, a fully human anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody. Fifteen patients were selected on the basis of availability of suitable specimens for immunologic monitoring, and eight of these showed evidence of clinical benefit. Five of the eight patients with evidence of clinical benefit had NY-ESO-1 antibody, whereas none of seven clinical non-responders was seropositive for NY-ESO-1. All five NY-ESO-1 seropositive patients had clearly detectable CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells against NY-ESO-1 following treatment with ipilimumab. One NY-ESO-1 seronegative clinical responder also had a NY-ESO-1 CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell response, possibly related to prior vaccination with NY-ESO-1. Among five clinical non-responders analyzed, only one had a NY-ESO-1 CD4(+) T cell response and this patient did not have detectable anti-NY-ESO-1 antibody. Overall, NY-ESO-1-specific T cell responses increased in frequency and functionality during anti-CTLA-4 treatment, revealing a polyfunctional response pattern of IFN-gamma, MIP-1beta and TNF-alpha. We therefore suggest that CTLA-4 blockade enhanced NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific B cell and T cell immune responses in patients with durable objective clinical responses and stable disease. These data provide an immunologic rationale for the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 therapy and call for immunotherapeutic designs that combine NY-ESO-1 vaccination with CTLA-4 blockade.	0
22733752	Degradation and resilience in Louisiana salt marshes after the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. More than 2 y have passed since the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, yet we still have little understanding of its ecological impacts. Examining effects of this oil spill will generate much-needed insight into how shoreline habitats and the valuable ecological services they provide (e.g., shoreline protection) are affected by and recover from large-scale disturbance. Here we report on not only rapid salt-marsh recovery (high resilience) but also permanent marsh area loss after the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Field observations, experimental manipulations, and wave-propagation modeling reveal that (i) oil coverage was primarily concentrated on the seaward edge of marshes; (ii) there were thresholds of oil coverage that were associated with severity of salt-marsh damage, with heavy oiling leading to plant mortality; (iii) oil-driven plant death on the edges of these marshes more than doubled rates of shoreline erosion, further driving marsh platform loss that is likely to be permanent; and (iv) after 18 mo, marsh grasses have largely recovered into previously oiled, noneroded areas, and the elevated shoreline retreat rates observed at oiled sites have decreased to levels at reference marsh sites. This paper highlights that heavy oil coverage on the shorelines of Louisiana marshes, already experiencing elevated retreat because of intense human activities, induced a geomorphic feedback that amplified this erosion and thereby set limits to the recovery of otherwise resilient vegetation. It thus warns of the enhanced vulnerability of already degraded marshes to heavy oil coverage and provides a clear example of how multiple human-induced stressors can interact to hasten ecosystem decline.	0
10436994	[Correlations between retinal fluorescein angiography and blood viscosity and other factors in patients with primary open angle glaucoma]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlations between retinal fluorescein angiography and blood viscosity and other factors in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). METHODS: Multiple stepwise regression analysis was made to approach the correlation between each of the following blood vessel filling times: the arm-choroid (A-CT), arm-retinal artery (A-AT), and retinal artery-venous (A-VT) of the fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) in 122 eyes with POAG and each of the following related factors in hemorheology: whole blood apparent viscosity at low, medium and high shear rates, plasma viscosity and hematocrit. Also, the same analysis was applied to investigate the correlation between each of the A-AT, A-VT of the FFA in 70 eyes with POAG and each of the following factors: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, age and the whole blood apparent viscosity at low shear rate. RESULTS: The whole blood apparent viscosity at low shear rate was closely related to A-CT and A-AT, while hematocrit was closely related to A-VT of the FFA. The whole blood apparent viscosity at low shear rate and age, especially whole blood apparent viscosity, was closely related to A-AT, A-VT of the FFA. CONCLUSION: The blood viscosity can affect the filling times of the FFA in POAG.	0

16154365	The function, composition and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in companion animals: part I - function and composition. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colourless ultrafiltrate of plasma with low protein content and few cells. The CSF is mainly produced by the choroid plexus, but also by the ependymal lining cells of the brain's ventricular system. CSF flows through the ventricular system and then into the subarachnoid space and it is subsequently absorbed through the subarachnoid villi into the venous system. CSF has several functions in the nervous system. It protects the brain during blood pressure fluctuations, regulates the chemical environment of the central nervous system and it is a vehicle for intracerebral transport. This two-part article reviews CSF function, physiology, analytical techniques and interpretations in disease states of companion animals. This first part will address the function and composition of CSF in companion animals.	0
9534226	Synthetic approach towards sulfated chondroitin di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides corresponding to the repeating unit. Chondroitin di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides, as well as their 4-, 6-mono- and 4,6-disulfates as their 4-methoxyphenyl glycosides, were systematically synthesized. Target disaccharides having beta GalNAc-(1-->4)-beta GlcA sequences were obtained starting from the corresponding pivotal chondroitin disaccharide precursor. A trisaccharide intermediate, which was synthesized by coupling of glucuronate imidate with a known disaccharide acceptor, was transformed into the sulfated and non-sulfated chondroitin trisaccharides. Chondroitin tetrasaccharide and the corresponding 4-disulfate, 6-disulfate as well as 4,6-tetrasulfate were also obtained based on the strategy developed above starting from the reported tetrasaccharide having [beta GalN3-(1-->4)-beta GlcA2] sequence.	0
21672318	A method of utrophin up-regulation through RNAi-mediated knockdown of the transcription factor EN1. The aim of this study was to induce up-regulation of the dystrophin-related gene UTRN that encodes the protein utrophin, to determine whether this could compensate for the lack of dystrophin function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The human UTRN promoter, which contains two putative binding sites for homeobox protein engrailed-1 (EN1), was analysed. It was found that EN1 binding site 2 in the UTRN gene promoter directly interacted with transcription factor EN1 in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the EN1-UTRN promoter complex from rhabdomyosarcoma and HeLa cell lines confirmed that endogenous EN1 interacted with this region in vivo. The findings suggest that EN1 directly interacts with the UTRN promoter. Small interfering RNA was used to inhibit EN1 gene expression. Higher utrophin mRNA levels were observed in EN1-inhibited cells compared with controls. The increase in utrophin mRNA in rhabdomyosarcoma cells and HeLa cells may have resulted from inhibition of EN1 expression.	1
14748425	A university accredited renal nursing course delivered by distance learning. Continuous professional development (CPD) is limited in some regions of the UK and within Europe generally. This is compounded for all by limited resources for course fees and the lack of study leave granted away from the clinical area for full-time courses. This is set against recommendations from national and European governments and renal clinical guidelines concerning expectations of CPD and competency levels of renal nurses. In the past renal nurses have been trained in all areas of the speciality by local Schools of Nursing linked to renal units. However, since the formation of Trusts in 1990 education delivery has been ring-fenced and separated from the control of local hospitals by Schools of Nursing being incorporated into Institutes of Higher Education. That has led in some instances to a rationalising of post registration education delivery for some geographical areas. This paper will discuss the development and implementation of a distance learning renal care course taking into consideration the clinical, academic and educational requirements necessary for effective education and training at the post basic level.	0
20199370	Renal transplant outcome after endoscopic treatment of vesicoureteral reflux using the subureteric injection of calcium hydroxyapatite. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the results of end-stage renal failure in transplanted cases due to vesicoureteral reflux after a subureteric injection of calcium hydroxyapatite (Coaptite). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients (39 renal units) with end-stage renal failure secondary to vesicoureteral reflux were included. Reflux was bilateral in 16 cases and unilateral in 7 of the cases. There were 3 degrees of reflux according to the distribution of renal units. They were low-grade reflux (grades 1 and 2; n=10); medium-grade reflux (grade 3; n=23); and high-grade reflux (grades 4 and 5; n=6). RESULTS: Reflux resolved completely in 17 patients (28 renal units; 71.8%). There was a regression to grade 1 in 3 patients (5 renal units; 12.8%). Twenty-one patients underwent renal transplant; however, 2 of the patients were excluded from the study as it was not possible to monitor them after transplant. Within an approximately 18.6 month follow-up (range, 3-36 months), 1 of the cases had acute, and 3 of the cases had chronic rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Successful results can be achieved in reflux treatment by an injection of subureteric calcium hydroxyapatite before transplant in patients with end-stage renal failure that developed secondary to vesicoureteral reflux.	0
21635914	Chronic cocaine self-administration attenuates the anxiogenic-like and stress potentiating effects of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, FG 7142. Stress is a well-known risk factor in relapse to drug abuse. Several forms of stress in animals have been used with varied degrees of success to elicit reinstatement of drug-seeking after chronic drug self-administration. Here, we tested the ability of the benzodiazepine (BZ) inverse agonist, FG 7142, to elicit anxiety-like behavior and potentiate stress responses in rats as measured by standard behavioral and hormonal indices and for its ability to affect reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in rats with a prior history of cocaine self-administration. FG 7142 elicited anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus maze (EPM) in cocaine-na  ve rats, and cocaine-na  ve rats injected with FG 7142 exhibited increased plasma corticosterone levels following EPM exposure. However, in animals with a history of cocaine self-administration, FG 7142 failed to affect elevated plus maze performance and did not affect plasma corticosterone response to the EPM. Furthermore, FG 7142 failed to reinstate cocaine-seeking, nor did it alter conditioned cue-induced reinstatement. These data indicate that the anxiety-related and stress potentiating qualities of BZ inverse agonism are attenuated in cocaine-experienced animals and do not lead to reinstatement of cocaine-seeking.	0

19020252	Outcome of MRI-guided breast biopsy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the outcome of MRI-guided breast biopsy as a function of the indication for MRI and the MRI features of the lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 154 women (mean age, 51 years) with 172 MRI-detected lesions, MRI-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy was attempted. Using the original radiologic report, we evaluated the indication for the original MRI examination and the MRI findings that led to biopsy. We investigated the core and operative histology results and follow-up data. We analyzed the cancer rate as a function of the indication for MRI and the MRI features of the lesions using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In 22 of the 172 lesions (13%), MRI-guided biopsy was deferred due to decreased visualization or nonvisualization of the MRI finding that led to biopsy. Of 150 biopsies in 134 women, core histology revealed 39 malignant (39/150, 26%), 90 benign (90/150, 60%), and 21 high-risk (21/150, 14%) lesions. Through operative histology (n = 13) or follow-up (n = 30), four high-risk lesions were upgraded to malignancy and all deferred lesions except four lost to follow-up were confirmed to be benign. The final number of malignancies was 43 (29%) including 16 in situ and 27 invasive cancers. The probability of malignancy was different in the screening and diagnostic settings (14% vs 36%, respectively; p = 0.05), whereas it was not different according to lesion type (mass, 34%; nonmass, 27%; focus, 19%; p > 0.05) or kinetics (persistent, 23%; plateau, 31%; washout, 29%; p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The cancer rate in our cohort of women who underwent MRI-guided breast biopsy was 29%. It varied according to the indication for the original MRI examination, but not according to the MRI features of the lesions.	0

8649389	An exceptionally conserved transcriptional repressor, CTCF, employs different combinations of zinc fingers to bind diverged promoter sequences of avian and mammalian c-myc oncogenes. We have isolated and analyzed human CTCF cDNA clones and show here that the ubiquitously expressed 11-zinc-finger factor CTCF is an exceptionally highly conserved protein displaying 93% identity between avian and human amino acid sequences. It binds specifically to regulatory sequences in the promoter-proximal regions of chicken, mouse, and human c-myc oncogenes. CTCF contains two transcription repressor domains transferable to a heterologous DNA binding domain. One CTCF binding site, conserved in mouse and human c-myc genes, is found immediately downstream of the major P2 promoter at a sequence which maps precisely within the region of RNA polymerase II pausing and release. Gel shift assays of nuclear extracts from mouse and human cells show that CTCF is the predominant factor binding to this sequence. Mutational analysis of the P2-proximal CTCF binding site and transient-cotransfection experiments demonstrate that CTCF is a transcriptional repressor of the human c-myc gene. Although there is 100% sequence identity in the DNA binding domains of the avian and human CTCF proteins, the regulatory sequences recognized by CTCF in chicken and human c-myc promoters are clearly diverged. Mutating the contact nucleotides confirms that CTCF binding to the human c-myc P2 promoter requires a number of unique contact DNA bases that are absent in the chicken c-myc CTCF binding site. Moreover, proteolytic-protection assays indicate that several more CTCF Zn fingers are involved in contacting the human CTCF binding site than the chicken site. Gel shift assays utilizing successively deleted Zn finger domains indicate that CTCF Zn fingers 2 to 7 are involved in binding to the chicken c-myc promoter, while fingers 3 to 11 mediate CTCF binding to the human promoter. This flexibility in Zn finger usage reveals CTCF to be a unique \"multivalent\" transcriptional factor and provides the first feasible explanation of how certain homologous genes (i.e., c-myc) of different vertebrate species are regulated by the same factor and maintain similar expression patterns despite significant promoter sequence divergence.	1
8175968	Negative feedback of atrial natriuretic peptides. The present investigation was designed to determine whether atrial natriuretic peptides consisting of amino acids 1-30 [i.e. pro-ANF-(1-30)], 31-67 [i.e. pro-ANF(31-67)], 79-98 [i.e. pro-ANF-(79-98)], and 99-126 [i.e. atrial natriuretic factor (ANF)] of 126-amino acid ANF prohormone have a negative feedback on their own and each others' release. Thirty healthy human subjects were studied with infusion of 100 ng/kg BW.min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Pro-ANF-(1-30) decreased the circulating concentrations of pro-ANF-(31-67) and ANF 51% and 89%, respectively. Pro-ANF-(31-67) decreased the circulating concentration of ANF by 55% and the peptides immunologically recognized by the pro-ANF-(1-30) RIA by 58% [this assay recognizes pro-ANF-(1-30) (50%) and pro-ANF-(1-98) (50%)]. Pro-ANF-(79-98) decreased the circulating concentration of ANF by 40%, pro-ANF-(31-67) by 31%, and the peptides recognized by the pro-ANF-(1-30) RIA by 46%. ANF decreased the circulating concentration of pro-ANF-(31-67) by 40% and the peptides recognized by pro-ANF-(1-30) RIA by 38%. Infusion of pro-ANF-(1-30), -(31-67), -(79-98), and -(99-126) also decreased the excretion of the other atrial natriuretic peptides measured in the urine by 32-84%. Infusion of vehicle only did not result in any decrease in these atrial natriuretic peptides in either plasma or urine. These data taken together indicate that each of the respective atrial natriuretic peptides inhibits the release, rather than breakdown, of each other, as increased breakdown would have resulted in their urinary concentrations being increased. This study further indicates that because pro-ANF-(1-98) was decreased in the circulation secondary to pro-ANF-(31-67) and pro-ANF-(79-98) infusions, they inhibit their own release, as they are both derived from pro-ANF-(1-98).	0
19176868	Gastrointestinal microflora and mucins may play a critical role in the development of 5-Fluorouracil-induced gastrointestinal mucositis. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used chemotherapy agent in clinical oncology practice. Two of its major side effects are mucositis and diarrhoea. The structure of mucins offers mucosal protection, and allows maintenance of intestinal flora by providing attachment sites and preventing bacterial overgrowth and/or penetration. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in mucin secretion and microflora following treatment with 5-FU. Female DA rats were given a single 150 mg/ kg i.p. dose of 5-FU. Rats were killed at various time points after treatment. Control rats received no treatment. Jejunum, colon and faecal samples were collected. Standard microbiological culture techniques were used to identify bacteria, and real-time PCR was used to quantify bacteria in faecal samples. Goblet cells and cavitated goblet cells (having undergone mucus exocytosis) were also counted. Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test, a non-parametric method of testing equality of group medians. Following treatment with 5-FU, we showed decreases in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and an increase in Escherichia spp. in the jejunum. In the colon, 5-FU caused decreases in Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Real-time PCR of faecal samples showed decreasing trends in Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides spp., and an increasing trend in E. coli. Significant increases (P < 0.05) were seen in Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. at 24 h. Goblet cell numbers decreased significantly in the jejunum from 24-72 h, with a significant increase in the percentage of cavitated goblet cells. In conclusion, 5-FU treatment causes significant changes in intestinal flora and mucin secretion in rats. These changes could result in systemic effects and, in particular, may contribute to the development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.	0
10488129	In vivo structure of two divergent promoters at the human PCNA locus. Synthesis of antisense RNA and S phase-dependent binding of E2F complexes in intron 1. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) synthesis is strictly regulated during the cell cycle. To investigate PCNA transcriptional regulation, we have analyzed protein-DNA interactions at the promoter region and in the first intron in quiescent fibroblasts and following serum stimulation. Twenty putative protein-binding sites, distributed in two divergent promoters at the PCNA locus, were identified in vivo by genomic footprinting. These elements bind transcription factors continuously throughout the cell cycle with the exception of one E2F consensus site, located in the first intron at position +583. This E2F site becomes strongly occupied 18 h after serum stimulation, implying that an E2F activator complex plays a role in activation of the PCNA gene at the onset of S phase. We detected a 500-600-base pair-long antisense transcript by Northern blot analysis. This RNA has no apparent coding capacity and is constitutively transcribed from a promoter located within the first intron. We suggest that silencing of the PCNA gene is accomplished through base pairing between sense pre-mRNA and antisense RNA. The binding of S phase-specific E2F complexes at the +583 element may help to overcome the negative effect of the antisense transcript, which results in up-regulation of PCNA expression in proliferating cells.	0
9787129	Analysis of fluid dynamics in perfused glomeruli of the hagfish eptatretus stouti (Lockington) The capillary tuft of glomeruli of the hagfish mesonephros contains both 'low'-pressure and 'high'-pressure glomerular vessels (LPGVs and HPGVs). The existence of the HPGV raised the possibility that pressure filtration could occur in the hagfish kidney when the blood pressure was sufficiently high. Therefore, measurements of glomerular capillary pressure were made in HPGVs and LPGVs whilst single glomeruli were perfused with hagfish Ringer's solution that contained the colloid Ficoll 70. Calculations of the effective colloid osmotic pressure in perfused capillaries were made; these showed that hydrostatic pressures within the HPGV were inadequate to effect pressure filtration except at high rates of perfusion. However, high rates of perfusion provoked perfusion pressures that exceeded the highest values measured in the renal blood supply of lightly anaesthetised hagfish. It was concluded that some process other than pressure filtration must account for formation of the primary urine by hagfish glomeruli. The proportion of the perfusate that became urine, the single glomerulus filtration fraction (SGFF), bore a strong positive relationship to the vascular resistance of perfused glomeruli. Both the SGFF and the vascular resistance were inversely related to the rate of perfusion except when that rate was very high. From these two observations it was concluded that at least two flow pathways exist in hagfish glomeruli: one that has a high vascular resistance and that contributes to the elaboration of the urine, and one that has a low vascular resistance and does not contribute to urine formation. The possible anatomical location of the various flow pathways through hagfish glomeruli and how they may function are discussed.	0
7754725	[Preoperative autologous blood donation and its effects on pulmonary lobectomy]. It was the aim of the underlying study to determine the value of preoperative autologous blood donation and its importance with regard to pulmonal lobectomies. Over the course of three years and a total number of 220 operations, autologous blood was preoperatively deposited in 74 cases. 21 patients did not meet the criteria for autologous blood donation and hence, were omitted from the study. It was found that only 5.4% of the patients who had donated autologous blood required a homologous blood transfusion versus 27.2% in the non-donor group. This would imply, that the necessity for homologous blood transfusion is reduced by approximately 80% in patients depositing autologous blood prior to surgery. Observing a similar haemoglobin in both groups at admission, it was found that autologous blood donors went into surgery with an hb 1.5 g/dl lower than non donors; the levels however adjusting themselves immediately postoperatively. No increased complication rate was found as a result of preoperative autologous blood donation. The data indicate that only 30% of patients undergoing pulmonal lobectomy require homologous blood transfusions. 80% of these patients could profit from preoperative autologous blood donation. For 70% of all patients the procedure would be of no benefit. Bearing in mind the immunosuppressive effect of homologous blood transfusions, which may result in a higher rate of tumor recurrence, we find preoperative autologous blood donation a justifiable procedure even under these circumstances. It would however be beneficial if studies were conducted hereby investigating to what extent similar results could be achieved by preoperative acute isovolemic hemodilution.	0
17436253	Mutations in ZDHHC9, which encodes a palmitoyltransferase of NRAS and HRAS, cause X-linked mental retardation associated with a Marfanoid habitus. We have identified one frameshift mutation, one splice-site mutation, and two missense mutations in highly conserved residues in ZDHHC9 at Xq26.1 in 4 of 250 families with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). In three of the families, the mental retardation phenotype is associated with a Marfanoid habitus, although none of the affected individuals meets the Ghent criteria for Marfan syndrome. ZDHHC9 is a palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the posttranslational modification of NRAS and HRAS. The degree of palmitoylation determines the temporal and spatial location of these proteins in the plasma membrane and Golgi complex. The finding of mutations in ZDHHC9 suggests that alterations in the concentrations and cellular distribution of target proteins are sufficient to cause disease. This is the first XLMR gene to be reported that encodes a posttranslational modification enzyme, palmitoyltransferase. Furthermore, now that the first palmitoyltransferase that causes mental retardation has been identified, defects in other palmitoylation transferases become good candidates for causing other mental retardation syndromes.	0
17367687	Identification and molecular characterization of Salmonella spp. from unpasteurized orange juices and identification of new serotype Salmonella strain S. enterica serovar Tempe. Several Salmonella enterica serotypes were isolated from unpasteurized orange juice samples analysed as a follow-up to an outbreak in 1999 of S. enterica serotype Muenchen in the Pacific Northwest regions of United States. Eleven S. enterica strains were serotyped and identified as S. enterica serotype Muenchen (2), S. enterica serotype Hidalgo (2), S. enterica serotype Alamo (1), S. enterica serotype Gaminera (2), S. enterica serotype Javiana (2) and a new serotyped strain S. enterica serotype Tempe (2). The identity of the new serotype S. enterica serovar Tempe serotype 30:b:1,7:z33 was confirmed by the National Salmonella Reference Laboratory at NCID/CDC, Atlanta. These strains were sensitive to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, tetracycline, streptomycin and sulfisoxazole antibiotics. Isolates were screened for invasion (invA) and virulence (spvC) genes using specific primers for these two genes by polymerase chain reaction. All strains were positive for invA gene giving 321-bp fragment, however negative to virulence spvC gene. For pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, Salmonella strain plugs were made and digested with XbaI and subjected to 18-h electrophoresis. The PFGE patterns were different for each S. enterica serotypes suggesting the several origins of contamination in outbreak. S. enterica serotype.	0
21713321	The effect of decitabine on megakaryocyte maturation and platelet release. Thrombocytopenia is a common feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) has been used to treat MDS with an approximately 20% response rate in thrombocytopenia. However, the mechanism of how decitabine increases platelet count is not clear. In this study, we investigated the effect of decitabine on megakaryocyte maturation and platelet release in the mouse. The effect of decitabine on megakaryocyte maturation was studied in an in vitro megakaryocyte differentiation model utilising mouse bone marrow cells and mouse megakaryoblastic cell line L8057. Decitabine (2.5  M) is able to induce L8057 cells to differentiate into a megakaryocyte-like polyploidy cells with positive markers of acetylcholinesterase and aIIb integrin (CD41). Higher expression of aIIb integrin was also found in primary mouse bone marrow cells and human cord blood CD34+ cells cultured with both thrombopoietin and decitabine as compared to thrombopoietin alone. In addition, we noted a 30% platelet count increase in Balb/c mice 12 hours after the injection of decitabine at a clinically relevant dose (15 mg/m2), suggesting a rapid platelet release from the spleen or bone marrow. Our data suggest that decitabine increases platelet counts by enhancing platelet release and megakaryocyte maturation.	0
7755896	Long-term potentiation and glutamate release in the dentate gyrus: links to spatial learning. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of the anaesthetized rat is associated with a persistent increase in the concentration of glutamate in the extracellular compartment. At the in vitro level, this is mirrored by an increase in the ability of slices or synaptosomes from potentiated tissue to release glutamate in response to a depolarizing stimulus. In both cases, the activity-induced enhancement of glutamate release is dependent on the activation of the NMDA receptor. A similar increase in glutamate release in vitro is observed in the dentate gyrus prepared from rats trained in a variety of learning tasks, including classical conditioning and the Morris water maze. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that similar presynaptic mechanisms are engaged in LTP and learning.	0
11095860	Influenza: New Insights Into an Old Disease. In the United States each year, influenza accounts for an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 deaths, nearly 300,000 hospitalizations, and millions of days lost from work. In the past few years, there has been an explosion of information in the medical literature related to influenza. This paper reviews these latest developments that enhance our understanding of influenza epidemiology and virology and expand our prevention and treatment options. Diminishing the impact of influenza in this country will require continued intense surveillance, increased use of influenza vaccine, and the availability of alternative vaccines and antivirals with the potential for broader protection against shift-and-drift strains of influenza.	0
20393789	Involvement of Th17 and Th1 effector responses in patients with Hepatitis B. BACKGROUND: Local production of cytokines within the liver may play a pivotal role in the regulation of pathophysiological processes during inflammation. CD4+ T cells are regarded as the most prolific cytokine producers. The purpose of this study was to quantify intrahepatic expression of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg-associated cytokines or transcription factors in patients with acute hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and to analyze their relative roles in the promotion and regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver diseases. METHODS: Distribution and expression of IL-17, IFN-gamma, IL-4, Foxp3, and other cytokines in liver tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR. Patients with hepatitis B were compared with patients with chronic hepatitis C, primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, and healthy controls. RESULTS: The frequencies of intrahepatic IL-17 and IFN-gamma-producing cells in patients with HBV-associated liver dysfunction were much higher than that of IL-4 and Foxp3-positive cells. The level of the IL-17/IFN-gamma-positive cell ratio of patients with Child-Pugh class C (1.57+/-0.09) was much higher than that of patients with Child-Pugh class B (1.00+/-.02) or A (0.93+/-0.05). There are more IL-17-producing cells than IFN-gamma-producing cells accumulating in the liver with severe hepatocellular damage. Liver IL-17-producing cell infiltration was positively associated with the grade of liver inflammation in CHB and positively correlated to intrahepatic IL-8 expression (r=0.801, p<0.01) or neutrophil infiltration (r=0.917, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the balance of effector CD4+ Th responses (Th17 and Th1 responses) and regulatory response is an important element of immune regulation. Inappropriate, excessive, and non-specific Th17 and Th1 effector responses may be involved in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated liver inflammation and hepatocellular damage. Th17 response, especially, may exacerbate the inflammatory processes leading to liver failure. IL-17-mediating liver neutrophil recruitment via induction of IL-8 may be one potential mechanism of liver injury in patients with hepatitis B. An improved understanding of the factors that influence the differentiation and function of these cell types in vivo will be of great importance to the future development of immune therapies in HBV-associated liver disease.	0
22188149	Goal setting, social support, and financial incentives in stress management programs: a pilot study of their impact on adherence. Abstract A stress management program was implemented at two worksites to answer the following questions: 1) Is it feasible to design a stress management program that is of sufficient duration to change old habits, is tailored to the specific needs of the individual, and yet is administratively manageable? 2) To what degree does the use of powerful, reliable, independent variables make it possible for program participants to adhere to a stress management goal of their choosing? A program of six months duration that included personal stress management projects attracted a total of 21 participants at the two worksites. They met their weekly personal project commitments more than 80 percent of the time, and significant changes occurred on a measure of social anxiety.	0
16231773	[Laryngeal mask during emergence from anesthesia in intubated patients with asthmatic attack or ischemic heart disease]. We report two patients in whom the presence of a tracheal tube induced asthmatic attack or hemodynamic instability and the laryngeal mask was useful during emergence from anesthesia. Case 1:A 24-year-old man with asthma was scheduled for reconstruction of an amputated finger. After induction of anesthesia and neuromuscular blockade, the trachea was intubated without complications. At the end of 9.5-h uneventful operation under anesthesia with sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen, inhalational anesthetics were turned off. During emergence from anesthesia, bucking with asthmatic attack occurred. Sevoflurane and theophilline resolved the attack, which recurred after termination of sevoflurane. Under deep anesthesia with sevoflurane, the laryngeal mask was placed, and then the tracheal tube removed without complications. The laryngeal mask was removed when the patient awoke uneventfully. Case 2: A 69-year-old man with a recent history of myocardial infarction was scheduled for skin grafting. After uneventful operation, sevoflurane and nitrous oxide were turned off. Multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with hypertension and tachycardia occurred, and necessitated the restart of sevoflurane. Under deep anesthesia, the laryngeal mask was inserted and the trachea extubated, and the patient regained consciousness without complications.	0
